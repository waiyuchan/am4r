Not worth the money: Banks'book Oscilloscope Guide uses large print and offers little information and there are mistakes...There is some useful information there but not worth the high price.,0
"I changed my mind: When I first reviewed this album two years ago, I gave it a glowing reviews. Unfortunately, the album doesn't have too much lasting value. They initially impressed me due to the vocalist's similarity to Maynard James Keenan, but the novelty of that wore thin quickly. The band doesn't have too much aside from that to back them up, leaving a rather average nu-metal band. If they worked at developing a more unique sound, there's definite potential for greatness. But as of this record, that potential is far from fulfilled.",0
"How quickly we fail...: I was initially enthusiastic about these ""scabs"". I followed the instructions carefully but in two repairs, both failed. Don't let these strand you somewhere--they may seem to be working at first. It took 2 weeks for my repairs to prove futile. Oh well, back to the drawing board!",0
DOA Did Not Power up out of the box: DOA product did not power up out of the box. Can't say much more than that.,0
"support: I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product. I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame. That is where the only star I am giving is coming from.I am concerned with having a good supportive bra. I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years. This bra is the farthest thing from supportive. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it. The material is soft, but thin and stretchy. I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again.",0
"Rewriting this man's history.: Dr. Walmsley has given this generation of readers a frank and new look at one of the central characters of the American revolutionary era. His research has revealed a much more complex side to Thomas Hutchinson than was previously disclosed. Governor Hutchinson's tenure during this period of history was at the focal point of colonial uprising and Dr. Walmsley reveals to the reader an understanding of this man's social stance, governmental allegiances, and his true stature as a statesman as Hutchinson rises and falls through the American political landscape of the times.",1
"Canon CLI-8 4-Pack Color Ink Tanks for Pixma printers: This ink produces great photos. The price was right, and they arrived in just a few days. I'd do it again, and that says it all!",1
needs parts: My first gopher lost a suction cup while getting a sack of sugar of a grocery store shelf. I have not been able to find replacement suction cups anywhere. Apparently it will not handle five pound loads as advertised.My second gopher (needed after the first lost an irreplacable suction cup) lost both suction cups while trying to pick up a wrench from a rough concrete floor.I will not buy another gopher until Ontel provides replacement suction cups (preferably free since I've bought two of them and they both failed in the same manner).It seems Ontel's opinion is what do you expect for ten bucks. I expect it to work as advertised and last more than six months. I cannot afford a new one every six months so will try to find a competitor who will stand behind his product.,0
"Awesome: Does what it's supposed to do and did it for a solid year with about 13,000 miles on the car (pontiac vibe 2003)",1
Yeah for Dairy Free!!!: Finally a way to live Dairy Free- I have had so many problems and when I finally discovered how to live dairy free- Thanks to Marilu. The book talks to you like a good friend- not a doctor who talks above you. She has also written lots of follow up books to help you even more with recipes and holidays. Her website marilu.com is the biggest help and she offers wonderful online classes that support all of her program. She is full of energy and common sense advice. She has a wonderful on-line community where there is lots of support and Marilu is very involved. Marilu and her Total Health Makeover have changed my life. Thank you!!!!,1
"Good book if you have 30 minutes to spare: This is a very small book, less than 90 pages, and it took about half an hour to read. I have to say I was confused when I got it and thought I might have ordered it in error but it really is less than 1/4"" thick and doesn't really seem to be a ""book"". I was disappointed when I was looking forward to curling up for a long evening with a good story and I read it during the evening news.",0
"Good way to keep a child's medical history in a single book: I bought this book for each of my children in order to keep their medical history in a single place. I take it with me to doctor's visits and write a synopsis about each illness, etc. I was better about it when they were babies, but try to keep it up to date now as well. Good to keep you organized.",1
"The Best Red Sox Book: This is by far the best Red Sox book I have ever had. It has information on all the Red Sox great teams, plus information on all the Red Sox legends. This book is a must have for any and all Sox fans.",1
"Piece of Crap: It doesn't work! Aside for the fact that the instructions are INCREDIBLY long-winded and confusing, when I finally figured out that all I had to do was put in a AAA battery and ... nothing happened. I checked and double checked. The polarization is right, I cleaned the contacts twice. I don't know what else could possibly be wrong other the product itself just being flawed.",0
"SO EASY!!!!: This blower had to be, by far, the easiest thing I've put together in years. I had it out of the box, assembled and my 3 car garage and driveway were clean in less than an hour total. I used it on the lowest speed and the blower completely cleaned all the debris out of my garage with ease. The blower is not too loud and was, of course, fumelss while I was working. I haven't used the mulcher yet but it appears to be simple enough just by reading the instructions. This has been a great investment for me! And a great surprise for my husband who came home and found a spotless garage.",1
Very Useful Information.: My wife has been using the material in the book and has found it to be very helpful. We have noticed improvement in her arthritis pain and asthma. It is also helping us eat better. Thank you.,1
"great product!!!: definitelyl a good product. I use it for krav maga training and it is definitely a work out. I filled the base with water oppose to sand. The bag is made well with foam inside to kick and punch as hard as you can. The only thing is that the base will slide, so I put a small area rug under it. This seems to helps keep bottom from being damaged and the sliding noise to a minimum. The fact that I did not have to hang the bag and need someone to hold it is why I would recommend this to friends. The height udjustment of the bag is great. It is not really portable, so be sure to have some area to keep/use it as you would and hanging bag.",1
"Breathtakingly bad.....: This video definitely does not live up to the tremendous amount of hype. Though I did not expect it to be as well-done as the original, I had hoped that the animation quality would be at least as good as other Disney sequels (Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.). The quality may be compared to modern Saturday morning cartoons. All the animation staff seem to be Japanese--what's the deal with that--do they come cheaper? The promised new songs were nothing more than background music--no new musical productions here. My four year old seems to like it okay, but I think it's because she loves the characters so much and I feel she will quickly tire of it. I just feel that Disney wanted to make a quick buck off the current ""Princess"" craze and lowered their normally high standards to do so.",0
"I am thankful that I am around to witness this.: Listening to this... Whimsical, sublime and genius, feel free to use any synomym for amazing! I listen to it when I want to shut out the world and go on a sonic trip.",1
Very good: Great progressive release from a band that I had never heard of until I read about them. I decided to give them a try and found their music to be great. You can pick up this CD for very cheap. You will not be sorry. I also found out that they broke up for several years and recently got back together and made a new CD. I'll get that one next!,1
Good colorful poster.: One of my favorite movies / This poster is a very colorful movie poster that I have framed for display. Exactly as was shown.,1
"Excited to read this.: A good friend of mine recommended this book, and I'm eager to get started on it. It's in great condition. Thanks!",1
A surprisingly uninteresting drawing book...: As expected the book covers a very large spectrum of drawing techniques but in a relatively shallow way. I felt as if I had seen most of this material before in other books. Good only for those with little or no drawing experience who need a general overview of techniques.,0
not worth the money: I bought this fan after reading mostly positive reviews. Last time I'll do that. The Fan is very noisy. The thing rattles and hums. I even shock mounted it but still is very noisy. Even worse ... it does not move enough air to even bother turning it on. I am very disappointed in this product.,0
"Gives metalcore a bad name: I'm really sick of the growing metalcore trend in the past months. This CD isn't super terrible, but it's just too trendy and not really metalcore, at all. People buy this Cd and think that atreyu is so hardcore and heavy, its so stupid. If you're a 13-14 girl then you'll probably love this CD and think the dudes in atreyu are hot and sexy goths. Go ahead, follow the trend with Senses Fail, Killswitch Engage, and Avenged sevenfold. But if you want some non trendy true metalcore listen to: Zao, The Agony Scene, Glass Casket, Preminitions of War, etc. And if you're a true metalcore fan, you'll stick around longer than this fad.",0
Good Information: If you are concerned with your health and are a blood type O+ then this is good and important reading. As with anything you must put into effect what you read for it to be of benefitto you.,1
disapointing album by Woody Herman: I've got to tell you when I got this cd I thought it was Tito Puente and Woody Herman and when I listened to it I was disapointed because 6 songs were done by Herman and the 5 were done by Herman and Puente the reason I got it is because I thought the whole album was them together. So I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this album. Don't get this cd.,0
"Great product great tech support.: First RF set worked perfectly. Second set quit after 3 days. Tech support suggested plugging the base station into the cable box (Dish TV). This solved the problem. The headsets are comfortable with great clairity. The aaa batteries last a LONG time.If the problem can be solved, It isn't a problem!",1
"Excellent locks: What's to say? They lock, they unlock. Keys and locks both feel very sturdy, and they unlock extremely easily. I would happily buy more, if for some reason I had that many things to lock.I did not actually use these for travel, so I can't comment on whether the TSA will need to break them when searching your luggage for three ounces of liquid or embarrassing sex toys.",1
"Excellent is the only word for this book.: Such great detail, that I'm sure it will take me many, many reads before I even begin to remember what she has written. This really is like a sourcebook for all things Qabalah. Must-have for anyone seriously studying the subject. One word of warning though-- this is not an ""easy read"" Be prepared to *study* this text.",1
"good read: You kind of see the ending coming long before it actually does, but you still go along for the ride because it is still well written and you want to see if you were right all along.",1
"Ultra Rapid Charger warranty & reliability: This charger has a limited 3 year warranty. Warning: if you do not register the product within 30 days of purchase, the warranty is good for 1 year only. I purchased it on March 9, 2006. The charger stopped working on Oct 29, 2007. It had moderate usage during that time (maybe once a month for 4 AA batteries). It was easy to use and worked fairly well while it worked. I would not purchase from this company again. Based on this experience, I would not trust the quality and reliability of their products.",0
I will not buy from the site: I have yet to purchase this item. What I would like to know is how much shipping is for the gliders?I don't care about free shipping if I were to spend a certain amount. I need to know what it costs just for these gliders?Anyone know? The site is of no use.,0
"misleading and deceptive: I bought TurboTax Deluxe (vs. the regular product) because it came with a ""free"" state tax download. Actually, you need to first buy the state product and then file for a rebate of the purchase price, after jumping through all sorts of hoops and a mound of paperwork. I have long since thrown away the box that the product came in, so guess what: no state tax download.I called Intuit and--after wading through endless voicemail prompts for half an hour--told them this wasn't fair. The customer service rep said ""life isn't fair."" Needless to say, this is the last product I will buy from Intuit.",0
"Funny and enjoyable: I had a great time one afternoon sitting and enjoying these funny, twisted tales. My sisters both younger and older enjoy this book!Fun for the entire family! It definatly earned a five star!",1
"As good as the hype: Realize I'm about 5 years late with this book but wow, what a great read.A must read for any sports fan and those interested in the business of baseball.Highly recommended.",1
"Triman of LI: One of Pattersons best. Having read all of the Alex Cross novels, he and his family and friends seem like old friends. This is one of his best. The only downside, they read fast, I finished it in 5 days.",1
"Wonderful!: This works amazingly well on my door. I have many bags, and this really helped clean up space! I highly recommend it.",1
"The Guard - Blu-ray - Review: This movie had some pretty funny moments. One thing that I had trouble with was understanding just exactly what they were saying. The accents used in this movie are so thick sometimes I couldn't make out what they said at all. Over all though, a pretty fun movie to watch.",1
This book is really incredible: This book is top quality. It is mostly a pictorial but really gives an insight as to the tone of the civil rights era. I would recommend this book highly and I bought several copies for friends. The author is well respected and is the founder of the National Civil Rights Museum.,1
"not polished....: While the actual clip content was an amusing teaser for the Christmas special, I had to get through 30 seconds of test pattern and 30 seconds of the time vortex episode opener before the clip began. Once the clip started it had an echoing quality that was sort of distracting. The entire clip didn't have the kind of production polish one expects in a paid video. This probably should have been free. I won't ask for my money back though. If the actual full length special is as good as the past episodes, it will be worth it to have the tv pass.The first preview clip was better organized, but I saw it for free elsewhere before it was available on amazon. Still worth it in my book if the full episode is made available soon and has no issues with playback.",0
"Not your average horror novel: H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Dunwich Horror"" is an exquisite, and compelling horror story that remains to be one of Lovecrafts finest pieces of literature. The novel is well written with the descriptive flair, and style that only Lovecraft can express. It's not your average horror novel, and a must read for any fan of the horror genre.",1
"Stage play, Not a movie: Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a movie, it's a stage play that had been filmed. Overacting is not my idea of good entertainment. I couldn't even make it through 15 minutes.",0
Wont play in any DVD player: This DVD does not play in either of my two DVD players or on my MAC computer. Unable to read disc and Disc not supported are the readings. Not sure what the deal is with this particular DVD. Will be sending back asap.,0
"...........: Lame, anyone who buys this is clearly an idiot. Nigg* over and over and over to annoying craptastic beats.....rap sucks.",0
"An Awesome Superhero Film!!!: I thought this movie was awesome and just as good as the original. It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!",1
"Well Fed Fish: After the blazing start Badly Drawn Boy made with the debut The Hour of Bewilderbeast album, I reckoned he would be hard pushed to top it. Discounting the ABout a Boy soundtrack (although it is, in my view, an excellent album in its own right, there is no doubt that it is lead to a significant extent by the storyline of the book and film), I have to say that I think the direction taken by the second real album is an absolute triumph. There isn't a duffer among them and the perceptive lyrics accompanied by and melodies, yes, you heard it MELODIES, put it in my top 10 albums of the last year or so.",1
"Just what I wanted: My friend loves this show. She's the one who convinced me to watch it. I enjoy it, but I found out she doesn't own any of the episodes! I found out her favorite season was season five. This is exactly what I was looking for. She was super excited to receive it. :)",1
Be creative: With this fine product you can be creative and save a trip to the store to buy a card that is less personal.,1
cheap and flimsy: I know you get what you pay for. But why even include the rachet. The very first time I tried to use it on a simple tool it broke. I'm thinking the sockets won't hold up under pressure either. Don't buy it. Spend the extra amount to get a decent set.,0
foreman products: amazon canceled my order because it was no longer available so we went somewhere else and purchased the product.,0
"Extraordinarily beautiful collection of Timeless Songs!: Sinatra at his best! The greatest entertainer of all time sings beaufiful ballads originally intended for GIs, with tremendous range and phrasing. The songs are first rate overall and the sound is very passable for 50+ year old recordings - nicely restored by Columbia with the latest sound restoration technology. Highlights of this collection are Long Ago and Far Away, My Shining Hour, Falling in Love With Love (far better than the regular Columbia commercial release), I'll Follow My Secret Heart, Let Me Love You Tonight, They Say Its Wonderful. These alone are worth the price of the two discs! Way recommended!",1
"The Color Bleached: I bought this for my mom when she moved into her new country house 3 months ago. It's an adorable spoon rest and matches perfectly with the coordinating paper towel holder. However, just a few days ago something (I'm not sure what exactly) got on the spoon rest and bleached the color on half of it. Washing, scrubbing, and scratching at the bleached area hasn't helped. This product is not as high quality as I initially thought.",1
"How to Read and Why: Please do not waste your money on this book. Each section is devoted ostensibly to a ""critique"" of a work that Mr. Bloom recommends to his unwashed readers. The sections are actually synopses posing as critiques. Furthermore, any critical comments Mr. Bloom does offer are sufficiently esoteric to be useful only to those already tutored in the study of literature. A better title for this book would have been How Best to Earn Money While Resting on Your Laurels.",0
"Not well-made: Although I rather liked the stiff quality of the sheets - reminded me of sheets that have been hung to dry outside - my fitted sheet ripped at two of the corner seams within about three washings. No, I don't have all that deep a mattress and no, I didn't pull all that hard on the corners. They just aren't very durable. I have another pair from Costco - same thread count - and they're much better made.",0
scariot death forlorn: excellent songwriting..old school death metal with heavy thrash influences...good vocals combinations and heavy guitar riffs...,1
"Great Family Films: Secret of Roan Inish is just a delightful film and not Disneyesque. Whale Rider is fun. Nice for children as they see Irish culture, Maori culture. Wonderful addition to family film collection and appropriate for all ages.",1
Practical information for healthy lifestyle: I used this book for a personal health class. It provided common-sense and practical information. It went more in-depth on some information than I expected and was satisfied with the text.,1
"A winner. You can't go wrong!!!: These shears are indispensable. First they are sharp and stay that way---definitely not to be used by children. They will definitely bone a chicken all by themselves (but I spare mine a little by using poultry shears to cut heavier bone).Easy to handle. But best of all, they come apart and go back together with extreme ease, yet stay together for use. Contrary to the description, it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart. They are well designed with a slot and protrusion arrangement that allow them to be separated for CLEANING with a single motion and to be rejoined the same way. The cap and screw are only necessary for sharpening. You'll wonder how you ever got along without them.",1
What A Waste of Paper: Are you kidding me? This book was HORRIBLE! Every other word was a typo. The story was old and weak. I definitely could not recommend this. Movie? I don't think so.,0
"Weak Acting and Screen Play: This is a horrible PBS Mystery compared to the British ones. The acting is weak. For people who have not read the book, the ending left many questions unanswered like why were the first two murders committed?",0
"Sophisticated lady: When I ordered this, I thought it would be an arrangement I could use but after seeing it and hearing the CD recording, I was disappointed. It's a whole different version one in which I cannot use. I will just keep looking around for another version.",0
"Excellent Stick: I just got this joystick from circuit city and all I had to do was put the installation CD in, plug in the joystick, and it works great. I am running windows XP, and had no problems at all installing this, unlike some other joysticks.I use this stick mostly for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, and it works great with it. Flying, landing, taking off, everything works well. The stick is definetly worth the price.",1
Not safe!: I bought this product for my infant and when I went to the fire station to have the seat installed (with the bundle me in it) the fireman told me that this product should not be used! He explained that it interferred with the harness and if we were in a crash the baby could come flying out or have serious injuries!! I wouldn't recommend it but I would recommend the shower-cap style covers that don't go behind the baby but just over the outside of the infant seat.,0
"DOCUMENTARIES STINK!: If amazon had indicated that this was a docu-DVD I would not have purchased it! One does not really get to see the artist performing except for clips from here and there. The remaining band members tell their history from how they got their name and when and how Janis joined the Holding Company, interesting but to much talking and to little music!Unless you are into documentaries - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD!",0
"Loved the movie: My wife likes this movie more then I. We watched it married, after one kid, and then after our second kid. Just gets better and better.",1
"Excellent book: My son is only 4, but is an advanced reader/listener. He really enjoys the book. Initially I got it for him because he was interested in snails, but I think he likes the school aspect, and the three different adventures in the book (his first chapter book). If this book was part of a series I would definitly try others.I also found some of the dialogs and illustration to be amusing for adults as well.",1
"Not as shown: What I received contained only the piston and cylinder. It did not contain the resevoir and hose as shown. I requested a replacement, was told it was on backorder, so I held on to the first one just in case. I received the replacement identical to the first about a month later, still missing the resevoir. I'm keeping one and just returned the other as it's still a competitive price. My main complaint is that I didn't get what was shown.",0
"1 star for Amazon's lack of region info not Laputa!: IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BLU RAY/DVD VERSION OF LAPUTA,BOTH THE BLU-RAY & DVD FOR THIS UK RELEASED VERSION ARE REGION B LOCKED! THEY WILL NOT PLAY ON REGION A/US STANDARD BLU RAY PLAYERS OR US PLAYSTATION 3 GAMING CONSOLES!

"waste of money: if you want the best of the rolling stones, do yourself a favour and buy ""hot rocks"" and ""rewind"" instead...hot rocks has all of the essentials from the 60's and early 70's, and rewind covers the late 70's and early 80's...after this period, the stones stopped writing good songs and simply regurgitated their past successful formula, which is evident on forty licks...don't get me wrong, i love the stones, but forty licks is an unnecessary compilation, as the new songs are bad and all the good stuff is available on hot rocks and rewind, and this is why i feel it only deserves 1 star.",0
Great Book: This book was heartfelt and inspirational. I was drawn to the book because the author graduated from my alma mater and I was suprised at his depth of story telling and humor. The book is a great opportunity to rediscover one's love for animals and their ablity to teach us lessons to live by.,1
"Another #1 hit by R.: I have been a huge fan of R. since his debut in the early 90's. To date, he has never let me down. He is an extremely talented young man, and as long as he keeps writing songs that makes me feel good,and brings me great pleasure, I will continue to support him now, and always. The cd is off the hook, and I strongly recommend it to those who knows how to appreciate great music. He is innocent until proven guilty- so please stop judging him. R. keep your head up and god bless.",1
"Young Lucy Deserved Better than This Movie!: According to Lucille Ball's autobiography, ""Love, Lucy,"" Lucy had a mild nervous breakdown during the filming of this movie, due to outside personal problems. That explains a lot about the way she LOOKS in this film. I am the biggest Lucy fan on earth, and she handles her lines very well, but there is an empty-eyed, haunting sadness and apathy about her in this movie that just doesn't seem like her at all. Also, the plot is a little weak, but over-all, it isn't that bad. I saw it on AMC, and enjoyed it, but I don't think I would buy it, when there are so many other great old movies out there.",0
"Middle of the road or on a clear day.: These GMRS radios have very limited range on land. If on water and in a low radio noise area they actually may get 18 miles but everywhere else maybe only two miles on hilly land and 0 feet if behind a hill. It's not the GMRS radio but the frequency in the VHF band. There are repeaters which will extend the range. The NOAA radio section works very well but I have not USED the alert portion. Over all it was what I expected. Don't count on the advertisment of ""18 miles."" Also, you need an FCC license to use this radio. $85, and it cannot be used for business purposes, although I see this all the time. This could cause you to have a fine of $10,000 and 5 years in the pokey if you disrupt communications.",0
"Why so much acclaim?: I read all types of books, but when I picked this one up in the entry section of Borders recently, and noticed how much acclaim it had received, I thought I was in for a good read. Something a little deeper. I enjoyed reading it, and it read quickly, but, it was a little too soap-opera-y for me. Perhaps it bordered on a romance novel - which is one book type that I am not a fan of.I really do like a lot of the ""chick lit"" books, and I'm not sure this one quite qualifies, but I was disappointed in this one. I probably won't hunt down this author's other titles, given my experience with this one.",0
"Nice exterior, bad innards!: I stupidly ignored a friends advice who owned one, and purchased because of the design. It rarely toasted evenly (bread/waffles) nor did it handle bagels well. Now after 3 years, it is dead.So for 80 bucks you get poor performance, good looks, and a warranty which expires before it does. Nice job Cuisinart! You won't fool me with ANY of your other products.",0
"Pajamas: These pjs are so comfortable and fit so well. I have, believe it or not, slept much better since I got them.",1
Black Onyx Silver Pendant: This is one of my favorite pendants. People notice it's an unusual design and really like it.,1
SLING BLADE: THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME IN A STRANGE WAY. I LOVED THE ACTING AND THE LESSON LEARNED EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SOMETIMES HURTFUL. BILLY BOB THORNTON DID A GREAT JOB AS WELL AS THE BOY WHO PLAYED THE 'SON.',1
Pointless: He starts off with a great premise -- that civility is absent in our society and then to identify and correct the problem to bring us back to greater consciousness. This book is unlike Road Less Traveled and is intellectually lazy. His arguments are shallow and undeveloped and this book is tedious and laborious to read. Very little substance or insight on these pages. I'd give this book a pass.,0
"Great movie, poor transfer though: Fans of movies on Egypt, Biblical times as well as anything that talks about the ancient world will love this. I won't spoil the movie, suffice to say that this is the story of a young king caught in a battle with the old order and who has to face more than just one foe when he wants to change things.Pharaoh has been hailed as the ""lost filmic treasure"" and truly this is the case.So much about the story. The reason why I only give 2 stars to this is because the transfer onto DVD has simply not worked. It is very poorly done and the quality of the picture is simply not acceptable in that day and age. I already have a German version of this movie and the transfer and quality of the picture is superb. But I wanted it in English and am quite disappointed about this version.",0
"BEWARE OF STEAM - DO NOT BUY FOR PC: The only thing more horrifying than the zombies in the game is the STEAM co (Steam is an online service offered by Valve Corporation). They take Total control over the game itself and you cannot deal directly with the Valve co. They have no phone numbers (well, one Dead one)!!!! No one to contact but steam on line. I have found they will not help you with any problems. I wish I read the problems other people had Before I bought the game. This is a Real answer they sent me:""Hello M,A staff member has replied to your question.We will not be able to assist you with this issue.The thing is, I sent them the problem and THIS WAS THE RESPONSE. They will not answer any more !?!?Great game but Do Not Buy it for PC.",0
"Alot better than wooden cutting boards!: I bought this board as part of a two-board package deal, and I really like it. It cleans up very well, and has held up better than any cutting board I have had. Buy this one instead of a wooden one!",1
Dont buy one of these shafts they dont stand behind ther products: they sent wrong shaft and would not pay for return .I will not order from them again. It was less money buying it local,0
"Wrights' houses at their best: There are many different aspects to highlight when studying the work of one of Americas' greatest architects. The part of his work that is probably the most accesible, are his private houses. It was great to see all these houses together in one beautiful volume. The photographs are stunning, and it is great to see so much attention paid to the interior of these houses, as Wright was responsible for most interior design too.As a professional or just a fan, when you love Wrights' work and want to visually enjoy it to the fullest, this book is a must have. The only thing better is to buy one of his houses...",1
"LEASE, the movie: Everytime I see a commercial for RENT, I get the song ""Everybody Has AIDS"" from the RENT spoof in TEAM AMERICA stuck in my head. Anybody else?",0
"Does not meet expectations: The fur on these boots does not look or feel real. The fur is not soft, and does not fluff up. I bought 2 pair for my daughters, one brown and one black. I am sending both back for a full refund. They looked a little big, too, but the girls didn't get a chance to try them on before I sent them back.",0

"Awesome.: I got this book on Christmas Eve, and I started reading it the day after Christmas. I tried not to finish the book in one day, I really did. But the book was just too good, I just had to know what happened next. I'm a die hard Dekker fan, and he didn't let me down.Great book. Just read Black, Red, and White before these.",1

"My old RCA VCR is worth repairing: I agree with the reviewer from Los Gatos, CA. I bought this model for the simple set-up and for compatabilty with my RCA TV, but returned it due to poor playback quality on SLP tapings.

"illusive: This item was never shipped and is still outstanding. I have sent several request for you to follow up but never received a response to my inqueries. I would like to know if you're going to pursue this matter and send me the book in question, an $11.00 item, or lose me as a customer. Considering the purchases if have made from Amazon you should really choose the first of the two options.I'm hopeful you will not ignore this last request of mineSincerelyW.Herbert Warnick",0
"A book you cannot put down until it is finished!: When I read some of the very different, conflicting reviews of this book, it made me instantly curious to find out what all the fuss was about - and I was hooked from page one. I was unable to put it down, so engrossed had I become by the fiery, passionate love affair between Genevieve and Tristan, which was utterly believable, and did not seem at all contrived. Yes, I can understand that some readers may not approve of some of the contents, ie the hero more or less raping his love interest after she tried to kill him, but, for better or worse, the book was never once boring, the historical detail well researched, and all characters credible. I haven't enjoyed a novel this much in months!",1
"You must see the live versions to fully appreciate: I do agree with most reviewers below re: the studio versions (the versions on this CD) being lifeless and lacking the intensity that Robert Johnson's songs require. However, you must hear the EC 2004 tour live versions of Me And The Devil, They're Red Hot, Milkcow Calf Blues, If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day, and Kind Hearted Woman Blues. Clapton coverning the blues needs to be heard live - most of Eric's classic performances of the great blues songs are best heard live. (exception: Derek and the Dominos studio versions of Key To the Highway and Have You Ever Loved a Woman).I give this CD 2 stars due to the lame production. However, it was a great concept. They just needed to perform these 14 songs in front of a live audience and recorded the result!!Go see Eric if he is plays your hometown.",0
what the hell: what the hell why do u buy this crap! i cant belive this this is sickk . all the songs smell.dont buy this all the songs copiedfrom diffrent singers.just waste of 20$,0
"Inked For Life: When it comes to high-quality printers, HP has made some of the best ones for the past several years, that really continue to thrive. That also continues to go the exact same way for their ink cartridges. The HP 21 Black Inkjet cartridge is sleek and eay to install, unlike older and bulkier cartridges that take up so much space, and are difficult to install. This ink cartridge works mainly on the HP Deskjet 3900 series, and prints great copies of files from your printer. Although you can't buy any refill kits to refill these cartridges unlike other ones, I still recommend this as a must buy if your printer requires it. Ink up, and print out!Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+",1
"Worthless: I was very excited to finally get my new stereo installed when I get a call from the installer. He says the wiring harness is defective.

Now I'm out even more time and money, do not buy.",0
"KV 8400 Series Full Extension Percision Ball Bearing Slides Self Closing 22"" 100# Class (Set) W/ Overtravel: The Tool Box Drawer Slides that I purchase are a great buy.They are heavy duty with a weight limit of 100 pounds,which I can really load these drawers down with tools.The only thing that you have to watch when buying these slides is; when they list these as one, they are referring to a pair of two, not one. I only needed one set for one drawer, so I ordered two because I though that one meant just that; one. when I received my slides I had two sets of two per set, which I didn't need but one set. Now I have a spare set which I hope I never need.",1
"The Righteous Revenge Of Artemis Bonner: Personally, I think that this book is a bit scary for people who get scared very easily and are under 12. Anyway, I found this book quite interesting, the way it is written. This book takes place in 1880 in a old town around the Alaskan Territory. The things they mention may be frightning - like the was Lucy Feather dip ripping off Artemis's ear with her mouth, while she is hanging upside down.The story they includes some eveidence if how it was baak then in the 1800's, like having very cheap things like accomodation. The way they spoke is also different like: ""Where are you headed?"" Instead of "" Where are you heading?"".You should read this book if you are interested in all the things I have mentioned.Thank you!Celia:)",0
"DEPRESSING: I read to be entertained, and reading of some fictional character's endless depression and inner turmoil is not entertaining. I am fed up with main characters that are suffering endless inner turmoil. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is extremely well written.

I will place them in my bookcase and they will look so much nicer than most speakers. They problem is that I have not been able to find on the internet the actual speakers that go in them. I think they are available in a set but I just want two of the small size that fit these holders. The set has speakers of several different sizes.

"Can't use this program: This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is ""limited to crashes, error messages and lockups"". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.",0
"Poor Battery Life: I have the same problem as all the other reviewers. At first I thought I was turning on the phone when I was putting it down, and coming back to find it almost dead. After more careful observation, I found out the battery goes from 3 bars (full) to dead within a matter of minutes. I follow all the procedures for recharging NiCd- even letting the battery go completely dead between recharges. The phone is now just under a year old, and I was thinking about getting a new battery, but I don't think so after reading the other reviews. I'm very dissapointed.",0

"Not Free SF Reader: Girl sold into sex slavery by mum to dodgy lecher guy, uses laterfound hotness for politics. Becomes happy.Yeah, you are right, that doesn't sound that interesting. This book doesn't work too well as a fantasy, and it isn't an erotic novel, either, and is just way, way too long. However, I suppose you could use it for a paperweight. It is set in the same world that the considerably better Shardik is, but earlier in time.",0

Panzers or T-54s?: Partial review: I just saw the first 20 mins of this and noticed the Germans called the Russian tanks 'panzers.' Is it just me or weren't the German tanks called panthers(panzer) or tigers(tiger) and the Russina tanks called T-54 or T-74(I may be off on the numbers)? It just kind left me a little baffled. It started good though. I'll finish my review once I finish wataching it this weekend. I just had to get that off my chest.,0
"Ma's Exquisite Performances Of 20th Century American Music: Yo-Yo Ma's performances of these three cello concerti are extraordinary, filled with sizzling pyrotechnics on his cello. Yet they are also very graceful, warm performances. All three scores are meditations on death and dying. I don't know whether these works will become part of the classical music canon, but in Ma's hands they are treated with much reverence. Under David Zinman's baton, the Philadelphia Orchestra gives Ma ample support in exquisite performances of their own which never detract from Ma's brilliant playing. It's truly amazing that such wonderful music was played and recorded around the time of a raging snowstorm.",1
"Not bad.: I like Rollin's style of writing. He keeps you interested. This book is much better than Sandstorm though, which I wasn't crazy about. I like that he can put in a little Indiana Jones-esque magic now and then in his books because so many of these thrillers try so hard to make everything scientifically possible that it gets annoying reading about this or that supposedly real piece of army junk. I prefer Rollin's to Dan Brown, but I can't say why. This is a good book though. His best [...]",1
"stick with it: I can only suppose it had been too long since I read the previous book in this series, because I was completely lost in the first few chapters. It's not just because the authors kept referring back to them, but because they were referring back to such insignificant people and events. Obviously, there are many strong characters that have such small parts that it takes away a bit from the focus of the story.Despite this, this book is still quite enjoyable. If you can hang through the beginning, the action starts rollercoasting from then on. Lots of action and suspense. Tony and Sue are having a bit of marriable problems that they have to work out. Tony gets to meet Lucus. Bobby finds an interesting female. Then there is the creature killing Sazi that Tony agrees to find and kill. Then there's a small reappearence of the teenage mass murderer, Scotty. Sooooo many characters, so little time. Focus, authors, focus.",1

"Definitely wasn't made for LX2: I don't recommended this case at all. This case was probably made by someone who had no clue. I can't believe Panasonic would put their name this.The case seems to fit right, but you can't close the flap as it doesn't fit. I wish the flap is a little bit longer. So you have to press down and snap to the velcro. Add insults to the injury, the belt loop is unusable. It is just all wrong.",0
Damaged machine: I ordered this generator on sale at Amazon. It came with free shipping. Well you get what you pay for. When I received it the bottom of the box was open and some of the paperwork was missing as well as the entire frame of the machine being bent out of shape. When I called buffalo tools about it the technician suggested beating it back into shape with a hammer. He was serious. Apparently this is a common problem because he told me where it was bent! When I indicated this might cause further damage I was told to take it to a local repair shop. Well I ordered it around thanksgiving and we are getting close to Christmas and its still in the shop. It has never even been started. This machine needs better packaging for starters. I will write another review when it actually is used.,0
Junk: My 10 year old wanted this pen cause it looked cool. It's junk. The batteries move around in the battery compartment and you have to reinstall them for the light and laser to work. It writes ok and the stylus is there but it's sharp on the end so i wouldn't actually let him use it on his nintendo ds it could scratch the screen. It's ok for a kids gift for the price but for an adult to use it wouldn't be worth carrying around.,0

"Confusing: THis could have been a good film but I just found it confusing and certainly not one promoting christianity . The christian youth leader picks up the guy when he is car less and drunk and begins to influence him to join the church. After joining, his parents divorce and his girlfriend admits she is pregnant. He persuades her to keep the baby against her wishes and nearly makes another young person kill himself when he offends him in public. This is after he becomes a christian!. No answers are given to any of the question and in the end the obvious happens. Baby goes to other parents. Strange to be made by Christians yet paint such a bewildering story.Its got a lot of positive reviews here from the christian support but elsewhere reviews are very poor. I am not surprised Rotten tomatoes a common reviewing site gives it 19 out of 100 by reviewers in total.",0
"The best: I had one of these growing up (I'm thinking we got it in the late 90's) and it worked perfectly until when we last used it (2010) when it mysteriously disappeared. We had thought that they were discontinued because the cheapest we could find this was like $70, but now that it's on Amazon for $40 it might just be a purchase I make myself for my apartment. Haven't had hot chocolate like this thing made since it went missing.",1
"FINALLY RELIEF: I was about to give up hope having just returned a completely unusable support belt. Then after reading several opinions I decided that this seemed sensible. Before it arrived I was helpless. It arrived. I put it on with little difficulty and a miracle occurred. I have used it for over a week. All types of exercise, dancing, etc. No problems. The only thing that would make it a five star would be to have two small belt loop like straps on the wings over your hip bone. This would secure the device and the waist strap in place no matter what you were doing.

"Stunning.: Death in Venice, is a visually alluring portrait of obsession, decay, beauty, and mortality. The dialogue is scarce, but I believe the film would not have worked out, if otherwise.You may or not like it, I can not say you will, like others have said, it is not for everyone, but I must say it is, for me, one of the most beautiful, touching films I have ever seen, if not the most. I found myself, entranced in a strange everlasting spell. I somehow, felt, Bogarde's emotions, and like him, I followed Andresen through the degenerated streets of Venice. I adored, idolized, the feeling of contrast, the imagery, between the decayed, horrific characters Bogarde/Gustav found in Venice, and the exquisiteness of a fifteen-year old boy.And you can never, ever go wrong with Mahler.",1

"I Would Have Given Zero Stars But That Wasn't An Option: This book is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever read.

"The original epic fantasy: I have loved this movie since my childhood. Having rewatched it recently, I see that its special effects are a little dated and the story is predictable, yet it is easy to see this movie's influence in cinema.

"Bond really losing its appeal: Unbelievably bad. Maybe I've become jaded, but has anyone seen a poorer excuse for a plot recently? There's barely enough time between things blowing up and unnecessary ""bullet time"" effects to tell a coherent five minute story. Clearly, the producers of this film do not realize that spending even half as much money and attention on the story would have saved them about $50 million in special effects.What happened to character development? 500 extra explosions is not a substitute for good dialogue, suspense or purposeful action. Even Goldeneye (with a remarkably similar superweapon) had more believable characters. And The Thomas Crown Affair was far sexier with great plot twists and momentum.The lack of chemistry between Brosnan and Berry is stunning. They're both likable actors, but have nothing to work with here. This series is turning into a very long commercial for Jaguar, Aston Martin, Omega watches, etc. Very disappointing from a big Ian Fleming buff.",0

"Doesn't work with 3/4"" drywall: From step 1: ""Feet are preset for 1/2"" sheetrock, be sure that the box will be flush with the finished ceiling.""The distance from the bottom of the bar to the bottom of the 2x4 is 1"", and the box is 1.5"", so it works, if your drywall is 1/2"" thick. If your drywall is 3/4"" of an inch thick, then you would need to add a 1/4"" thick board or something between the box and the bar (don't know if that's a good idea, the instructions say nothing about what to do if your drywall isn't 1/2"" thick.)There is nothing in the product description or the outer box stating you need 1/2"" sheetrock, so I'm giving this 1 star.Also, it only comes with one wire ""clamp"", you might need three.",0
"the darkness of grief: My desire to read this book came, from all places, the Today Show. Jonathan Franzen was on to introduce this book club selection and the author. Besides my willingness take a recommendation from an author I admire, I was drawn to the themes. In the darkness of grief can hide the true elements of man. Haslett shows that transformation occurs when we are faced with the hardships of life and when we realize the darkness within ourselves. I've often thought that grief serves as such a dramatic turning point for people that it would make a fantastic starting point for a story, though I have yet to capitalize on this notion. Haslett tends to look at people who are stalled or so overcome by grief that they are ruled by it. While the theme sort of takes over the collection, Haslett really accomplishes great things. In many ways it is obviously a first effort, but it hints at great things to come.",1

"Bob Moses as a Facilitator: This biography of Bob Moses coincides well with my personal interviews of him as a planner and facilitator in encouraging local Mississippians in their quest to overcome their oppression at the hands of official and unofficial Mississippi. He not only led by example, he brought out the leadership qualities of poor, rural and illiterate Mississippians who then led themselves in fighting Mississippi's ""closed society."" He worked at the invitation of the movement leaders of the 1950's --Amzie Moore, C.C. Bryant, Webb Owens, and E.W. Steptoe-- and established an important link between the older civil rights movement in the state with the student movement of SNCC, CORE , and COFO.

If you haven't seen this movie I would advise that you would get off-line and GO RENT IT!! It's my fav movie along with She's All That and it desirves 5 STARS!!",1
shirt stays for short folks: These products are according to photo what I want. Upon a timely arrival and easy purchase I was disappointed to find that when adjusted out fully they do not fit well. I am <6' tall and I would consider that average. When sitting down they were hard to stretch to fit and standing they do not want to stay together. I had to cut them and have material sewn in between to lengthen so that they were comfortable.,0
"Nonsensical: This film is annoying. I generally think Michelle Williams makes good choices, but I can't understand what she saw in this material. I didn't care for any of the characters, and the story is inane.",0
"Dr. Arem Saved My Life!: I highly recommend this book to anyone who suspects they might be having a thyroid problem. It is well-written and you don't need a medical degree to understand it. I struggled with symptoms of hypothyroidism for 4 years and saw an internist, my ob/gyn and an endocrinologist. None of them would listen to me. They just wanted to give me an anti-depressant and send me on my way. After reading Dr. Arem's book, I scheduled an appointment. With 1 week, I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. A week after that, I had surgery. I'm 2 years out and doing great, thanks to Dr. Arem!",1
"A funny and sweet true-to-life adoption story.: Tell Me Again: About the Night I Was Born is an account of that wished-for moment in every prospective adoptive parent's life: the phone call that brings them and their child together. Written in a sweet, easy language that a young child can understand, this book portrays both the magic and drama that accompany this momentous event. I've read the book a mere two weeks before our own call came and read it again upon returning home with our new son. I found so many similarities between the book and our own experience it brought tears to my eyes. It's a book I would love to share with my son when he is a little older. Any adopted child who has ever wondered ""How did I come to be with you?"" will be enriched by the magic this book conveys. The accompanying illustrations are vivd and happy, enriching the text and adding to the festive atmosphere. This book is all about love, and the message comes through loud and clear",1
"Don't believe the hype.: OK, so it's got a nice cover and got some good reviews, but come on! It's boring, and who cares about the main character? It's hard to get behind a character who hates and complains about everything yet is a toal hypocrite since she acts just as poorly as the people she bashes.Fashionistas - in the same category - is a MORE ENJOYABLE book. The story is fun and the writing is witty and humorous. I actually laughed out loud through most of the book.",0
"because ""you'll never make a baby off'a rap""....: i'm just an ordinary guy. i get up. i go to work. i hide from the boss. then i come home...and then? AAWW SH-NAP...IT'S ON!!! ...or at least i think it's on...and teddy is the guy helpin' me to get my hopes up! brothas, c'mon now, ya'll have GOT TO have this in your collection. if not for you, then for her...(which WILL lead back to you! trust me).",1
"Die-Hard Tori Fan: I think this is probably her best album so far. Aside from Little Earthquakes, this is the only other album that really shows what she can do. I of course, love all of her albums (and was fortunate to see her twice in concert..and I must say, she is quite a performer), but I listen to From the Choirgirl Hotel the most out of the 4 Tori Amos CD's I own. This is definitely worth listening to!",1
"I LOVE YOU LIZ BABY: When I saw Roger Corman as the executive producer, I had to see this. The movie had his fingerprints all over it. A great cheesy production with drama, poachers, infidelity, jazz records, fat hicks, dashing leading men, and of course giant leeches. Yvette Vickers stars once again as a sleazy woman who likes to dress scantily in front of her husband's buddies and listen to loud jazz. Of course Yvette and her swamp lover Michael Emmet can't run faster than the obese Bruno VeSota can walk.Ken Clark plays the game warden who answers his door exposing his blond hairy chest. The leeches look like men in cheap rubber suits. They keep their prey alive in a cavern and suck blood from them from time to time.Bad acting and bad script. Great entertainment.",1
"Wow...he is an idiot (or whoever wrote it): This book was written like a 17 year old suffering from ADHD. It jumps around and repeats itself so much, it's difficult to follow an even flow. He comes off a little like a braggart and kind of a dunce with very little depth to him. Its too bad, I like him as a ball player, but the book made my head spin.",0
"Works Great with MacBook Pro: This bluetooth keyboard is an excellent alternative to the little aluminum keyboard Apple is selling these days, especially if you like or need a dedicated number pad. The Mac special keys all work as expected, and my computer doesn't seem to have any trouble making and holding the bluetooth connection. I haven't had the keyboard long enough to speak to battery life, but Apple's small bluetooth keyboard eats batteries pretty voraciously, so I expect this to be at least that good.The keyboard is less modern looking -> it more closely resembles the Apple II keyboards, both in terms of looks and in terms of action, than it does the newer aluminum keyboards with their nearly flat chiclet keys. I actually like having some tactile feedback, so that works better for me, especially with the ability to raise the top of the keyboard. One thing that was surprising, however, is that the keyboard is nearly as wide as my keyboard tray. Plenty of room on this thing.",1
Not healthy: I think that whoever is writing a cookbook for kids should have a background in nutrition and should consider teaching kids to have a healthy eating habits. If you want your child to have good eating habits when he/she grows up this book isn't for you.,0
"Not Quite Tapeless: I bought this item for my son-in-law. The first shipment was received broken. Amazon gladly replaced it. The replacement process was easy. My son-in-law has a extended cab Chevy pickup. The installation for the main side windows is tapeless. The visors clip into the window molding channel. The visors for the extended cab windows are installed using the provided double-sided tape. These windows do not have a channel like the front windows. The tape provides sufficient holding power for the rear visors. We were hoping for a completely tapeless system, we are satisfied with the look and fit of this product and would recommend it to friends and family.",1
"Simple cat toy: I noticed my cats liked to play with the ring that came off a new gallon of milk, but it was easily lost or destroyed. So when I found the colorful cat springs toy I thought my kitties might like it. Did they ever! They loved it, and it scooted easily across my wood floors for a rollicking game of soccer between the kitties. You get quite a bit in a pack, and I ordered an extra pack (the price is excellent) for a Christmas gift to my parent's two cats that found it equally fun. A great, well made, simply toy that I will always keep in my toy box.",1
"Am I the only one who finds the message of this book troubling?: I've never quite understood the appeal of this book. I received it for my baby shower along with some other board book classics and had never read it before. I immediately returned it. All I could think was -- wow, this bunny really hates his mother. Maybe if the mother would give him a little space he wouldn't put so much of his energy and imagination into how to get away from her! Especially the part about if he were a sailboat who she'd turn into the wind to blow him where SHE wanted him to go (not to be the wind in his sails). And he only even wants to stay with her in the end because clearly trying to have any independence is a lost cause. It's not like it occurs to him how much she presumably loves him. Ugh. If you are looking for a lovely children's book about unlimited love, consider PK Hallinan's ""How Do I Love You"" or Susan Roth's ""My Love for You.""",0
"great plot, terrible writing: Okay, maybe terrible is a little too harsh. But the editor in me couldn't put down my proverbial pen. So many problems, small things, using the conjunctions ""but, yet, though"" inappropriately, and the predictability, poor dialogue- seriously, cops, even fictionalized ones, just don't talk like that. It was stilting.When he writes the horror, writes the ghosts, he shines. It seems writing the straight stuff is difficult for him, and it makes for difficult reading.",0
Great product- recommended for barns and horse lovers: The product is a space saver. We bought 4 of them and put oats and sweet feed in them. The sweet feed is a little difficult to put in because of the texture but if you put a little in at a time then move it back it is well worth the trouble.,1
Amazing!: This book is the best out of the series in my opinion. I read it in 1 day because I couldn't put it down. It's great to see how kids might get along after the Rapture.,1
"Is this guy real?: Dont buy this book, you could get more wisdom from fortune cookie fortunes!This was the most incredibly trite book I have ever read....half of the book is an ancedote focused on Oprah....he writes 5 page acedotes that dont make any sense or tie to any point...it was impossible to read without getting extremely frustrated...it was so bad that of our book club of 8 people only 1 read it all the way through and even though I was the facilitator of the book club meeting featuring this I couldnt even get through it....",0
"Disappointment: My husband bought this for me, but the machine makes really tough and bad tasting popcorn. After 2 uses, the locking tabs on the handle of mine broke off. Very disappointed in this product.",0
"Great for the GoPro HD Hero 2 camera!: Bought the Pelican 1200 for the new GoPro HD Hero2 camera system. I was concerned that it may be too small, but I was able to fit everything I needed in it with foam space to spare: GoPro camera, suction cup mount, head strap mount, roll bar mount, various adhesive mounts, spare battery, larger door for dual battery setup, USB cable and an extra SD card. This case gets strapped to the rack of an ATV and endures water, mud, dust and the occasional rock or tree branch. Water and dirt can not penetrate the heavy duty seal, and everything about this case is high quality. Highly recommend case for protecting your expensive equipment.Best part is, it's made in the USA!!",1
"plodding and tiresome: After all the hype surrounding this book, I was very thankful that I managed to find a relatively new copy at the library. After reading 100 tedious pages I'm happy that I never bought it. I agree with the others who found the story tedious and dull. Patricia Cornwell has nothing to worry about, this story has none of the elements that make her stories good. The characters in this book are annoying and flat. Most offensive is the insipid dialogue between Dr. Brennan and the police, who are mercilessly stereotyped. For someone who reads and understands french, the constant translation of terms is tiresome. The descriptions of Montreal belong in a travel brochure, not in a crime novel. This book has serious weaknessess and I'm surprised that so many people seem to consider it worth five stars.",0
"bike wheels: I ordered these wheels for my bike, and they are superior to the stock wheels, they are heavy duty, much stronger than the originals..",1
"Waste of having Colin Firth in a movie!: I had this movie on my wish list, but then saw it over the weekend and didn't like it. Any movie where Colin Firth is just a supporting role, and misused at that, is a waste of time in my opinion. Uma Thurman is beautiful beyond belief, but the ""lead"" actor (not Firth) is not interesting. Nor is it believable that she'd pick him instead. Not well scripted, either...big disappointment.",0
"We like this one a lot: This is one of the earlier Berenstain Bear books, and it shows. Despite the cover, the bears on the *inside* of this book are less stylized and cutesy than the bears in the newer books. Also, the book is more of an early reader, it rhymes and is nowhere near as wordy as the newer, $4 books. (Tell the truth, I like all these older Berenstains better!)The little bear and his dad go out to get honey, but of course they eschew the honey store *right next to their house* and go on, surprise, a honey hunt.You can already tell that this Will Not End Well. After a series of predictable mishaps, they end up (predictably) buying honey at the store after all, much to the delight of the little ones.This one is a *little* long for toddlers. Save it for the older pre-readers, or the ones learning to read.",1
The guy wasn't perfect which made him a good hero: I picked up this book because of the reviews. I liked it. I liked it a lot. I thought Lexie should have been more up front with her history sooner. But it all took place in a weeks time. A good part was the epilog. The author did a good job letting the two know each other and letting Jack get his life together before stepping into more adventures.Lexie was believable with her innocence and overbearing parents. The author did a good job writing that for us to see. Over all well written. Jack was cool. I like him.,1
"Excellent tasting snack with awesome ingredients!: While these bars take a couple bites to get used to, they taste great and are actually quite a deal for what you get. They have a mild taste that is way better than any other similar bars. If you want something sweeter, try the chocolate raspberry version which are very chocolaty! I'm taking a box of these on my upcoming road trip for quick snacks or even meals to avoid eating out.",1
"The Essential Handy Little Powerhouse Of A Machine!: Anyone who lives in a rural area with spring run off and a high water table can find a thousand uses for one of these. With five very active Labrador Retrievers, my basement floor can get grubby and messy in a hurry, especially when I use it as the main entrance for them during bad weather. This unit will pick up snow, slush, mud, and all the other sorts of organic and inorganic matter with amazing speed, and it is easily and quickly drained and cleaned, as well. This is a powerful machine, yet is fairly quiet in operation. It is sturdy, quite mobile, and packs away in the corner of the basement unobtrusively after using it on the area like the wet and grubby area around the wood stack after bringing more wood in from outside. I've had mine for a couple of seasons now, and it still operates just as if it were new. It is effective, efficient, and well priced. In my opinion, it is a very good buy for the money. Enjoy!",1

"No good: I bought this bone at Petco to help my pup keep cool on hot days. Not only did she chew a hole in it in the first few minutes, but it thaws out very fast and is just a soggy dog toy. Because it doesn't stay frozen long in 80 degree weather, it is easier to chew and tear holes in. I am just glad I bought it at half price and didn't waste a ton of money on it.If you are looking for something cool for your pup you are better off giving it an Ice Cube",0
"Why does she still get published?: Barbara Taylor Bradford's Woman of Substance was so rich, so well written and so immediate, that the author's first effort made us believe everything that followed would be its equal. This, unfortunately, has not happened. In A Sudden Change of Heart, Bradford's characters are so well-off and so shallow in their daily lives that we do not believe they have the capacity to suffer in the midst of terminal illnesses or remembered past sadnesses. Bradford has steadily gone downhill. Finding myself skipping pages that were so predictable, I imagined Bradford really struggling to get through A Sudden Change of Heart simply to meet a deadline. No agent or publisher would even look at a manuscript like this if the author were not already established as the icon, Barbara Taylor Bradford.",0
"Great Cd: The cd came safely.I enjoy this cd from Casting Crowns. It's my first cd from them, and I thought it was quite good. Some of my favorite songs are ""Every Man"", ""Slow Fade"", and ""East from the West"".",1
maquina: muy bien! la maquina es excelente producto! todo el proceso se realizo sin ningún inconveniente! buen precio! recomendado 100% gracias!,1
"Joan Jett Epitomizes SEX!: At first glance, you might think ""Oh great! Yet another compilation disc!"". I thought that too, but being a diehard Joan Jett and the Blackhearts fan I had to add it to my collection. After playing it, you begin to realize that this is not an ordinary compilation. With Fetish and Baby Blue being the only new entries, the others are definitely worthwhile!! What Joan Jett does best is project sex appeal, and this record sums it up! From the controversial ""Star Star"" to the angry ""Coney Island Whitefish"" to the seductively masochistic Fetish, this CD ROCKS HARD! The ONLY thing that kept me from giving it 5 Stars is I know the kickin songs that are yet to be released, and I'm saving it for that!!!",1
"Muszac: While there are a few lovely instrumental interludes on this album, I would have to classify this as ""elevator"" music, with a little too much pan flute for my liking.",0

CRAZY: This is the most real cd that i have come across of in a while. is it so weird that i relate to all but 1 song on this album? ok so there was alot of talk about it seeing that she is the only r&b singer on MURDER INC. But i think Ashanti holds her own.~Bella~!,1
"Unbelievably shallow!: This is by far the worst book, I have read in the past two years or so!(actually, I could not finish it, it was so bad). Mr. Friedman presents a collection of one-line quotations from ""famous"" CEOs, linked together without any discernable analysis.If he does not bring these quotes, he brings examples, of what some companies do, again without analysis!If he does not do either, he explains the obvious, that communication today is easier, than it was 1000 years ago.This was my second attempt (after ""The Lexus and the Olive Tree""), at reading Mr. Friedman's books, but this was surely my last one.",0
City of Angels: One of my favorites. Great soundtrack. I also use several clips to show to my students in my cardiology class!,1
"Madame Alexander: The quality and beauty that you would expect from a MadameAlexander doll. She is dressed with expert care in a stunning gown, her hair groomed to perfection. Every attention to detail is there! Would suggest her for older children that will not take her apart. Not for a 3 year old.",1
"Are you looking for a list?: I'm giving this book four stars because it does do as it says; there are 1001 ways to be romantic. This may be just what you are looking for, a list. If you enjoy getting your information this way, this is the book for you.The reason I didn't give it five stars; some of the items are replayed over with minor changes. Some of it just seems to be filler to reach the 1001 goal. If you are not looking for a big list, this book is probably not for you. Although, if you are a collector of romantic idea books, it's a must have for your collection.",1
"Might have made a funny short story: A few pages of interactions with the angel were funny. Other than that, really not worth the paper it's printed on. I really, really wanted something funny. This wasn't it. Old jokes, sad humor, lots of dull sex and weird violence to make you forget the book is worthless. If that's your thing, go ahead and read it. If you'd like something witty, skip this one.",0
"My ol' faithful...: I love my coffee maker. Hubby is not a coffee drinker so just 1-2 cups I drink per day, this is PERFECT. My daughter had to have one when she left home for college. Maybe I'm lucky (or maybe it'll break tomorrow because I state this...) but I've had mine over 15 years. It gets a daily workout and makes perfect coffee each time. Although the 'fad' is getting a pre-made coffee 'pod' these days, my comparison in price is NOT a drive through coffee shop price so to me, the pods are expensive. I would HIGHLY recommend this coffee maker and it doesn't take up much counter space.",1
"You get what you pay for: I just can't stand being cheap anymore. I'm going to become a dictator in some country and skim billions so I can afford good headphones.These are actually pretty good if you don't want sound quality. They are a step up from ear-plugs. Zero bass response. So don't get them if you are expecting to hear low end. I compared them to my cheap radio shack phones I got a few years ago for around 26 bucks. Wow, now I think the radio shack phones are wonderful.I've got to get another pair--oh yea...no more cheap. Maybe if we stop buying cheap crap; they will stop making it. Hmmm.",0
"False Advertiser: I ordered over 100.00 dollars worth of T shirts from this company and they cancelled my order with the explanationt that the shirts were no longer available or sold out. I look at the site again and the shirts are available only at a higher cost, this is very poor customer service, I am a reliable and frequent Amazon customer and feel offended by this type of bait and switch site.

"Voice vs. vocoder: Cher is back and has never sounded stronger or more confident...that is, when she hasn't been vocoded to the stratosphere. And those moments are few and far between on this disc. But we all knew we were getting Son of Believe anyway. This one is a lot better. Cher is singing in a higher range these days (she said recently she actually went back to the studio to rerecord some of these tunes, because she was singing at too low a pitch). The result: her voice has never been better. And the material is pretty good, certainly better than the Believe tracks; still, the potential for club remixes is almost endless.It's hard to create a dance track with some heart, but Cher does it on Alive Again, Song for the Lonely, Different Kind of Love Song. You Take It All is a nice change of pace. All in all, a fine effort--upbeat, uplifting, up-tempo.",1
"Great addition to the many tools and storage accessories: My husband is a contractor who works full time and then comes home to continue working on our home. I bought this bag as a Christmas gift and it's being well used. It is no longer neat and clean...it's covered in plaster and saw dust but holds up well storing his tools. It's a heavy duty bag with a hard top and plenty of compartments for extra blades, screws, and whatever else a construction guy wants to put in there. I'm sure it would be great for any normal ""Mr. fix it"" as well. The base is better than plastic as it won't scratch wood floors and the shoulder stap makes it eaiser to carry aound.",1
"Does not work with original Cars: My 2 year old son is a huge Cars fan (Lightning McQueen, etc...), so we've been building his collection of Cars. We received this as a gift and were excited to open it, but quickly disappointed when we realized that it would not work with the original Cars that we have been collecting (the kind you can buy at most stores that say ""The World of Cars"" on the package).So, one star for this product. Feels like false advertising to be Cars branded, but then only to work with the two mini-cars that are provided (mini-Lightning and mini-The King).Seems like the company could have designed it to be a little bigger with slightly wider tracks and then all of the original Cars would be able to work on it.By the way, in our experience, we tried some Matchbox cars on it, and they tended to be too long for the track and got stuck.",0
"Best photo paper in the market!: I use nothing but. I don't like the look of ""glossy"" paper. It's just too shinny. This paper gives off a small amount of shine but also reflects some of the looks of ""matte"" paper.I keep 4 x 6, 5 x 7 and 8.5 x 11 in stock at all times.",1
Coffe time: I am using this coffee maker for past 1 month.It has changed my coffee time memorable.this is small compact and so good for my kitchen.my family loves this product.,1
"Blacklight?: These seemed a lot different when I ordered it. It is listed as blacklight reactive, but I didn't see a big difference when placed in a room with only black lights. The colors barely got brighter. I don't know if it was the material or the color or a combination of the two. Also the material is really weird feeling- not exactly what I expected. It was more like a piece of cloth rather than a wall hanging.",0
"Awesome, awesome, awesome: I rarely use that word but this bag was perfect. I wanted to bring my laptop with me on vacation but refused to bring my briefcase. I only wanted it for emergencies, and to download photos from my camera. This case was small, easy to carry, protective for the laptop, and with enough storage space for just the right peripherals AND my beach novel.The fact that it has handles as well as a shoulder strap is a big plus, and I could lean it against the desk without it sliding down to the floor.It looks good as well. This is well worth the premium over other sleeves.",1
"Dude.: Juan. Dude. Chill! This obviously isn't your kind of music, and that's fine. We don't all have to agree on everything.That being said, I can't believe you're condemning this album just because it's different. Music has to evolve, man! If it were up to you, we'd all still be listening to Fats Domino and Chuck Berry. AC/DC didn't just jump out of the ground, you know. You're against progress, man. Don't get me wrong. Your review of Daniel White's Hellstone was right on. You have great taste in books, but your taste in music is a bit dated.I'll bet you think Green Day is another name for March 17.",1
"mindless: I can't reveal key elements of the plot; it doesn't have one.The only saving grace is that it comes to an end, which for mewas less than twenty minutes; thank god for remote control stopbuttons.This movie must have been produced by idiots for more of the same. To like this flick requires that your brain be the sizeof a pea.",0
"Worst Ink Ever!: This completely clogged. No matter how many head cleanings, I can't get anything black to print. It must have congealed or something. Would not buy again. Would strongly suggest to you if you're not planning on using all the ink at once, do not buy this ink.",0
"top of the line: Batteries work great. They charge rapidly and last for the time they are rated for.Yes, I would recommend these batteries to a friend.",1
"Not a vegetarian DHA option.: I am a vegetarian and was looking for a DHA that was animal product free. The product sounded good online being from natural sources and we ordered it. Upon receipt, we were disappointed to find that the first ingredient was gelatin. We immediately returned it. However, it would have been good to know that this product is NOT a vegetarian product to save us time. Marketing needs to do a better job at informing their clients.",0
"Drowning Ruth: Poisonwood Bible and Mother of Pearl lulled me into a false sense of optimism and I had my husband buy Drowning Ruth for me. ""Oprah's Bookclub"" selections usually evoke fear in me. I avoid depressing (she calls them real life) books because most of my early life was lived in a family situation that could be the plot for one her common bookclub choices. I will be much more cautious next time. Drowning Ruth can be described in one word: GRIM!!!!! If you must try it I recommend reserving a library copy. That way you can spend your money on a book that entertains, uplifts, humors or celebrates life. You know, one of those that you just hate to finish!!!",0

"um.....: If this is truly her Autobiography, then her life is pretty sad. I am all for new and fun young pop stars, but she has little musicality. She plays no instruments and writes no songs; hopefully, she will explore trhose areas. The nodes on her vocal chords are incredible and she needs to work on her technique. I liked the song ""Pieces of Me,"" but that was about it. Good luck to her on a new cd!!!!",0

"dont waste your time: the concept is cliched in a bad way and the writimg falls horribly, horribly short of remotey good. reads like something a student would write in highschool; all the characters have seemingly the same voice and personality, (that of the writers, im assuming) and such pesonality is shallow and somwhat blase. i have absolutely no interest in discovering whats happening since the evil dudes plot is revealed in the first few chapters, and the rest of the book is merely a set up for gregarious, bad one liners that all characters deliver equally and without indication that they 're even remotely different from each other. i made the mistake of reading 'on earth as it is in hell' before this and it set the bar high, and set me up for massive dissapointment when i moved on to this book.",0
"Lost Art: This version of Jane Austen's classic, is so far from a well produced drama that it doesn't merit being called drama. Not because of the acting but because the script, directing and sequencing in an attempt to modernize and shorten results in a movie that is difficult to follow, whose characters seem shallow and within a short time, you think to yourself, why am I watching this bollix of a film in the first place. Watch the Amanda Root version, much better, true to the story and a classic that warrants your time!",0
"1 X 3 Does Not Equal Good!: Here's my take on this unfortunate CD: Ms. Fleming's voice is excellent; Mr. Melhdau's piano skills are great; his and other's lyrics are okay. So what's the problem? The problem is that the three do NOT come together. She sings in any way that strikes her fancy, depending on the words, while he plays (strikes the keys) in between, regardless of the effect. This CD is disonnant and disjointed and the least pleasant CD I have purchased in a long time. If I could return it, I would in a flash. I'm surely never going to listen to it again. It's just plain awful!",0
"All the Way to Irrelevant: I've been a hardcore REM fan since 1988. This is easily the band's worst album. The trend over the last three albums seems to have been ""put it all on there, it doesn't matter how long it gets."" Their greatest efforts over their career have run under 45 minutes. The filler on too-long ""New Adventures"" and ""Up"" distracted from what might have been great, cohesive albums. But nothing is saving ""Reveal"". I literally cannot let the CD run past ""Reno."" Why bother? It blows my mind that the band that seemed to be having so much fun playing ""Wolves, Lower"" live on the last tour, and who so recently recorded the terrific ""The Great Beyond,"" would have let this album see the light of day.",0
Great when it's working.: My son was so excited when he received his racing wheel. He had two days of fun. Then it basically quit working. Bolts were dropping out of the bottom of the unit. I would not recommend this particular racing wheel.,0
bad tangled wig: This wig is a one time wear only. Tangles easily. We threw it away after one to two weeks.,0
When God Interrupts: When God Interrupts encouraged me during a major interruption in my own life. I appreciate the Author's insight into this topic.,1
Great!: I got this same exact hair straightener in the summer of 2007 and it has lasted me till January of 2011 almost four years. When most of the hair straighteners last maybe a year tops this line lasts almost 4x longer and to be honest is the best straightener I ever had. I have had the in-styler and this one beats it by a lot. If you need a straightener and you have very thick and wavy hair this is the one for you. The seller got it to me within a couple of days.,1
a poor book for undergraduate and graduate students: this book does not fit into an undergraduate program. it is much to detailed and quite boring for the undergraduate and most graduate students. this book has content but no deliverance for the masses to comprehend.it is a good resource book but a poor text book for the university undergraduate or graduate. jemery,0
"A decent horror flick: I rented this movie after it was recommended to me through the Netflix recommendation system, and for the most part I was very satisfied.Kiefer Sutherland plays an ex cop who becomes confronted by daemons that live in mirrors of a burnt-down New York department store. As they threaten him and his family, he uses all of his detective skills to destroy these sinister forces. The movie is well paced and well acted, with the music score and visuals that greatly enhance the whole experience. The twist ending also makes you rethink many aspects of the movie, which comes as an added bonus.If you are looking for an entertaining horror flick and are not too squeamish about the cutting/dismembering scenes then give this movie a chance. It may not be the most outstanding horror film you'll ever see, but it's certainly worth watching.",1
"A Very Loud Machine: I believe it says: ""Whisper Quiet"" on the box. I guess it's ""whisper quiet"" when I'm three rooms over in the Kitchen with the dishwasher running! Even on the low setting, this humidifier is unbearably loud!",0
"Arrogance Creeps Into Too Many Entries: While this highly detailed volume is valuable for its scope--some 5,000 entries--I found that the arrogance of the author crept into so many entries that the book is more misleading than informative. Therefore, use this book as a spelling guide, and ignore Riddick's constant characterizations of major and minor players in British India. Pity Riddick coiuld not have just given us the information on these personalities without the tawdry editorializing.",0
"Endeavour: Comparing the old Morse to Endeavour is like comparing apples to oranges. You can't, we all loved Morse but I must say this new champ is bloody good his acting is impeccable the scene with him talking about his late mother is unforgettable. Hope for many more of the young Morse.",1
"Best is yet to come: If HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS is taking over the world, then it's the end of life as we know it! I mean this band loses so much of it's great promise by being a group of teenagers gripping & moaning over rock music that life isn't fair or someone hasn't done them right. They could be so much more then they are with A LITTLE MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE behind them. However to whom much is given much is expected. This will be a band to reckon with in about 5-6 years if they can stay fresh and not drop out of sight.With bands like Fall Out Boy that might be hard to do.",0
"Zoom Modem Improves DSL Connectivity: My DSL connection would drop every two to three days using the modem supplied by the service provider (Earthlink).The Zoom modem has greatly reduced this problem. The DSL connection is always up as it should be. While this item costs a little more than the combined modem/router/wireless units I think the extra money is worth it.I found the set up instructions a little confusing, but not a big problem. You could probably hook this up to a router out of the box.FYI, this modem is connected to a Linksys WRT54GS wireless router.",1
"Owned one for years now buying another.: This is a great tool for those who carry one all the time. It is small enough to fit in my jeans pocket, yet big enough to actually get something done. The pliers and scissors combo is handy and all the screwdriver tips work well. The blade isn't bad and holds a edge ok (what can you expect from a knife in this price range). One side of the tool is thicker than the other so at first you might thing it is broken. This is normal and doesn't affect any functions (and saves a little weight).",1
"worst bath ever!: NOt only did the baby slide off of the bath sling the whole time, the bath leaked and the tub pad for the head did not accomodate my baby's head- she kept slipping. This bath made bathtime a horrible experience and I am very sorry that i bought it!!!!!",0
really not that good: Her older songs are much better. This new CD is extremly bad and dull music. Don't buy it if you're a fan.,0
GO FOR THE ORIGINAL CAST!!!!: Why did they have to ruin this show by making this recording? If you are considering buying it- DEFINATELY get original cast. They (for some reason) decided to put the show to a be-bop style and rap a few lyrics here and there. It doesn't suit this wonderful work of art. The female narrator made me want to throw a tennis ball in her mouth to make her shutup! The original male narrator is very good and they should have have never changed it for recent productions. The female is like fingernails on a chalkboard in my opinion. If you are an ALW fan- Joseph is a must for your cd collection but not this recording- skip it!!!!,0
good series bad ending: I loved the whole dragonball series until the last episode of gt i think they should make another series topick up after dbz,1
"Works well for a reasonable price: My local music store wanted over $6 for a recorder swab. Crazy! This swab works great, was reasonably priced and arrived in VERY fast time.",1
"Great!: I originally was skeptical about reading this series because I heard that it was a mixture of fantasy and science fiction, and those aren't my favorite genres. However,when my sister brought it back from the library I decided to try it. I literally couldn't put it down! The story was well written, it was very funny, and it was much better than the average dime-a-dozen fantasy or science fiction novel. I haven't yet read the first two but I will shortly hopefully, along with the later ones too, of course! I wholeheartedly give this book five stars. My only regret is that I didn't read Artemis Fowl and The Arctic Incident first.",1
Great work out.: I thoroughly enjoyed this challenging and fun work out. I like using the bands and the way Kira explains what muscle or area that is being targeted. There are also 3 different work outs that fit any time frame you have available to exercise. It is also easy to adjust your work out to any fitness level. I won't get bored with this workout any time soon!,1
couldnt get it to work: i checked the system requirements like another reveiwer recomended and it said it would work for windows vista which is what we have and it did not my kids were very disappointed they couldnt play it so i dont know what the game is like so it may be great just dont get it if you have vista!,0
"Not for outdoors: I put mine under the hot tub steps, where my dogs couldn't get to it. It worked once, killing a small field mouse. Then I guess the rain got to it, because now it thinks it's got something and won't reset. A rather expensive way to kill a single mouse.",0
"A Book that Really Delivers: Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML is well crafted to give you full insight into how and why these technologies work. In addition it holds your attention with interesting and useful tutorials. I have recommended this book to a number of other people. The Head First & Head Rush series really integrate all of the learning styles into their books to create a better learning experience than most of the classes that I have attended thru high school, college and grad school. GREAT JOB!!!",1
"Cheated!!!: I was supposed to receive 3 ""Free Willy"" movies in a total of two discs but opened the case to find only 1. I cannot help but feel cheated! This is not right especially since my kids were so excited to watch all the featured films in a row.",0
"It's still Billy Joel to me: This collection should receive bonus points for going back and picking up a couple of hits that were left off of the first ""Hits"" package (Innocent Man, Keeping the Faith), but ruins that effort by not getting ALL of his Top 40 hits forgotten the first time around (Honesty, Sometimes a Fantasy). Instead, we are treated to a couple of ""previously unreleased"" tracks. While those are nice, I would rather have had the forgotten tracks (this is a ""Greatest Hits"" collection, remember?). I think that it's some sort of record industry conspiracy that most ""Hits"" collections leave off at least one popular song that you really wish you had, but what can you do? All in all, this is a great way to cap off your Billy Joel collection (if you don't already have all of his other albums) as he retires from Rock and Roll to pursue other musical interests.",1
"Leaky kettle: I liked this kettle well enough, but suddenly it sprang a leak at the base of the handle. This is apparently not unique.",0
"OK, but could be chocolatier: This didn't have a lot of chocolate taste for the recommended serving size. Or the right amount of sweetener. I had to add a spoonful of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder and a few more drops of stevia to get my desired taste. I could have just started with that and left out the fancy product.....",0
"Don't encourage censorship: The censoring of this movie is the real crime. There was no racism to speak of. The fact that it wasn't an all white cast at the time makes it better, but now it truly is an all white cast. I hate censors trying to tell us how to live. KEEP YOUR OPINIONS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE OPINIONS.",0
"Scroll Wheel doesn't work right: Get what you pay for. It's $11 for a reason. The wheel was flawed in the one I used. Oh, you could scroll through documents, if you spun the wheel with your free hand. It didn't matter what the settings in software were, same result. So far MS has made the best mouse I've ever used, the wired Laser Mouse 6000, and the worst, this mouse. Don't buy this mouse.",0
"Definitely not upbeat: In spite of its semi-witty title, and being written in cartoon style, this is not a funny book. The author is very honest, sometimes painfully so, about her reactions to being told she has cancer, how having it affects her relationships with the people in her life, her experience with her treatments, and her thoughts on having cancer in generalThe way she copes is to permenently plant herself in front of the television and become obsessed with TV Guide crossword puzzles. Her utimate conclusion is that knowing you are going to die takes all meaning out of life. Memories and past accomplishements are empty of significance, and there is no point in incurring new experiences.What, she was planning on living for ever? We are all going to die someday and we, some of us, anyway, are bound and determined to make the most of the life we have. As a cancer survivor (so far) myself, I do not recommend this book to anybody looking for humor, hope or cheer.",0
"Best Tea Ever!: I discovered this tea on a trip to Seattle years ago. I was so excited to find it on Amazon so I can keep drinking it. I love iced tea and the flavor of this is out of this world. Also, because it's so naturally sweet, I don't have to use any sugar or artificial sweeteners which I'm trying to avoid. I can't recommend this product highly enough. I'm addicted. You do need to be careful because of the essential oils. I make my iced tea in a glass jar. And, make sure to wash your hands after handling the teabags.",1
"fun but......: OK let me start off by saying i like this cd a LOT- but as i listen to it more and more the songs kind of start to melt into eachother and theres a few of them that i cant really tell apart- sure there are songs like last nite that differ greatly from everything else but teh first two songs just dont sound THAT different- its usually the same chords- i dnno, maybe i just haven't listened to it enough but overall- its a great cd and its worth buying",1
"Offers no hope: This book is so negative. The main message is that the marriage is doomed and that the straight spouse has to suffer while a dysfunctional bi/gay partner makes up his/her mind about where he wants to go. It also offers all sorts of solutions involving sex arrangements with spouses and gay partners - an anathema to most straight spouses. The book convinced me that I must leave my straight wife, because there was no way I could save my marriage. I went as far as putting our house up for sale and making financial arrangements. Then I realized the book was wrong. Over the years I had lost my ability to think with my heart. I had become depressed and used gay sex for comfort. I am trying to save my marriage, no thanks to the book. The book is useful to those couples who maybe didn't have real love there in the first place.",0
"Our #1 for Oregon Collecting (and fun to read too!): We've used GToO for years now and are very happy with this new edition. Index & TOC are well written so the book's easy to use. Five appendices have detailed extra info, web links to some outstanding websites, and clear-to-the-layperson detail on the legalities of what can and cannot be collected which I highly recommend for novice collectors.As someone mentioned, directions can be a bit vague but don't let that stop you - we've always found the sites. In previous editions there was some headscratching and backtracking to find the sites, but author Romaine has added GPS coordinates & better maps, making it much easier.We don't leave on a collecting trip without this in our gear.",1
"Classic: There are so many new pilates plus blends of fitness DVDs available now. I sometimes get caught up in the hunger to get the latest but I always go back to the classics.This is great because it is many levels, though I do feel you should have some experience as a beginner. I am an experienced exerciser and really have to concentrate to make the exercise feel how it is meant to.I do think, if you are serious about pilates you should take a couple live classes to be sure you are doing it right.Then get this one. It is among the best of the pilates DVDs available.",1
"no turning away: saw this film and cannot stop thinking about it. when their son is born with profound multiple disabilities, a young family tries to find a way to cope. told with warmth and humor, for love of julian wormed it's way into my heart and has stayed there since.",1
Disappointed: I bought these Sanuk's for my 11 year old son (first pair) he was so excited when he got them. The comfort is great but on these the front sole has seprated. It has a big gap and I have tried to mend it with glue which lasted one school day. Love the brand but disappointed they fell to pieces so quick -(,0
"excelenteeeeeeeeeeee: la tomo antes y despues de entrenar, el sabor es suave o mejor dicho sin sabor y obvio tiene buena fuente de creatina, senti un leve aumento de fuerza pero quiero terminarme el tarro de 2000grs para ver que tanto aumente de masa y de fuerza.",1
"Starts out slow but finishes with a bang!: Terry Brooks took to long in trying to develop the characters and than when it came down to it they weren't completely developed. But all in all the last four hundred or so pages picked up speed and made up for everything lost in the beginning. The friendship between Shea, Flick, Hendel, Balinor and the Elven Brothers, as well as Allanon was shining true by the time the end of the book came. The mastery of the war scenes were pretty detailed in describing the events. His writing style is a little weird to get used to but it is worth it. My advice: stick through the first three hundred or so pages and you will be in for a treat.",1
"Very good puppy treats!: I am very happy with these puppy treats. I used them on my litter of 10 Golden Retriever puppies and all 10 and the mom likes them a lot. They are a very good size for the pups and also chewy and soft if they are still in the teething stage. Also, if you compare the ingredients in these treats to others, you will find that these are very healthy treats for your dogs/puppies. I will continue to buy these treats for my puppies and the larger ones for my dogs.",1
"Couldn't possibly break a sweat: I bought this DVD because of the overwhelming positive reviews on the site. I did the whole DVD, and didn't break a sweat. Maybe this would be a decent DVD for someone who has literally never exercised in their life, but not for anyone else.",0
Composter: This is the perfect size for my counter. The top seals completely and the filter works to keep any odors from escaping the container.,1
Poor production quality: This video has a poor production quality. A video with kids hold up colors and shapes dancing around. I could have made this video with a home video recorder.,0
Rome Season 1: I never received the video on my IPad or Kindle Fire. Where is it???? I did not think the transaction went through. I purchase multi books online............,0

"Not a good one after all: I love classic guitar.So I tried this one. Unfortunately, this french piece is terrible expect 2 or 3 tracks good.It's so hard to find a good guitar CD!",0
"rourke and everhart steam up the screen: I really like 'Another 9 1/2 Weeks. Sure if you compare it to the original the first gets the upper hand but there's something about it that I througherly enjoy. It has a good soundtrack, interesting and at times moody scenery, Mickey oozes sensuality and sex appeal. But what I find I think that makes the film work is because of the casting of the always gorgeous, talented, interesting, charming, playful-Angie Everhart. I adore Angie, she really is a special lady. There's something fascinating about her. Mickey and Angie have good chemistry together.I recommend at least a viewing of this film if one doesn't own this film already.By Justine Ryan",1
educational reading: I bought this book for school purposes. It was very educational and inspiring. Not what I would by to read for fun.,1
"NOW Foods Peppermint Oil: I have known about the NOW company for years, but this is the first time I have used their peppermint oil. It was originally purchased for a mice problem. I am not sure it if kept all the mice away because the problem involved the basement of the building in which I live, but it also cleared up a sinus infection and it is also good for keeping the bugs at bay, so this is a situation where it was meant to solve one problem and ended up helping me with other problems. My only caution is not to used too much at a time because it is very strong, and of a very good quality.",1
"WTF Happend to BLS?: This CD is by far the worst effort from Zakk Wylde to date. The songs sound very rushed through and poorly written. And his overuse of the talk boxes is quite annoying. It sounds like he is in a huge rut. Time to take a break and focus a little more on your music instead of ""pounding out another album"" every year Zakk.",0
"She knows how to play a violin: This CD, being her first one, is wonderful! The mood of the piece is placed deep into the heart of the young violinist and then is used to play the piece at it's best. Never had I heard such a way to play the piece. I lay awe struck. I've supported her from the beginning when this CD came out and still do today. If you ever have the chance to see her play this piece, or any other, it is like no other musical experience!",1
"Why are the holes so small?: I used this template for my upper cabinets, but it wasn't as easy as it could have been. The holes in the template are so small that neither a drill bit, nor a pencil tip would fit through it to make contact with the door. I had to use an awl (and does everyone have one of these?)and push hard so that I could see the mark, then I had to mark with a pencil or drill.",0
"The Best: This show is hands down the funniest and best-written comedy ever. It's as good as Seinfeld, but totally different from it. It's packed with so many jokes, I still pick up on new things after several viewings. Once you finish watching the season, you'll want to watch it again, and buy the first two seasons if you don't own them already.",1
"LIARS, CHEATERS & THIEVES!!!: THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT, BUT, DO NOT ORDER IT FROM THIS COMPANY. THE PRODUCT PAGE SAID THE AMOUNT WAS FOR 2 TUBES. WHEN I FINALLY RECEIVED THE ONE TUBE AND CONTACTED THE COMPANY, THEY SAID ""THEY WOULD GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY...""...IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS AND MANY E-MAILS LATER AND STILL NO PRODUCT!!!",0
Baha Men -- Write A Deceny Song!: I got the CD for Who Let The dogs Out? Every other song was terrible.,0
"Frustrated: If I had known that I would receive a deflated ball, I would have ordered a different one. No where did I see where it stated the basketball would be sent deflated.Last year I ordered the same little basketball goal, but it got left in the yard when my grandson moved, so I ordered him another one. I also ordered an extra basketball last year, which I was well pleased with and arrived inflated, but Amazon was out of that ball this year, so I ordered this Champion. To me this is the epitome of the lack of customer service.",0
"Common sense branded and packaged as esoteric knowledge.: I was amazed at how a book full of nothing new could be sold as if it contains some secret knowledge that only the initiated could comprehend (you know, like that Kung Fu martial arts stuff...take the pebble grasshopper).What it comes down to is an organized approach to identifying, measuring, and improving business processes. This is something I imagine has been going on long before anyone called it ""Six Sigma"".So, if you must have this book how about cutting the cost of acquisition to three bucks or so plus shipping and get a used copy to see if this is for you.",0
100%Crap: This movie was horrible please don't buy this movie it is so retarted please don't waist your time watching this movie. I really wish I could give this 0 stars.,0
"enduring classic: full of heart, magic and tenderness: magical reminder of how innocence, empathy and love for living creatures enhances the lives of both children and adults -- how much they have to teach us about ourselves and the world. One of my favorite films!",1
Disappointment: I ordered this product but never actually got it. Almost a month after ordering this product they sent me a different one since the acutal one I wanted got damaged or something. Anyway I dont like and never use the one they sent me. I was pretty disappointed.,0
"Spectacular: I've always loved Snow White, but this remastered edition is stunning. The sounds and colors are so rich and vibrant that even my mom (who remembers when Snow White was released in theaters) couldn't remember it being so good. Great for the kids, but even better for those who remember the way it was before.",1
"Great, read it by the ocean, next best to facing one head on: This book not only lets you see what goes on inside the eye of a hurricane but it also lets you look inside the lives of the people on the outer banks. You will experience first hand what it would be like to have to face such a force of nature on the vulnerable strip of land on which they live.",1
"Great Gift !: I was very pleased with the item. I purchased it as a gift for my husband's Birthday. Unfortunately, I had a very limited amount of time to get it. The Video Set was shipped and delivered immediately. My husband loved it and he has been watching it almost every day since he received it. Thanks to Amazon.com I was able to give him exactly what he wanted :)",1
"One of the best hard to find comm. on REV: This was an excellent book by a dispensational, Mennonite author (yes they exist!). There was a great emphasis upon numbers and stats in this book that made it unique. I looked for years for this book until I found it on Amazon. The only drawback is that this book is photocopy of a used copy, so you sometimes see traces of underlining or notes in the margin. Other wise I highly recommend it.",1
"Very unreliable and inconsistant readings: This thermometer is about as good as not having one at all. On one reading it will say 102.7 (which nearly stops your heart) and the next reading (within seconds of the last) will say 95.3 - and the readings continue on like that. Each consecutive reading will have several degrees difference, so you have no idea what the true temperature is.",0
"Not worth the money: We've had this cabinet and some of the coordinating cabinets from the same company for 2 years. After the first 8 months one of the shelves fell down, then, 4 months later, another shelf fell. Since then they have fallen many times. These shelves are heavy and only supported with 4 small pegs near each corner. The back panel keeps getting pushed out since it too is not properly supported and flimsy. We grew tired of emptying the cabinet so we could fix the shelves and fill the cabinet again. We finally screwed in support brackets under the two shelves and they have held up so far. The cabinet does give a clean look to our garage.",0
Poor: Poor sound quality. Too expensive for the lack of quality of the product. Would not buy this brand ever again.,0
Shucks! This book is the best!: I must admit that I was skeptiacal at first when I saw Mr. Wernick's book on this here wesite. But by Job! He done a great job. This is a good'un. I erspeicllay liked the way he explains all the ailements of playin bluegrass. In just three weeks I was playin and hootin and hollerin with the kinfolk. You should just go out and buy this book. You here?,1

"Dissatisfied Consumer: Per my ear doctor's recommendation (with no guarantees), with faith I took Lipoflavonoid supplement for 12 months at 3 pills per day...Needless to say, it cost me a lot of money and the constant ringing/loud hissing noises/pitches in one, then both ears, didn't reduce, let alone diminish; instead they have gotten worse! Due to my frustration et al, I am calling this supplement a HOAX - another one of those snake medicines(?) :/",0
"Admire the Commitment and Accomplishments, but...: What Mortensen accomplished with commitment and perseverance is undoubtly a great humanitarin effort. However, the book is irritating to read. Mortensen's name is used so many times over and over it is distracting. ""Mortensen this"" and ""Mortensen that""! It reads like Mortiensen is a demi-god and it really presents like this when you realize he is a coauthor. Why not write this inspiring story in ""first person""?The humanitarian effort is inspiring if you can get through the book!",0
"Jazz Lover: OUCH! My Ears! I knew it would be bad, but, WOW! Frank Stallone has butchered some of the best Jazz standards as well as embarassing some good musicians that were trying to hide his tone deafness. Almost mediocre, at best.",0
"Good product: These punches are good for what I use them for, ar 15 assembly. The yellow paint cracks off the top easily when hammering them but that's to be expected since a hammer is smacking it.",1
"Why not letterbox?: I have always enjoyed this film. Only the original Muppet Movie is better. But, the DVD of the Muppet Movie is far superior. Why? The film is letterbox!! Who ever thought of putting this film out nonletterbox should rethink what they are doing.",1
"no visual: In listening to this disc, about half dozen times. I realized one thing. TH's Stage antics, definitely made him win AI. This CD is okay, almost sounding a bit karaoke at times. First Single Runaround was not the correct choice, imho. I really wa slooking forward to this cd (as well as Daughtry's). I keep listening, hoping to like it more, but honestly, I can't see myself picking this cd out of my collection in a few months, and saying ""oh I haven't heard that in a while."" He should have looked at someone like MArc Broussard for inspiration. His voice is suited for cajun style blues pop.Good luck next time TH, you deserve better than this cd.",0
"Great! Thrilling!: It was phenomenal! This was a capturing, action filled video. It shows real stories and real videos of what happened. Buy it today!!!",1
it does what it promises.: Nice. Holds my ML shaped guitar nicely. I can't say anything bad about it. It's a good product at a good price.,1

"George Alexander Strikes Again!!!: I bought what must have been the first volume of Mr. Phd's series on samurai and was enraged at the incredibly low quality of the documentary. Judging from most of the reviews that I've read of this one, he hasn't improved. I figure the 2 positive reviews were either written by Mr. Alexander himself, or his mom, or possibly his nephew. This guy must be stopped. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING THAT HE IS EVEN REMOTELY ASSOCIATED WITH!!!",0
Just okay...: I use this slicer for making Raw meals and it slices much thicker than a less expensive spiraler that I already own... It's not what I expected.,0
"What's a Girl Like You Doing In a Book Like This?: Not for the squeamish and definitely not for the puritanical, Chameleon is chock full of the innovative and outlandish sketches by this master of modern (ie post-Alien) character design. This book is devoted completely to Nirasawa's female characters including his famous Ninas, ranging from the surreal to the grotesque. Doe-eyed, enormously endowed, sexually charged without being obscene (well, to some of us at least), Nirasawa shows off scores of cyborgs and monsteresses, each one bolder, more spontaneous, more bizarre than the last, and packed with more humor and paradox than the work of any Western character designer that I can think of. If you're a student or simply a fan of concept character design, Nirasawa's work belongs on your bookshelf along with your Frazettas, Barlowes and Gigers.",1
"Heavily overlooked concept: Once upon a time in the early 80's this album was available in the U.S., but was discontinued. It is pretty much a concept of the rock and roll lifestyle, and what a cd it is. If you like that AOR sound of the early 80's this is for you. The big hit of this album was the song My Girl with it's awsome vocals. It's one of those songs you might not recognize by title, but once you hear it you'll say ""I remember that!"". Great, refreshing cd overall. Has a few surprisingly heavy guitar songs on it. Give it a chance.",1
"Miserable product: Got this in the mail and tried it out on my Mac Book. The remote is very cheaply built and feels as if it will disentegrate in your hand at any moment. Poor button feedback so it is hard to tell if you have adequately pushed the button. It didn't work porperly out of the box with Keynote. Soooooo I downloaded the updated driver and it still stunk. The remote had unpredictable behavior when advancing or rewinding slides. Sometimes it would just trigger a blank screen without any build, other times it would jump to the end (and no, I wasn't holding the button down for 0.5 sec to go to the end of the show). I had it boxed back up and returned to Amazon within 10 minutes of opening it. Avoid this product, it doesn't work as advertised.",0
"Boy, you can tell that there's no Jim Henson: Everything done by the Muppets since the death of Jim Henson has been sorely lacking in heart. This production had promise but it never got beyond that. Even Paul Williams' music seems to be lacking without the collaborative genius of Henson.There are a few chuckles here and there--brought about mostly by the newish character of PePe the Prawn--but I'd have to guess that Henson wouldn't be proud of this effort.And what's weirdest to me is that ALL of the Muppet's voices seem to have changed--not just Kermit's, who obviously sounds different these days since he isn't being performed by Henson. Fozzie sounds different, Miss Piggy sounds different, Gonzo sounds different, Scooter sounds different...and longtime Muppet fans will know it.Just a disappointment overall and the last post-Henson Muppet production that I'll spend my money on.",0
"Yuck.: Lee Child started out with some pretty fine novels in his series featuring the ex-military cop, now drifter Jack Reacher. Reacher seems to have a penchant for landing in some rather outlandish and bizarre situations. Unfortunately, Child lost his touch in this one. ECHO BURNING is a slow, drawn out, and rather boring novel. While RUNNING BLIND, his last novel, was a terribly unbelievable and contrived plot - at least there was plenty of swift, moving action that kept the pages turning. Here we get long, unnecessarily detailed descriptions of Reacher sleeping, Reacher driving in a car, the melodrama of a six year old trying to figure out how to open a locked door. This reader kept saying ""let's get on with it already!!""This was a rather slow and disappointing story.",0
"above average: I have had mixed feelings about this one. In parts I wanted to lose myself; at others I got exasperated. Better editing could have resulted in a better and more fluent story. It is exotic in parts. U can feel a different land and its strange people who are different from us westerners. However like I said, this is definitely not among the best books I have read but still above average.",0
Fantastic Debut Album: This is a great debut album from Justin Guarini. I love every song on the CD. If RCA had promoted this album properly then it would be multi-paltinum by now and Justin Guarini would be a huge star. I hope Justin's new record label properly promotes his Jazz CD.,1
"This Product works great!!!: This product works like a dream. I needed a memory expantion for my pda, i just popped this card in and my memory was instantly 10mb rather than my previous 2mb. I would reccomend this product to anybody who owns a handspring visor and is in need of a memory expantion. It is also priced very fairly. At just 39.99 it is way worth the money.",1
Didn't work with my 1080p monitor: When I used this cable to connect my Dell Latitude E6410 to aViewsonic VA2231WM-LED 22-Inch Widescreen LED Monitor1080p monitor I got severe flickering and discoloration--a totally unusable picture. The monitor/laptop combo works fine with other VGA cables.When I used this cable to connect to a monitor at 1440x900 it worked fine. I think the quality just isn't high enough for the bandwidth needed for 1080p.,0
"Change the way people looked at Tv: Season One of Buffy captured the interest of its viewer within the first few episodes. Its clean brake away from its earlier movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer, landed this hit TV show among the greatest. I highly recomend you buy it so you can see for your self how Joss Whedon took a simple thought and created a masterpiece.",1
"Disappointed: I bought this even with all the bad reviews about the top. I thought for such a good price ($16) I would just replace the plastic perk top from the get go with a glass one. Well, this one is not made so that the perk top can be unscrewed; it has to be broken off of the top. Also, the hole it leaves in the top is too small for the ""fitz-all"" replacement perk tops. Guess I'll use it awhile only while watching it, and if the plastic breaks I'll just ream out the hole to be able to get a replacement glass perk top into it. It does look very nice but, like all the new percolator manufacturers, they seem to be concerned only with making a pot of coffee FAST rather than really brewing the coffee. That's why the new ones are 1000 watts. I prefer the old 450 watt percolators that really brew the coffee for 15-20 minutes. Anyway, that's my take on this product.",0
The best of the new singers to date!!!!: Michael Buble has every thing it takes to be a star....a beautiful voice and good looks. He is also very personable with his fans/audience at his concerts. He is number one on my list!!!!,1
"ELP Deluxe Edition: I love this band and am looking forward to the release of the rest. However, I'm having a problem with the 3rd disc, the 5.1 DVD Audio/SACD tracks. My Pioneer DVD AUDIO player will not play the thing. I have gotten 2 copies of the set from Amazon and they both are turning the player off when I put the disc in. The 2 CD's play just fine. The owner's manual for the player states that if this occurs, the disc was illegally copied. But it's not a copy...Has anyone else seen this? I'm keeping my second copy, but I hope this problem does not occur with any others...???",1
"Don't Even Bother: This video is no good at all. Fortunately for me, I rented this tape and did not purchase it. The info contained within is very little and provides nothing new at all. The re-enactments are laughable. Please don't waste your time or money.",0
"Cult Fiction? Yeh, right.: I admit to being conned by the ""Cult Fiction' tag on the DVD cover. The movie is almost laughably bad. The plot has potential but it is not realised because of the terrible miscasting - eg the second in charge of the gang looks and acts like a junior university lecturer - the bad and inconsistent acting - Helen Mirren and Bob Hoskins seem to be in different movies most of the time - and the punishingly slow pace. It comes close to the 'so bad it's good' category.",0
"This book must be made into a play or a movie: I read this book when I was in the eighth grade and a few years ago I reread it. Both times I was enthralled. This book is a real page turner and has such atmosphere! I have been thinking about adapting it for stage for a children's theatre. Being a massachusetts native, I have a real appreciation for the setting of this book. All the characters are so well written and the plot just keeps you guessing until the very end. I wonder is Mrs. Carleton is still alive and if so, knows just how much impact this book has on its readers.",1
"What was that????: Tom Robbins has many good thoughts, but does not know how to tell a story. On the one hand, I was very interested in what was happening to the Princess, her family, and Woodpecker. On the other hand, I was trying to wade through all his ""chatter"". I enjoyed a little of the ""chatter"" but I think he could have told the story in about half the pages. And in those few pages, he still could have addressed what makes love stay, the camel pack and much more. I would recommend an abridged version of this book.",0
"I love this song!: This is the best song, eminem and dre. sound great together. This song is like my anthem! The song has a great beat. Everyone shoud buy this cd!",1

"Not funny: I got this thinking that he could bring some of his comedy from the ""Chappelle Show"" to his stand up, and agonized to finish watching it. He spent the first 10 minutes saying, ""I will not apologize."" I guess he knew he wasn't funny and wanted to let you know before you watched. His jokes were not funny, and when he did the Rick James vs. Charley Murphy bit, it came across as a reach. Do not buy, rent, or waste your time watching this.",0
"I was very disappointed: I am a Stephen King fan of old, and Insomnia is the only book of his I have ever read that I had to wade through. It started off really well, then lost me after page 100 or so. I spoke with another friend who simply stopped reading it and never finished it. I must say though that he thoroughly redeemed himself (not that he really needed redemption) with Desperation. He still is and will remain my favourite author.",0
"Ok Vacuum & Great value: I was looking for a new vacuum at a reasonable price and this one caught my eye. Bagless or bagged, light, on/off switch for brush, attachements, and even a turbo brush. It has everything I need so I checked out the reviews. Almost everyone gave it a poor rating and I can see why. It is cheaply made and is OK for picking up on a hard floor but the price floored me. $69 and free shipping! If I had paid what the other reviewers had paid, I'd be disappointed and upset also. I'm giving it 4 stars for the value and the fact that you couldn't buy a vacuum with all these features at that price. So far over the last few months it has been fine. If it lasts a year I'll be tickled!Update: It's over 3 years and the vacuum is still working fine. The only drawback is that it should be emptied and cleaned after every 1-3 uses depending on how full it is.",1
"Won't play on my Onkyo Blu-ray.: I love the movie on my DVD & was looking forward to the HD improvements, but it wouldn't play beyond the WB opening logo. I had to return it.I hope they fix it soon.",0
"Sony DVP-CX 995V failure. No Disc!: This item is very unreliable. Sony offered a HDMI disc to activate the feature and after activation the unit failed. Sony refuses the repair. This is already the second unit I used and failed. The common failure is indicated by: Won't play disc, any discv. The unit is virtually worthless and no one will repair it. The failure is software related and only Sony must fix it.Who buys it is a fool! Also overpriced!",0
"Sometimes Less Is More!: What a refreshing project! Like most things, good design is simple design! dwightyoakumacoustic.net is the most exiciting CD/album since Don Leady and the boys released ""The Tailgators"" ""Swamp Rock"" back in 1986! If you like Dwight Yoakum, Country music, bluegrass or rock-a-billy even a little bit, you need this CD, minimalistic in it's packaging, the tracks are full of passion and energy, that most of todays artist could learn from. This project reminds me why I like Dwight Yoakum's music, heck he's an incredible songwriter! So put it on and sing along!",1
"Awesome: This game is awesome. It is a game with pointless mini games. Dont get me wrong i love this game and all its pointless (but fun) minigames or a.k.a microgames (called that in the game). I mean Nintendo DSers this game is one of the first games that uses the microphone. How sick is that. I love this game. It is 100% better then that stupid game feel the magic. It is probably the best game i have. I have a lot of games (Madden2005, SuperMario64 DS, Urbs, and Spiderman 2), but this game is probably the best of all. I mean eating a doeghnut, Scracthing a back, popping baloons, and my favorite ( or atleast 1 of them because they r all awesome) rolling down toilet paper untill all of it runs out r only some of the most awesome games this game. Like i said before this game is awesome.",1
"Waste of Money: This doll is a total disappointment, especially for the cost. It's difficult, if not impossible, to correctly program. We just can't get the doll past January to set my daughter's birth date. There seem to be a lot of glitches. I would NOT recommend this doll, even though my 7-year-old wanted it very much. She is getting frustrated with the doll's commands. It's a total waste of money. DON'T BUY THIS!",0
"Not Worth A Dollar: I have been using Final Draft since version 4. After endless crashes of version 6 on my Mac, I finally upgraded to version 7. Although I haven't had the classic v.6 total wipeout crash (where you can't even open the last saved version of your file or it opens blank), today I had a nice surprise where the scene numbering dropped down into the action. Not wanting to do a scene re-number I was forced to go to an earlier auto save version. AUTO SAVE OFTEN!I was too slow to return this version or I'd me on Movie Magic already. No updates that mean anything the entire time I've used FD, and with 7 they screwed up the Navigator, a feature I actually liked! I won't even get into the hopeless lack of keyboard shortcuts and cheesy incomplete porting to Mac.Don't waste your money! FD6 is out there for ""evaluation,"" and you won't need activation.",0

la antorcha encendida: que triste que televisa tenga esta clase de novelas en las q hay tantos actores tan maravillosos y preparados pero q al final una novela de esta calidad quede inconclusa una verguenza de verdad ojala pudiera recuperar mi dinero no vale la pena ver algo asi si al final de invertir horas viendola y aprendiendo de nuestra historia no se concluye el tema no volvere a ordenar nada de novelas producidas por televisa porqueria.,0
"No No No Yeah Yeah Yeahs: It's not my intention to write a review here and have it be completely ripped to smithereens. I just think that with a single out as creative and flowy (and as ""Pretenders-esque"") as Maps, the whole CD should've reflected that. The rest of the CD is just screaming and unsettling. And I am a fan of punk rock. I was surprised that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are categorized with The Strokes and The White Stripes. Maybe they just need some more practice? This CD is a perfect example of a one-hit-wonder.If you're considering buying the CD after hearing Maps, listen to a some of their other stuff before you buy it. If I could take it back to the store, I would. I'd have been just as happy buying Maps for 99 cents off of the Apple mp3 store.",0
"Shallow melodrama: I found almost nothing about this book convincing: the characters were largely stereotypical and the author's lessons seemed calculated to appeal to a mass audience, rather than based on any honest, life-earned wisdom. Phrases like, ""Every life has one true-love snapshot"" may strike us as sweet, but they are neither wise nor true.",0
"Mostly Common Sense: I really didn't find anything too helpful in here. Most of the information was common sense or for people who really don't have a clue how to run a therapy session. If you just go to a session or two as a patient (instead of a therapist), you will have this book down.",0
"Love the 1980 set: There are two concerts here: the one from 1974 is a bit more loose than the later one. If you've seen Van a few times over the years, you know that some nights there's no one like him; other nights he's more human than divine. You'll have both experiences here, but at the price and quality of the recording, it's worth picking up.",1
"Not for the ameteur: Total emphasis on artsy manipulation of images. No practical use for someone just getting started. Maybe for a pro with an established business, models, and clients this book can provide inspiration but for a private individual this book is of absolutely no value.",0
"Great short workout, gets you sweating: I bought this and Ripped in 30. This video is less intense than the ripped in 30 but is by no means easy. You have to push through it and give it your all and you will lose weight. If you combine this with Jillians diet plan completely worth the money. It does not feel like your on a diet and you never feel hungry. The recipes are so delicious and it helps you stay healthy to have better weight loss results. I alternate this video with ripped in 30 to get a variation on exercise routines but you can not go wrong with either video. Thanks for a great 25 minute workout. You do need to warm up before you start the video since she doesn't take enough time to stretch and warm up.",1
"Execellent, [Affordable] and really teaches calculus: This book doesn't have all those eye catching color visuals, but what makes this book great is its content and way of explaining concepts of calculus. There's a lot of reading which might seem cumbersome at first glance, but ultimately it's worth every second spent on reading. In many calculus book I've seen, there's a theorem, proof of theorem sometime, few examples and then exercise. This book more emphasizes more on discussing theorems and different concepts, proofs of theorems and why, how they work. The book is not very rich in examples, but once you get the concept, you'll be able to do any example. Also the examples that are given, explained thoroughly. So except for the quantity of examples, I have nothing else to complain. Thanks to Doverpublications for making such book affordable ...",1
"great action!: It is very refreshing to have a new character in the series. Kurt Austin is younger and not nearly as cynical as Pitt. This was a great action book, but at times I get tired of how ruthless the antagonist is. In all his book they always seem to be without emotions or humanity.",1
"best laptop I ever had: I have to say at the outset that I am not a gamer nor a techie, thus I cannot comment on this laptop's ability to handle comple graphics, etc. I just need a reliable, light, and good looking notebook. I have had prior laptops including HP, Toshiba and Dell. This Sony wins hands down.",1
"unfortunate problem release: I agree with some other viewers on the aspect ratio. It's an annoying viewing experience since it's quite apparent that the top and bottom of the picture is being cut off. Numerous scenes have part of the person's head cut off, or even worse, the woman's cleavage is cut off from the bottom of the screen. The clarity is perfect, but is not enough to salvage this problematic release. Too bad, try again - perhaps.",0

"OOOH it's soo lovely: I love the new album, yes it's a bit sadder than their other albums but it is soo damn lovely to listen to.I just love Andy Bell's gentle vocals on these tracks his voice is one of the best in the buisness. It's the kind of album that despite the sadder tone still makes you smile and sway around the living room.Worth paying full price I'm soo happy they're back, and hopefully there will be more to come.",1
"Not even close to Name of the Rose: I've long searched for another Name of the Rose, and thought I'd finally found it with IFP. WHAT a disappointment. A rambling mess that I could not finish. Not only did I not care about the victims and why they died,the characters are uninteresting and disconnected with times. Pears just isn't much of a storyteller, the reader continually waits for something to happen. He would have been better off cutting the book in half. I found little to recommend, and I'm taken aback by its positive reviews.I finished ""Name"" with a great feel for the times, the personalities of the people, how, and what, they thought about the world around them, and profound sense of history. Propelled along by a terrific mystery and compellng protagonists and you have a great book. Pears does not deliver any of this.",0
"A lie told by a little boy weighs heavy on his mind.: I am an elementary school teacher and this is one of my favorite stories. A must have for every library. Not only is it entertaining, but it has an important message for children. The kids love this book!",1
"It's coo: I liked it really, when we rented it I was like "" I'm not going to watch it, no way."" Then I watched for 5 seconds and couldn't stop watching it. It's interesting, not action-packed, it's humorous (not cracking up funny.) My type of of movie. (-:",1

"""defintely a five"": This book is so fascinating I can't put it down. It's been well researched as one can see from the bibliography at the end, and I feel I'm learning so much about one African country's tragic history, something they never told us about in school. I like one reader's comparison to the Mosquito Coast; the family power structure is very similar, as well as the white Americans' naivete and total unpreparedness for what they find.I'm almost at the end and find I dont want to let it go either. The characters (except for the father) have done so much growing throughout, and the plot never lacks for action. On a scale of 1-5, I'd give this a 6.",1
"Old and Dangerous: I will not purchase these blades ever again. Upon receiving, I noticed that the packaging was slightly faded and when you open up the actual blades, the gel coating (the strip of green/blue) had actually MELTED on some parts of the blades. This concludes that the storage facility of these products are not the best of conditions, which will harm the performance of the actual blades against your hair.It gave me cuts and provided a more intense sting on the facial skin than blades usually do.Avoid.",0

It took a little time to get use to the lack of a physical book and pages, but its very comfortable (more so than a book) to read lying down, or on your side or whatever. Very easy to navigate. Overall I am glad I made the switch.",1
"Cowardly Ghost!: I saw this black & white movie Canterville Ghost(1944) years ago. The cowardly ghost was funny. I was excited to find it on Amazon. The ghost tries to scare the guest instead they scare the cowardly ghost. Once again I enjoyed watching it but it wasn't as funny as I remembered. I also purchased the newer version in color of Canterville Ghost(1986)staring John Gielgud, Ted Wass, Andrea Marcovicci, and Alyssa Milano. This Canterville ghost wants the new owners out and is very mischief. We enjoyed both movies.",1
"NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC DINOSAURS: National Geograpic Dinosaurs by Paul Barrett was an excellent book. It was written for both kids and old folks like myself. The book outlines all the different types of dinosaurs (except Spinosaurous-unfortunately)- a dinosaurs that dominated the movie Jurassic Park 3. Dinosaur lovers will love this book, the subject matter, the descriptions and colored photos, and the required detail of each dinosaur type.

Number 9 ranks number 1 but don't get me wrong, number 8 is still great, and as is number 7.For the storyline of Number VIII, out of 10 I rank it a 8--the graphics, 7 out of 10--characters, 8.5 out of 10, difficulty, 7.5, gameplay, 9, and overall satisfication and entertaiment--10 out of 10.This game will grip you and won't let go.

"Minnesota Lutheran It Is Not: As a Minnesotan, I am proud of Light from Heaven, a compilation introduced to us by Minnesota Public Radio. If you would dismiss this as mere chauvinism because two of the musicians are well-known on the local musical scene, I wish to lay such suspicions aside. MPR follows a tradition of challenging its listeners with the unique and beautiful, but replays those recordings only upon popular demand.Sit back, listen to this CD a few times and find peace resonating in your soul (as promised in the liner notes). You may find the roots of Celtic music in some of these pieces. You may find understanding, the opening of doors, the meeting of minds. You may also see a sign of music's significant power to unify. For years, oriental musicians have excelled in playing western music; it is a joy to find western musicians at the feet of oriental masters, then offering us insight into the glories of such a rich culture.",1
"Bliss-My #1 pick of 2000!: What a welcomed change, the song Winding Road - with its rippling melody, acoustic guitar and mood provoking lyrics is so relaxing. The song calling is delivered with such emotion that it felt like it was written just for me and my man. My other favorite is the song ON. I kept playing it ""on and on."" I grew up in the 70's and this song reminds me of the ones I danced to, but with a new edge. A great addition to my collection for 2000!",1
"LOVE this stuff !!!: I was skeptical about using a Silicone Lubricant as I had always used water-based types. I/We LOVE this stuff, it is so slick, not sticky AT ALL and meets all of our lubricant needs.",1
"Not great for use to seal liquids: I was excited to try these based on the reviews. I sure was disappointed. I bought these to seal liquids in a bag because they claim to have an ""Air- and watertight seal keeps food fresh"". Any pressure on the bag and the liquid comes out. If they were truly watertight, this wouldn't happen. I am giving these a 2 star because if I can apply slight pressure to the bag and water comes out, it is neither air nor water tight and I don't like to say I hate things. I wish I would have tested the liquid seal before trimming some of them down to the size I needed. If I had done so, these would be going back.To summarize, if you need these for sealing in liquids, you might want to look elsewhere.",0
"Too tight for a bigger hallux (big toe).: I bought this item because I injured my big toe by dropping a mirror on it. My nail is damaged, black and painful. However, this toe cap is so tight that my toe started bleeding again as soon as I rolled it over the toe. It may be good for a little finger (pinky), but way too tight for a big toe, which is displayed in the picture. I do have a larger sized big toe though, so it may work for you if you have a smaller big toe.",0

"Fun, light read: I read ""There's Cake in my Future"" and really enjoyed Kim Gruenenfelder's voice, so I decided to give this a shot. It's a fun, light chick-lit read. Charlie is a little neurotic (in a very relatable way), her friends are fun, and her boss is Crazy. Overall, this book was fun; fun enough I started the sequel as soon as I finished this",1
Sublime Guitar: In choosing music for my play I came across this remarkable guitarist. His fingering is superb and the music will make you think and/or dream. Truly a premier artist. And I get to hear him in person in a few months. For you others poise your fingers to get a CD of one of his albums. Doesn't matter which one but this one has wonderful songs.,1

My wife says my eyes look worse, more puffy, but I can't tell one way or the other since it was her idea to buy this because I never really paid much attention or cared. I'll keep using it until it's gone. Who knows maybe a miracle will happen by the time I get to the end of the bottle, but I sort of doubt this.An interesting aside...a friend told me he has been using Preparation H for years to reduce the puffiness under his eyes and he swears by it.

"A Must Read for the German-American Cold War Experiences: ""GIs and Frauleins"" presents a comprehensive review of the cultural and economic impact the massive American military machine imposed on a small, agrarian, and relatively poor German state at the peak of the Cold War. This book presents a seminal work for the comprehension of later cultural clashes that dominated both the United States and Germany and continue to the present.I recommend it for both the serious scholar as well as the casual reader of social and demographic history.",1
funny: This is a classic in comedies. I have always enjoyed this one and you will to. It is a movie that the whole family can watch and watch again and always get a laugh from it.,1
Definately police only: I actually bought this book because one of the descriptions I saw said something about military and spec ops trainers as well. The author apparently was in the military but the book has little if any application for our needs. So if you are looking for somthing to suppliment your MOUT training this book is not it.,0
"Fashion diva becomes a Grecian goddess: This is one of the best dolls in this excellent series. With her upswept hair, vampish eye makeup and draped gown she is one of the most glamorous Barbies to come out recently. The back of the box shows a prototype doll using a standard Barbie head sculpt, fortunately this doll was actually produced using the Lea/Kayla head sculpt which is clearly a better choice. The only fault I can find with this doll is the fact that her dress is sewn on so if you plan on redressing her you will have to carefully undo the stitching, this doesn't ruin the dress but is a nuicance considering that it could have easily been made with snaps. Other than my one objection, and if you plan on leaving her as is this won't be a problem, I do think this doll is an outstanding value.",1
"Amazing Grater: This is an amazing piece of kitchen equipment! After years of shaving off my fingernails or fingertips using different graters, or having them slip off the plate I'm grating onto... this is truly a pleasure to behold (and to be held!) The triangular design along with the little rubber feet make it incredibly stable while grating anything from cheddar to ginger to chocolate. The knob is big enough to be comfortable without cramping your hand... and all it really takes is just a bit of pressing down from the top to keep it steady. I gave these as Christmas presents, and got rave reviews!",1
"Not enough space to journal: This book gives a column for each week and a grid map for each month and that is all. There is no space alloted for email addresses, nursery listings, plans, etc. Despite being spiral bound, the book will not bend enough to make it comfortable to write on the left side. It does give plenty of information, but it is really a gardening book not a gardening journal. Those of us who make copious notes are out of luck. A cheap notebook from the grocery store would have been better.",0

"Get a Timex: Wasn't what I expected. I had purchased this to replace my usable, yet wearing down Timex Ironman. It doesn't have half the functionality of my Ironman, and costs about 20-30 dollars more. Unless you like fancy watches, or only use a watch to tell time(Yeah, I know how it sounds.), I suggest getting something else. I use my watch for a lot more than just the time, so that's mostly why I gave this a bad review. Returned and am still using my Timex Ironman.",0
"Great little potty: This has been a great little potty to keep in the car for my daughter who wasn't ready for ""big potties"" yet. I loved that it is small and one-piece. Even though she only used it for a few weeks, it was well worth it, especially since we were on vacation for 10 days. I still keep it in the car for emergency potty needs.",1
"Water Sports Stream Machine: This is useful only if you have a swimming pool. I thought it would be like a squirt gun that I could aim at invading dogs chasing my cats. Not a chance. It's basically a plastic tube inside a plastic tube that sucks up water and expels it in a single, garden-hose-like stream. It was not something that met my needs. It's probably indestructible though.",0
learning endgames can be fun: soltis uses the socratic method to teach you how to think during the endgame. i usually find it boring to study endings so i never really did it. soltis makes studying endgames enjoyable and he slips in a lot of practical advice.,1
"Weird humor from the 70s: This is a strange little book sold by student book club type plans when I was a kid. I remember it very well and still laugh over jokes such as ""Wild Cheese Plants are not actually plants. Nor do they grow in the wild. Nor do they have anything to do with cheese. They are actually a type of shoe.""I don't know how many other people read this or remember it at all, but I loved it and still think it's corny and funny.",1

"defective DVD: I am a huge Columbo fan, however, I was most disappointed at the quality of the 3rd Season DVD set. The first film kept pausing and playing, pausing and playing. It's most annoying and ruins the viewing experience. Upon closer inspection I find there is a manufacturing error. The oil used to produce the DVDs has obviously not settled well and thus not produced the DVDs to the quality that is required.I have now asked for an exchange hoping that I'll get one from a decent batch, failing that I will return it again for a full refund.",0
"Gotta Love This!: This is a magnificent idea source for decorating a child's room. Everything is in color and what colors they are, too! There are one to three pictures per page. All ages of children's rooms are represented and they even have a small section on children's bathrooms. I first saw a library copy, but fell in love with the book so much that I decided to buy one for me. I'm a librarian and this is the nicest book I've ever seen on the topic. Happy reading and looking.",0
"Horrifying Failure: Flick is almost unwatchable for someone with an appreciation of acting and a sense of screenwriting and history. Zweig would have been better off by hitting the archives himself and not just relying on the faulty Girard letters and his amateur psychology. Shearer is plain unbearable with her constant sobbing and shrugging. It's painful to watch her at 35 trying to play a 14 year-old girl. Spending 3m and not shooting in Technicolor was another huge mistake MGM made. And it's really great to see Louis XVI and the ""mob"" both portrayed as retards. Thanks, Hollywood, now the French Revolution finally makes sense.",0
"Some what Dissapointed: I have owned this drum sander for about 2 years now and had tremendous problem the 1st week of owning it tring to get the table adjusted level and skippping teeth on the flimsy belt. After a couple of days of adjusting I finaly got it working good and have used it on average about 3 hours a week. It seems to work better (the height adjustment) on warm days, what doesent though. I almost through this thing in the trash today as it skipped a couple of teeth for the 1st time in over a year and spent the next 2 hours readjusting the table so the height adjustment would turn easily. As soon as I can afford it I will be selling this thing and buying another peice of crap from China.",1
"Disappointed: Very disappointed with these scissors. I had them for only one week and used them 3 times to cut paper and noticed they were cutting funny. As I was holding the scissors up to look at the blade to see if it was bent or something, I squeezed the scissors and one of the blades came off. It looked like it just snapped off clean where the blade inserts into the handle. Not fixable.",0
"trip & wayponit manager CD Ver.5: the Garmin trip & waypoint manager program is a extremely basic map of major roads and a couple other things ( airports , etc ). It has no detail of any kind to it and is completely worthless as a outdoor person's mapping program for hiking , trapping, etc, etc, ...... It shows no terrain or contour markings or elevations and or many other details. Garmin would do well to discontinue it, get out of the mapping market and make their units compatible/usable with the better topo map companies on the market. A paper map from a store is of more value than the T&W program is, for finding your way over roads. Garmin seems to be ""Losing their way"" in the market place, their instructions manuals suck and lack detailed info on their GPS units. they seem to be more concerned with adding useless, fancy apps and software to their GPS units.",0
"A MUST OWN VIDEO!: This is definitely one to buy, watch, and own. I personally make it a note to watch it every six months. Before you spend all that time taking martial arts classes do yourself a favor and buy this video instead. It's really effective. You will learn a lot on this subject.",1
"A familiar but not-familiar tale.: This children's book is a story similar to the classic ""Red-Riding Hood"" story except that it is based an a folktale from China. A mother has to leave her three children in a house and a wolf tries to take advantage but the children are able to use their wits. The book won the 1990 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children and it is beautifully illustrated.",1
"Ideal Hub to eliminate Laptop USB Spaghetti Syndrome: Who needs a docking station when you have this great 7-port hub? Setup is a snap. The power cord and the USB cord to the laptop is long enough to keep the mess of add-on USB cables and devices far away from your laptop. As mentioned above, the power adapter doesn't take up more than one socket on your powerstrip. It's not only compact but a nice rectangular square design to place portrait or landscape on your desk. Sounds like a simple idea but look at the other oddly shaped hubs out there.The best part is just having to plug and unplug 1 USB cable when I takeoff with my laptop now.",1
"Explore the possible underlying realities: This isn't easy reading for a first quantum physics book imo, because it quickly gets to the reality interpretations of quantum physics before it discusses the physics. This can make it confusing reading, especially the first time through. If you are already knowledgeable about the quantum facts, then jump right in and explore the possible underlying realities with this book. Any discourse on the reality underlying quantum actions should be somewhat confusing - no one understands it and there are many theories.",1

"Worth the Wait: We've waited a long time for this release, and the delivery is absolutely outstanding. Rommel's skill with trance music has been used to good effect and has brought the industrial rock style of ""Sacrificed"" up to speed, allowing ""Damaged"" to fit in with currently popular EBM releases. The song writing is still exceptional--the songs were emblazened in my head after only one listen. The packaging is generous--a great remix CD and two videos. Rommel is a real musician. If this album does not gain wide, cross-over success, then we'll be lucky.",1
"Just say NO both upside down and rightside up.: Tried them. Plants die for either the pressure from too much water at first or not enough water the next day. Once the full sun hits the bag, basically it gets so hot inside the bag regardless of the outside air temp that the roots cook or the water dries up. I did not take an actual temp reading but when I finally gave up and dumped one out to feel the dirt, it was as hot as the decaying dirt in my compost pile. Heat that is part of why a compost pile destroys weeds, etc. Bad idea that is presented well on TV. Do not bother. Total waste of time. If you need to hang your veggies just get a hanging basket with peat moss etc., and hang them the right side up.",0

"Brotherhood 3-Young Demons: I was very disappointed in this installment. I liked the first 2 versions but found this dull and boring.

"Perspective Shifted: You can tell the author is a poet. This story was beautifully written, insightful and certainly rang true. When I finished reading it I felt I had gained a new perspective about how it must be for people who have their homeland torn apart by war. They love their homes, so the answer isn't just fleeing to freedom and safety. For some, there just is no answer. This book turned on new lights for me and moved as well as frustrated me. We can't just save the world with our wealth and generosity, as such actions are viewed by so many good and honest people as signs of arrogance and naivety. I enjoyed the closure the author proveded with the epilogue (after all, it was in part, a love story), but in reality the fugitive's fate probably would remain a mystery. This is a wonderful book, a keeper.",1
"Burping: I bought these from amazon because I was having trouble finding them in stores. I went to walmart who usually carries them not wanting to spend to much for somthing my baby is just gonna puke on, they told me they didnt carry any so I came here and found these. They suck...badly. These are not very absorbent, except for the middle part on the mostly brown one. They are reasonably attractive iv had many ppl ask what they are becuz they dont exactly look like ur average burp cloth. I would do better to use a kleenex to burp my baby they would be more absorbent.",0
"It's rare to find a good art book, by a great artist: This book, transcribed by Sloan's wife (who was a former student of his), reads something like a working notebook at times, but, if you are a serious student of art (as every working artist should be), there are sentences in this book worth digesting over and over again. You might not agree with everything Sloan says, but there is an obvious strength here, built during a lifetime of study and teaching. Sloan was yet another great teacher from the Art Student's League (other teachers included Bridgeman, Hale, and Nicolaides who published significant books of their own), and one of the major painters of the Ashcan school of painting. I'm grateful for this book and wish that there were dozens more written by other significant painters.",1
"Great Box Set: This is a great box set. If you like Tom Clancy, then you will like these movies. It is also a great deal to buy them all together, much cheaper then the local store.In short, you can't go wrong.",1
"Sad, depressing, emotional outlet for...someone: The book is beautifully designed and drawn. And, techniques of film are used successfully to tell the story through 'thought bubble' equivalents, and flashbacks. But, in the end, the story is just sad, does not redeem itself, and doesn't leave you with any significant insights. For this, I see this work as simply the venting or emotional outlet for the author, either actual or imagined. Not too different from Woody Allen's simply using his art as an outlet for his neuroses (with a very few exceptions).My kids were picking up this book, attracted to the colorful images, so I threw it in the garbage. I couldn't think of anyone who I would want to share this with, and certainly didn't want my kids looking at it. I truly hope this is not the experiences of the author, relived through this sad and abused character.",0

"A SURPRISING RELEASE: I recently saw this film in Los Angeles at a screening there when I was visiting a friend and was surprised that I had not heard more about it. Good film. Well Made and full of hotties. Natalie Kelly is smoking in this. She oozes Sex when she is on screen. Jesse Metcalf gives a great performance along side Johnny Messner (WHO IS CRAZY IN THIS), Corrupt, Chase Crawford, Vinnie Jones, Lochlyn Munro, and Corey Large. The cast is great, the acting is good, and the film is interesting in its style, plot and execution. Again the girls were hot!!!I dug the score and source music in the film. It overall has a very fresh and young vibe to it. Would recommend it to those looking for something to caters to that Fast and Furious crowd. Good flick.",1

"Don't read the book: Notice how most of the reviews with lower ratings are by those who have read the book, AT THEIR LEASURE. Lesson here: don't read the damn book. Clearly, reading this book will only disappoint you when you watch the movie; besides, who the hell has time to read the book. Just watch the movie! It's a really good movie. Of course there are better ones out there but this is worth the watch, and not a waste of your time!",1
"Sansa e280 8GB is actually a pretty good buy: The benefits: navigation is easy, the FM radio and voice record feature, no itunes, ample storage... It honestly is a pretty decent mp3 player, small and nice. the screen got a little dusty but i'm sure i can fix that, i just have to get around to doing that...the negative, I actually had to use tech support b/c all of my music somehow disappeared even though there was 500 songs on there, and this was within the week that i received it. I should check if i still have that problem. maybe it was just mine but overall i still think it's a pretty good mp3 player, practical, compact, classy looking (i like blue and black) and it's easy to use... oh and the price is excellent",1
"Excellent Windbreaker: I was taking an Alaska Cruisetour and looking for something that would be warm, had a hood, would be light and easy to pack. I was also shopping at the last minute. They were out of the color I originally requested, but called me immediately, we changed colors and I had the item in my hands within a couple of days. It was perfect for what I needed! It was easy to carry and the hood was zipped inside the collar. I was very pleased with the product. It was a man's windbreaker, so I just ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. I would definitely buy from them again.",1
"This movie was cookie-cutter, everything was cut and dried, more simple than a child would make the story of the crucifixion.: The fellowship of the uninteresting and the annoying is gathered here to save the world from some vague danger and aid in the rise of another vague messiah by helping some lady from a vague place escape back to said vague place. They will have to defeat grass monsters by staring them in the eyes, and that will be pretty much it for action. They will have to other wise clean pools, repair toilets, and make cell-phone calls for the entire rest of the movie.No action scenes whatsoever!The bludgeoning simplicity of the tale made it so silly.There weren't even any fairy creatures.(You can see more of the Grass Monster in the trailer than you can in the movie. And the only other fairy creature is a tree/monkey thing--that I couldn't really see very well because it was in the dark--and it left after being on screen for two seconds.)",0

"I don't rent video games: The DRM required by the game's publisher prohibits me from buying it, though I have been looking forward to doing exactly that for around two years now. I often upgrade my computer with new hard drives, etc requiring re installation of windows. Spore with the current DRM scheme would only be playable for me for less than a year. I will not pay $50 for a game that I can not continue to enjoy.",0
"Bosch Portable Table Saw: This saw is great, whether on the job or in the shop. I ordered the extensions for the side and back and the dust bag for use outside. the extra stuff is very affordable and well worth it. I like the fence it comes with. It moves very nice. Plenty of power. I suggest a better blade for the saw though. I put a thin kirf Freud blade on mine and it works even better. I highly recommend this saw to anyone who wants a saw that will last and take some abuse.",1

"Poor sound compared to Beats by Dr Dre: I tried Beats by Dr Dre for a day. Then decided to order Sennheiser PCX 450. I tried them only for about 20 minutes and decided to return them. The sound of Sennheiser is so much inferior, I could not believe. The bass in Sennheiser does not exist. Also, there is vibrating sound when I turn my head towards my left arm. It's very bad when noise cancelling headphones create noise.",0
"Upstairs/Downstairs Redux: It is easy to form an addiction to this frothy soap opera of early 20th century English lives! The costumes and the set design are scrumptious. One could wish for a bit more of the history and politics (you'd better already know it, to have a real context) but ""The History Channel"" this is certainly not! However, the densely-plotted story lines - while admittedly overwritten - keep you hopping from one richly-drawn character to the next. Our favorite character is the dowager duchess played acerbically by Maggie Smith; she herself is worth the price of this set!It is wonderful to have the entire season in one package, with no commercials.",1

The labels inside are clear and the areas are bright. My daughter was able to easily use the manual, that was in the box, to work out what each brain area was called and what it's function was.The outside was kind of rubbery and squisy so we could get a better idea of the delicateness of the brain.The only issue I could find was that the halfs of the brain don't stay together that well.",1

"Historically Inaccurate: While there is no complaint about the acting and sets on this movie, this Hollywood script is wildly, ridiculously and sadly inaccurate. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because Alan Rickman, the lead actor, gives a sensitive performance; unfortunately--and probably not his fault--the character he portrays has nothing to do with the historical Mesmer, who most acknowledge as the father of hypnosis.I advise my hypnosis students to avoid watching this film at all costs. A far better depiction of Mesmer and his famous baquettes, although only taking up a small portion of the movie, can be found by watching James Ivory's fabulous film, ""Thomas Jefferson in Paris,"" starring Nick Nolte as Thomas Jefferson (perfect casting; who would've guessed it?!) and featuring a young Gwyneth Paltrow.Booklet: The Amazing Doctor Mesmer (Hypnosis and Guided Imagery)",0
"My time comin', any day, don't worry about me, no.: Dennis was going to take his time with this book, because he was the man in the know, the ""insider"" and he was finally going to tell the story like it was. He didn't. I waited for YEARS for this book and it was a severe disappointment. Reveals nothing about personality of the band members, nothing! I followed the band for more than a decade, waited six years after Jerry'sdeath for ""Scrib"" to tell it the real story, only to discover that Rock Scully and Blair Jackson had already done it. Myheartfelt appreciation to BLAIR JACKSON for writing the definitive bio of the band, without even being an ""insider"".",0
"Two words: rent it: As a fan of past Batman animated releases -- especially Mask of the Phantasm and Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero, I had to see this.Some of the visuals are very sumptuous, but some the character designs for Batman are quite ugly.Mainly this video falls down on the concept: trying to tell six short short stories in about 65 minutes. There isn't any room for character development, hardly any room for plot development.Unless you groove on watching the visuals over and over, the best advice I can offer is to rent it. Once. It's worth about a buck or two to see, but that's it. If I bought it, it would only gather dust on the shelf.",0

"Not a good way to get started: Colloquial Croatian expects far too much of a beginning learner of a foreign language, and the information it does provide is often confusingly explained and organized. When a new grammatical point is introduced, minimal exercises are provided which allow you to practice it, and most of those do not have an answer key. Tables of declensions and conjugations are provided in the back, but in the main text they are replaced instead by verbal explanations which often left me flipping through the pages trying to find the appropriate form. The dialogs and text selections are too numerous and complicated to absorb effectively. Intermediate-level students will find it a useful tool for review and additional learning, while casual learners will find it a place in the recycling.",0
"Deceit and Consequence: This is a fine story depicting the consequence of lying incessantly. Clifford Irving (Gere) lies to everyone and ends up unable to avoid lying even to himself. The message is powerful and lucid, but the film never hits the viewer over the head with it. It is done well.Richard Gere is terrific in this film. HE IS Clifford Irving! Never does the viewer feel that perhaps he is lamenting his dishonesty. Instead, his character demonstrates how, after a while, we become exactly what we dissimulate being. Gere give enormous credence to the theme - once again showing that when the role is good, he shines as brightly as the best.The supporting cast is good, and I didn't see a weak performance in the drama. This is fine entertainment with a lesson subtly attached.",1
"Many other options; however nice background noise: I'm a long time game master and am always looking for good background music to set the tone for an event or situation presented in my games. I found Legends of Kitholan Vol. 1 to be a good background but its not significant enough for me to justify a high rating. There's no comparing this sound track to Midnight Syndicate; Legends of Kitholan is more of a generic feel for dungeon crawling. I would recommend this sound track to a younger audience. In the end, I didn't find anything new on this sound track, nor was I impressed with the price for what you get. If your going to buy this sound track be sure to download the MP3 album to save what money you can.",0
"J.R. Johnson: I have experience some difficulty with this camera feeding film and rewinding. On the first roll I shot, the film got stuck at the end of the roll. I was able to rewind it by pressing the automatice rewind button.

"Truly Sacred!: I enjoyed this book based on the reality of what can happen within the confines of the church. Pastors, are generally put on a pedstal based on there connection with God and His people; however what many fail to realize is that behind the title lies a fleshly man and his ego. Nicolle, the author does a wonderful job drawing you into the relationship between Natalie Thomas and Pastor Kevin Lewis. What seemed innocent and inviting, unravels the truth of the flesh.",1
"What's all the fuss about?: I am a writer of fiction and non-fiction, and was curious to read this book for myself after seeing all of the great reviews. I found the author's condescending tone to be a major irritation throughout the book. I also found the information to be condensed and not useful. If I want to create a character who is a serial murderer, I can research it myself instead of getting a brief checklist of character traits. This is the least helpful book on writing that I have read this year.",0
Excellent!: Really excellent! Sound and beats ranges from Orbish ambient to Astral Projection trancy. I love to put this on with the Dancing Galaxy album from Astral Projection. If you like Banco de Gaia and Eat Static you'll like this....,1
"Great ending!!!!: The book started like the first one, jumping from here to there and I believed that it was going to be the same, but after the half of the book, everything changed and I found myself unable to close the book until I finished in one afternoon. I'm glad about the way this second book came about.",1
"JAPAN MINI LP A MUST HAVE: TRUE COLLECTORS ITEM. COMES IN HARD COVER MINI LP SHAPE ALBUM, WITH ORIGINAL FIRST PRESSING 3-D COVER AND A CARD OR STICKER IN THE BACK (LOOKS SILVER). THERE WERE 2 ALBUMS RELEASED. ONE WAS IN MONO THE OTHER IN STEREO. THE STEREO WAS THE BEST SOUND TO CHOOSE FROM. SINCE IM A COLLECTOR OF JAPAN RELEASES. SOME ARE NOT MEANT TO BE OPEN AND OTHERS ARE. THIS GEM IS ONE OF THEM NOT TO OPEN. SO I CANT TELL YOU IF ITS IN STEREO OR THE MONO VERSION.",1
"An excellent game: I have had this game for several years, I bought it when I was running a 200mhz with 64 mb ram back in 1997. Even back then, this game played extremely smooth with 64mb ram and a 8mb video card. The game play seems difficult at first like some of the other reviewers have stated. But if you stick to some basic controls, your ship is usually durable enough to get you thru any mission. The movie sequences are very cool and the games background music is very true to film scores, but also very original and haunting. Give this game a try for the 5.00 bucks.Someone should ask if they perfected it for XP, last time I tried it had a lot of problems with XP. I still play it occasionally on an older system running ME and it runs OK.The original version was on 5 cd roms, I can only hope they have condensed it to fewer discs now-a-days.",1

Extremely Poor Product: A beautiful stainless steel case but that is all. The can top is cut ragged leaving it sharp and dangerous. Many times it fails to turn the can so you have to help it along by rotating the can. It rips the labels to shreds. This product is a waste of money. I do not recommend it.,0
"a voice that finally moves to the front.: Audrey Wheelers voice is so beautiful and this album proves it.Audrey's done so much in her career,That alot of people don't realize.She has sung background for Kashif,The System,Najee,Jeff redd,Mike Davis,Millie Jackson,Keith Washington,Ultra Nate,Will Downing just to name a few.She also use to sing with Unlimited Touch.Buy this album.",1
"Bad execution; good idea: At first this sounded like a cool idea. Take the MP3 player from the gym to the car and get your music. No CD's to burn. If there's a quality unit that accomplishes the concept then I would own it. This is not the one.I tried 5 of these (yes really....I'm a slow learner). One worked, well sort of. The issue appears to be in the plug. If the plug connection from the unit to my MP3 player is just right then we have stereo. If not then we have an ""underwater"" sound music coming from the radio. The other units were all ""underwater.""As for the one unit that worked, the quality of the sound is just ok. I'm used to CD's in a good player, or MP3 through headphones. But I'm willing to accept FM quality were it not for the fact that the thing just doesn't work!I'll stick to making CD's, until something of quality comes along.",0
The best book on Ada 95.: This book is the best Ada 95 book in the market. It covers everything about Ada 95 (core language plus all six specialized annexes). Chapters are presented in a tutorial format. Examples in the book are practical and realistic. Best of all you learn features of Ada 95 with a tremendous clarity. What is unbelievable is the ability of the author to teach you some complex topics in a step by step manner leaving no room for confusion. This book is complete in every way and entertaining. If you are a serious Ada developer this is a MUST BOOK. I use this book to teach adavnced Ada 95 classes.,1
"Very disappointed: Initially, I thought this would be a great toy because we have the 12"" Spider-Man for our 3 year-old and thought Spidey's nemesis would be a great addition. Although this action figure looks GREAT, it does NOT perform well. The four tentacle arms are so heavy and long that Dr. Ock cannot stand up on his own; you MUST hold him up yourself. Also, the figure is NOT very durable. We have not had this item a week and one arm has a slight crack incurred while trying to remove his overcoat (the human arms do not bend well and removing the overcoat, while possible, is quite awkward). Today, while playing with it with my son, one of Dr. Ock's tentacles broke off at the joint where it joins his back so now only three tentacles can be used. We still have the receipt so we are planning to return this item where we purchased it. This toy was a big disappointment.",0
"Self-aggrandizing Piece of Trash: This book had some promise - the first chapter or two made for an interesting read. After that everything went to pot.It was quite obvious that the main character, Harriet, was a young Ms. Tartt. Or, how old Ms. Tartt envisioned young Ms. Tartt. This book was self-aggrandizement on an epic scale. Reading this was like wading through a swamp filled with so much bull that you could hardly move because of the smell.It took me over two years to finally finish the book. I started reading it approximately 15 times, each time putting it down for more interesting and intelligent texts, such as ""The Cat in the Hat"". I'm still not entirely sure what this book is about...murder, meth, snakes, or summer camp.This is the first and only book that has made me say the following:""I will never get the 10 or so hours of my life that I spent reading that back.""Seriously, Donna Tartt should have paid me to read this book.",0
"Delicious recipes!: I'm not a vegetarian, but I bought this cookbook for new ways to make veggie sides, and it's terrific! Every recipe I've tried so far has been a hit.",1
"4 stars only because a bit dated: A must read for anyone who has begun to question the received knowledge about investing and the stock market (efficient market, 12% long range growth rate, etc.) A reality check for anyone who has believed the results of an online calculator from practically any popular ""individual investor"" web site and been confident their portfolio will last 30 years at a 7%-up withdrawal rate, and similar fables dished out by the popular press during the tech/Internet boom that just busted.Fascinating book, sounds prophetic in places in light of current economic/market conditions.",1
"this movie posed as being funny more than 'b-rad' did: this movie was HORRIBLE! GARBAGE! it tried to be funny, failed, and you could easily tell. it was rarly REALLY funny. and it got so 'average movie' like i almost fell asleep when i watched it. if you like the show 'Spongebob Squarepants' or things like it you might enjoy this movie if you were unbelievably bored.",0

"Detailed account of most successful sub commander: Some may use the word reckless to describe Fluckey's tactics but nonetheless The USS Barb's patrols did revolutionize subwarfare. I found the book slightly repetitive and the author's non-stop optimism and compliments of his crew to be a little unreal. Surely somebody made a mistake once in a while! That said, this is an important book that doesn't gloss over the battles and the Barb was involved in plenty. I am sure this is required reading in Groton.",1
"Neo-Dub Treasure: I happened upon this one while digging through the bins at a local record store. The Groove Corp. brings Dub into the 21st century by adding bits of electronic sorcery to the sounds of traditional 70s roots dub.Any fan of traditional dub (King Tubby, Prince Far I, Lee Perry, etc...) will enjoy this CD.Be sure to check out track 5, which contains a small sample from Bob Marley's Natural Mystic and features a text-to-speech rendition of War. Very novel.Track 6 is more of a jungle/dub sound for those who like things a bit more hard hitting. The rest, however, should keep you in a mellow mood.",1
"BEST ALBUM I HAVE HEARD IN A REALLY LONG TIME!: Ashlee Simpson's album, Autobiography, is the best album I have bought in a really long time. It has a great punk/rock/pop sound. It is a great CD to listen to your friends with in the car! You can rock out to songs like ""LaLa"" and ""Surrender"", but there are also slower songs like ""Shadow"" and ""Unreachable"". You definately get your moneys worth with this album!",1
"Narration hard to take!: I am an avid audio-book fan, and own 30 unabridged, Nero Wolfe audio books. Naturally, this book interested me, and I purchased it with a Christmas gift certificate. What a disappointment!! The narration is high-pitched and grating. I truly cannot understand how the producers chose to use this narrator. My mother listened to the set before me and refrained from saying anything so as not to spoil the set for me. Once I commented on the poor narration, she felt free to say that she strongly disliked the narration to. What was Audio Editions thinking? Please choose the narrators with thought next time.",0
"bubble lights: Picture is wrong; I thought I was ordering 7 lights and instead was ordering a box of 3; the description was changed, but the picture is still showing 7 lights; I'm very dissappointed in advertisers that do not show the correct pictures with what they are selling on Amazon.com. They should correct it.",0
"A one-sided account: ""It was an irony of the war that IBM equipment was used to encode and decode for both sides of the conflict"" (p. 344). Too bad there wasn't more info like that that actually looked at IBMs role in winning the war to counterbalance this decidedly one-sided account. Every step that IBM made during the war years is portrayed as evil and just doesn't ring true to me. If you're going to give IBM this sort of treatment, you're going to have to go after hundreds if not thousands of other companies who backed the Hitler regime. After I finished reading this book I wasn't convinced that IBM was all that different than any other corporation that did business with Germany at that time and am still scratching my head trying to figure out why they were singled out. Bad judgment in high places is nothing new and, motivated by their hatred of Jews, a rabid Nazi with a pencil could've given an IBM Hollerith machine a run for its money if he had been forced to.",0
"READ THE ENTIRE SERIES: I enjoy historical, Christian reading and found this series very enjoyable. Though some may think it slow or boring in parts, it really describes the believable life of the settlers on a daily basis. By today's standards they would seem boring, but Ms. Snellings careful descriptions of life in that setting was intriging to me and kept my interest.I like the way she grew the territory with different characters and wove their lives into existing families. No extremes such as over-done sex scenes or violence to haunt me. Just realistic life-scenerios for the era.I look forward to reading more of Ms. Snelling's work.",1
"great sleep aid: I love this product and have used it occasionally for over 2 years. It works faster than pills and is easier to administer because water is not necessary. I like to always have this on hand, especially when traveling, just in case I have difficulty sleeping.",1
"THANK YOU HEINTJE: I'll still give this album a five star rating even though some of Heintje's songs have been repeated from previous albums. I love this singer very much, that is why I am getting six of his albums from Amazon.com. Two being Christmas music. I have nothing but praises and compliments for Heintje. Keep on singing Heintje, You're the best. THANK YOU!",1
The perfect boot for the job: I bought this boot to use in mucking around the swamp behind our cabin. I had to return the first pair because they run quite large. I ended up ordering a full size smaller than any other shoe/boot I own. They are sturdy and have great traction. I liked them so much I went and bought a pair for my wife too.,1
"Love the 2.1 better than the new ones: I have the 2.1 Version and a friend has the 3 version. I updated to 5 Silver and my friend also reviewed it. We both feel that the 2.1 and 3 are better. They are much easier...seems to have more variety of cards. I would like to be able to buy another 2.1 or 3 for other friends for whom I know 5 would be too confusing as it certainly is for me. If CreataCard would combine either one of these with more cards and programs, ok.I was thinking about 6 but don't think so. Am happy with my 2.1 and will try to get to know 5 better but am not as happy with it as I had hoped.",0
"Great knife for the price.: For the price and blade quality, you can't beat this knife. It has a great edge. I'm not to crazy about the pocket clip being on the butt end of the handle but its a nice low profile so I can live. The handle is comfortable and thing. The blade is a little thin for my taste but that also helps with it being light weight. Overall I would recommend this knife.",1
"Engrossing story: I don't often pick up series romances anymore because I've been disappointed over the last few years, but I bought this one on impulse and really enjoyed it. The conflict keeping the hero and heroine apart was strong and believable. The story pulled me in and held on -- I read the book in one sitting. I'll definitely pick up other titles by Elise Mayr to see if all her stories are this good.",1
"Brotherslicko: Well, I have heard about Ben Harper off and on, for acouple years. I finally bought this CD. I must say, I do not find myself drawn to it. I don't have a need to listen to it. It's somewhat forgetable. I would have thought with his following, I would have stubbled upon some great work.",0
"Fine Orchestra, Fine Conductor, Poor Miking/Mixing, Indifferent Performance!: My title sums it all up. DG's mike placement and mixing leave a lot to be desired, but most of all, what bothers me is the matter-of-fact performance of these two symphonies, which are some of the most beautiful music that Dvorak has ever written. I was also bothered by some of the poor intonation on part of the cellos & bases (too sharp!!!), second clarinet (in soft sustained chords - sharp!!! - sticking out like a sore thumb, despite the poor recorded sound). All in all, not a very good performance, though the 8th fared somewhat better than the 9th, which is not saying much! Look for the Kertesz/LSO recording of these -- much more musical and expressive!",0
"Threw away about 20mins later...: The catch is that the mirrored image you get through this add-on projects a different scale view to your mirror whilst of course taking away space on your mirror from your regular view. So if you have a relatively small external mirror (and not a huge big thing like some SUVs do - it might be OK on those), then this thing obstructs the regular close-by views you are supposed to be getting from your car's mirror and then gives you a differently scaled view of everything else which now appears miles away on this tiny add-on (when it really isn't). Yes it catches the blind spot but can be confusing for all other view angles. I would not give it a safety pick confidence vote...",0
"Good probiotic for infants/kids: I use this for my 3 kids, it has been easy to mix in bottles/cups for all the different ages of my kids. Definitely seems to have helped all of mine have strong guts, no issues with constipation/gas/diarrhea etc. However, I do wish it was shipped in a cold pack.",1
"Melodic metal: Club Ninja was poorly received when it came out, possibly due to the absence of a hit single. In retrospect, it was underrated. Perhaps it is best described as light metal, with some progressive touches. The musicianship is excellent, with solid guitar work, and pleasant organ backgrounds. The vocals are smooth, with nice harmonies. With the exception of one cover, which seems out of place, the songwriting is inspired, with interesting melodies and unusual lyrical themes. This new edition features digital remastering, and superior sound quality. While Club Ninja is not as strong as some of Blue Oyster Cult's better-known albums, like Agents of Fortune, it is much better than it has been given credit for.",1
"Great phone for the elderly: Purchased this phone for my 87 year old mom who has some dementia, is legally blind, and has hearing loss. It seems to be working well for her, the TAlk button is large, and the 3 memory buttons across the top make it easy for her to call.",1
Play was freat: Not crazy about this version. I had an old cassette that I purchased from the play in Downtown Cleveland many years ago that was 95% better than this London cast. Very disappointed.,0
"LIttle Office of BVM: This edition of the Little Office of the BVM is a post-Vatican II version. I hate to admit it, but I don't know how to say the Little Office to benefit from the Brown Scapular. Sure, there are morning and evening prayers for the days of the week, but the other ""hours"" seem to reside in a rather long Office of Readings. So I donated my two copies to my parish church and ordered a traditional version from another source.",0
"YUM: These are terrific! My husband is a juvenile diabetic and this is a little treat I can give him. Parents will love giving these to their kids since there's no sugar. A great alternative to the ""high in sugar"" sweets!",1
"80's flashback fun: I remembered this movie from when I was younger as being campy and fun. It is still fun, with songs by Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Ry Cooder... Bill Paxton is the dorky bartender, and Ed Begley Jr. shows up as a bum. Michael Pare flamed out shortly after this, but Diane Lane, Willem Dafoe and Rick Moranis went on to have pretty great careers and it's fun to see them in this crazy movie. The story is mythical, kind of an Orpheus thing, but the drama is played over the top.... oh, and Amy Madigan is in it as a soldier for hire. It was fun.",1
"Terrible film.: This guy, that made his attempt at directing and writing obviously is about 5 years behind the rest of the pack when it comes to black cinema and the lack of funding for production and the lack of a theatrical release indicates this.Bad sound and camera work, simple story outline and all of the first time actors round out the cast that spend their only time tslking in a circle standing still begs one to turn the channel. Music is lame and the story is boring. We as black Americans must be truly starved for our own product if this is percieved as in any way shape or form as being a film.",0
"Infuriating: One of the most worthless items I've ever had. No troubleshooting information in the manual. Works when it wants as opposed to when I want. Charge doesn't seem to last a day without any use. Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy. It's worked twice in three weeks and instead of answering the last call, it just beeped incessantly.I think I'll give up on bluetooth. And I'll certainly have nomo Moto!One star because Amazon will not let me give it a lower vote.",0
"Logos: The CD Is ok. The DVD seems to be recorded in the 80's. Plus, there is this annoying logo. Between every song the company logo is there. Plus, I didn't think the DVD was attractive enough to my 1omyhs old baby. Sorry...",0
"Excellent: What's up with everyone yes the Original Crow is a classic a totally excellent movie but if you like it i can't see how you don't like the second. One As they are very similar in alot of respects. The third Crow ""Salvation"" stays true to the original storyline but offers a lot of new ideas and themes. To other reviewers even if you think ""Salvation"" and ""City of Angels"" aren't as good as the first crow movie they are still excellent movies in their own rights. I think that this movie is defiantly better than the second movie and almost as good as the original Excellent go out and buy this movie if you are a Crow fan.",1
"This book is in Spanish -- Watch out!: This book is in Spanish, though nothing on the Amazon pages say this.",0
"Just not worth it: Though the price is right, I didn't like the final results. I tried putting this on my Zune at least a dozen times and couldn't keep from getting dust, a fingerprint or something under it. I also couldn't get it to slide all the bubbles out. I finally went and ordered an invisibleSHIELD and though it was considerably more in price, the ease of putting it on (flawless the 1st time) was worth the extra money.",0
"Most Bland KCup Coffee I've Tasted: We love our Keurig KCup Coffee Machine and have been experimenting with various brands of KCups. We bought the Gloria Jean Sample pack because of the refreshingly exciting names of the coffees, expecting the tastes to be just as excitingly refreshing. Unfortunately, they all taste the same and with closed eyes we are unable to tell the difference between any of them (except the chocolate, which is probably more smell than taste). All are very bland, whether dark or light, with very little taste. By far, the most distinctive and delicious brand we've found so far is Tully's and have not been disappointed with any of their flavors.",0
"Doesn't handle crushing ice without breaking down.: I've gone through two blades. You would think a big, heavy blender like this would have an ounce of guts, but this thing is really horribly made. It's sort of challenged by anything other than mixing jello smoothies with marshmallows. Get it together Cuisianart!",0
"Your Lodge will outlive you!: Cast Iron is ALWAYS a good value for the money and it's indestructable (I'm still using my mother's Lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954). This dutch oven goes from the table to the campground with ease. It stews and bakes beautifully - get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis at home! Cast Iron still manages to look dressy on a table and you can tote it from your stove to the church potluck! Also makes a fabulous wedding, shower, or housewarming gift. Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride this Lodge Dutch Oven and Lodge Cast Iron Skillet. She'll hand them down to the next generation. Also great for those kids who just moved into their first apartment - they'll never destroy THIS piece of cookware no matter what they burn! A must have for EVERY cook.",1
Wonderful Story that went no where: I wanted to like this book but it drug on and on saying nothing. I could not wait until it ended to see if there was a end that would make it worth while. It was not there.,0
"[...]: This is one of the most important books that I have ever read. I have been teaching Men's Groups for over a decade, and I continue to search for study guides that are perfect for men: short chapters, concise, simple, redundant, and a profound theme. This is THE book. After our group went through the book and the study guide, we grew deeper in our walk with Christ together. It had a significant effect on our connectedness as a group of men.You have heard some concerns that Roy's message of the cross is works based, but I believe that he is discussing the process of sanctification and not salvation.I continue to hear from men of the life changing effects of reading this book. The themes of humility, confession, and brokenness are so important to all of us.",1
Tastes fine at first..: This stuff smells good and tastes fine at first but it is way too sweet and leaves that aftertaste of fake sugar. No thanks.,0
"I Couldn't Finish It: I tried to listen to this book on CD. Unfortunately, it was an abridged version. I usually love John Grisham, but I couldn't even finish this. It was like listening to a boring history book with endless dates and events. I wanted to get involved in the plight of the defendants, but just gave up after 2 of the 5 discs. I didn't even know that it was a true story until I looked at the reviews on this page. Perhaps this book would appeal to some lawyer types who love legal proceedings and courtroom details, but not to this 60 year old grandmother.",0
"Not what it looks like on computer screen: This kitty pad with fleece cover looked nothing like the picture that was on the computer screen. It is very small for the price and if you have a large outdoor cat then forget it. It is barely big enough for a medium sized cat. Also, the cord on it isn't very long. I would not buy another one unless I bought it in person and was able to see the item.",0
"1"" Weaver Ring: They are not good for powerful pellet guns. They don't keep the scope in place at all, every time I shoot the scope moves back.",0
Hurts my ears after 25 minutes of use: This headset is ok but hurts my ears like hell and I'm planing to buy new once just because of that reason. I had fatalitys pro and they where the best I ever had but then again I paid $50.00 for them. I got this headsets for $25.00 and I only hoped that I did spend the extra $25.00 more so I could enjoy the comfortability I had before and not worry about my ears hurting after 25 minutes of use. Would not buy ever again.,0
"Worth the Price: I originally had a Bodum Brazil, which was fine and looked good, but eventually broke. This press, while slightly more expensive, seems substantially sturdier, has good weight, and disassembles for cleaning much easier. Great product.",1
"This movie just DRAGS!: This movie just drags... Its really hard to get focused when there are a lot of irreverence in the movie. The LONG rehearsal dinner could have been short and sweet but that was rather irritating when it kept going. If you want to see a movie about Rehab and family, I recommend, ""28 Days"". Far better.",0
"great little light: I bought this little light mainly as a battery consuming device. I wound up with a couple hundred AG13/ LR44 batteries since I mis-ordered once and they're so incredibly cheap from Hong Kong (yet just as good as the blister pack 2 for $3.95 at the drug store batteries). Figured this little guy would help me to burn through all those batteries before they go bad. Thing is, it doesn't eat the batteries all that fast & light output is really good for the size & price. People are constantly amazed. I carry it always. use it several times a day and have come to depend on it. Going to buy several for business gifts & give away a couple 10 packs of those batteries with them.",1
"Not bad, Great special effects Story line in the original was better IMO.: Great special effects Story line in the original was better IMO. But it is a relatively good movie. As long as you arent expecting more than great effects, shallow story and a lot of action.",1
"Great head light, bad tail light.: The headlight is super bright, and the blink feature is great for the daytime. Installs easily, but you might need to use pliers to make it tight enough to not move. The tail-light is almost useless though. Can hardly see it on a bright, sunny day. It's so small, that during the night drivers will misjudge the distance to you. Has a VERY loose braket on a topeak bike rack. Not a great item for bad city steets.",0
No!NO!NO! That's just wrong!: All I can really say is that it was a really bad and twisted version of the work of a Genius(THAT GENIUS BEING DAVEY HAVOCK!) and it really sucked and made me want to smash my radio into a millon tiny little pieces! Bad Idea guys!,0
"NOT written by Bobby Fischer: I got this book a couple of years ago and didn't like it it much because I felt it was a cheap imitation of 1001 Brilliant Checmates by Reinfeld (a much, much better book if you want checkmates to work on).Then it came out in the news! Bobby Fischer didn't write this book, he was approached by somebody else who wrote it and then agreed to put his name on it. This is because Bobby Fischer who is now in prison in Japan has been in the news again. Finally the searching for bobby Fishcer is now over and this book was found to never be writen by him.Now it is bad because it is misleading to think the book is teaching you by bobby fisher and that it only has easy to find checkmates in it. Chess is much more complicated than only knowing how to find an easy to find checkmate at the end of a game!",0
"man, was it FUNNY!: Absolutely brilliant and very well executed. And it didn't cheese out, either. Truly, I think that it's an important read. I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it. I pretty much thought it was going to be a poorly written pamphlet of a thing, but what arrived was an extremely well crafted novel.",1
The title says it all: Dinosaurs on a spaceship... It's my favorite of the season so far... A spaceship with dinosaurs get hi jacked .... It's great fun.. Including Rorys dad who is played by the wonderful Mark Williams.,1
"Simply GREAT: When I initially scanned the different cuts, I didn't quite know what to think. It was a bit jazzy, a bit latin, a bit blues, a bit techno, a bit euro, a bit lounge,.. like where is this album going? Finally, I gave it a spin, or 2, or 3... The longer it was playing, the more often I kept on going back and checking if I was still listening to the same album. Then I realized that that is what made it so great. This is a great Chill Out album without the repetition or boredom.It's hard to believe that this is all from the same artist/composer; he is so versatile, setting off so many different moods, not monotonous (like so many albums that we've all come across where the artist is playing the same theme over and over). Billy Paul Williams can go from laid back to intense, from smooth to club, while never being too intrusive.Enough said, if you enjoy Chill Out that doesn't get stuck in one groove or on one beat or theme, you'll love this one!",1
"great: This is a cute-looking pot that is solidly built. The handle doesn't get as hot as I imagined considering that it is metal when just boiling water for a short period of time, but if the pot has been heated for a long time please use an oven mitt.",1
"Sound and Sage advise for self determination: I read this book slowly, marking it up and making notations throughout, as principles expounded came to light. These men had to make high pressure decisions, the result of which were stupendous! They were in positions that required sterling character. The ramifications of their conclusions were paramount. The fate of the free world hung on the balance the situation was desperate.In this study of 19 stars of military character I truly found gold nuggets of wisdom. Principles that are invaluable tools which will assist you to set the sail in your life, and then to get to where you want to go.",1
"A Big Disappointment: Recently I was woken up to the sound of Tower of Power, playing ""Happy about that"", and I was very impressed. I had never heard of this group, and a little surfing revealed all. I promptly ordered ""Oakland Zone"" and listened to it with great anticipation. It was at this point that I realised why the radio station chose to play ""Happy about that"" - it is the only track on the CD worth listening to (settle down you soul experts, I am obviously a newbie here). Seriously though - the one track is very polished and pleasing to the ear, while the remainder of the tracks are nothing but a bunch of what I would class as ""B"" sides. I expect T.O.P. have produced far better in the past - I must give them another chance I guess.",0
"These are NOT mp3s!!!!: Being a fan of Jons music for years, I felt the need to step in here and correct what a couple other reviews have said, that this set is a collection of poor quality mp3s...because it's not.It clearly states on the cd cover that it is a collection of the original Turquoise & Crimson mp3s that have been fully mastered. Which means they took the tracks and MASTERED them to cd quality. The mastering was NOT done from an mp3 source either, and anyone who bought the original mp3 downloads also knows this - as the original mp3s were of pretty bad quality. The tracks on this cd are not of bad quality & if you played the original mp3s side by side with this disc and couldn't hear the difference - you are freakin' DEAF!Great album, great songs. And like others have said - the tracks that later appeared on Nude are here in different versions. Definatley a must have for any VAST fan.",1
Poor quality DVD !!: Poor quality DVD. I think this is a bootleg. Insert artwork doesn'tlook professional and there are major grammatical mistakes in thesynopsis. Can't Amazon get rid of these bootleg products?,0
COSMOS: THIS WAS A REAL FIND FOR THOSE OF US WHO CAN NEVER TIRE OF WATCHING CARL SAGAN ON COSMOS. I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THIS.,1
"Bad Product line: I bought the Sansa e200. It was on sale for about $84. I also bought a power supply for use while traveling. It was a total waste of money. My e200 has menu screens that are neither English or Spanish. The manual/instructions were supposed to be available on Adobe PDF. I have the latest Adobe (8.0), but I cannot bring up the instructions. All attempts to solve this problem have failed. I would never waste my money on another Sansa product.Puffmaru",0
"Greed - Pure and simple: Peter Jackson's involvement was not necessary to include a branching version of the Extended Edition cut on this same Blu-Ray. A technician fresh out of college with the ability to tell where to branch away could do it, while Jackson toils away at the Hobbit. There is no reason to release the BD set in this format but for a hope at quadruple dip instead of a triple dip. Stay away, if only for the sake of principle.",0
"This is ordinary grocery store vinegar: I purchased this Balsamic Vinegar hoping that it would be similar in taste to D.O.C. qualty, 12 year old vinegars. I knew by the price that it wasn't actually aged, otherwise it would have cost four times more. Unfortunately, there was no similarity between a good quality Balsamic Vinegar and this product. I even had a blind taste test to prove it.There is a chain of stores called Oliviers & Co. that sells a $35 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar that is ten times better than this product. I would also recommend Colavita's vinegar over this brand for 1/3 the price.Finally, it is customary for fine vinegars to have the number of years aged on the label or in the name. For these guys to call the Balsamic #12 is rude and misleading. For that reason alone I would add caution to your purchase..",0
"What happen ???: I think 1 star is pretty good for an album like that. What happen with you guys. This album sounds like linken park. No more hardcore sound. It looks it has been done just by a computer. Theres only one listenable song on the cd and the chorus is very bad. What a waste. It couldnt be worse. Thrice used to be good but now all true thrice fans will be very disapointed by this 100% commercial cd. Your favorite granpa radio station will be playing theses songs. This is not thrice, its soft, weak and i wont pay a buck for that.....",0
bad design: This product does not fit standard tubs and was clearly made for much older faucets.It's just poorly designed to fit only round faucet spouts but most contemporary tubs are now rectangular. I was hoping to use the attachment to wash my dog but it does not work at all.,0
"Highly recommended: This book is a good reference for AS/400 programmers who want to use SQL. I've found the answers to almost all my questions and lots of examples of good code. It doesn't cover JDBC programming much (just an overview), which I'd like to see. But the SQL/400 technical information goes from basics to advanced. Most of the embedded SQL examples are in RPG IV and use the latest release, which provides some neat coding techniques. The section on ""soft coding"" triggers is great!Overall, this is a very well done book that I highly recommend.",1
"Great Listening: This is a great CD, with appeal to many listeners. Some like the slower, easier tracks (No Aphrodisiac by The Whitlams), some like the heavy stuff (The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson). Whatever your taste in music, you're sure to find something to please!",1
"HD DVD means old, largely unplayable format: I can't knock the vendor because the item clearly says ""HD DVD"". But be aware (as I wasn't) that HD DVD is an obsolete format. It doesn't on either my DVD player or my computer. I suppose that if PowerDVD will play this format, you could get some good deals on movies (once you spend $60 on PowerDVD). I haven't tried this.I'm cutting my loses.",0
"Boring and different: 5150 was the first album with Sammy Hagar. When he joined, their music changed comletely. Eddie's guitar playing dosen't even sound like a guitar. Their is not one good guitar solo on this record. All the solo's are a bunch of whammy-bar noise crap. Anyway, the cd does show some good tunes like Dreams, and Love walks in. That is about the only songs I can think of. The album proves that VAN HALEN WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ALBUM AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST. It seems that their songs are not as good, and neither is the guitar playing.",0
"broke upon late arrival: It was a cheap gift - but it came 3 days late and it was broke. I was able to fix it though with a bit of super glue. Not completely as promised, but all ended well.",0
"eh: I bought this cd because I loved the song ""All day,all night.""But that turned out to be the only song I liked.And after hearing it about 10 times I got sick of it.so in conclusion I have to say that they arent anything special.They are corny and they dont wright there own music.",0
"Chapped LIPS: I'm a big fan of Surrender Cinema, however their latest entry has me worried that this once ""edgy"" film company has lost it. To begin with, the plot is weak -- but really, who cares. So long as the girls are white hot and the sex is good. Okay, in LIP Service we're batting 1 for 2. As can be expected, the girls were hot. What left me feeling cheated was the sex scenes. For one, there weren't many. For two, the girl/girl scenes were terrible. I thought I was watching a shampoo commercial, what with all the hair stroking. There was no kissing, no excitement, and no heat. After viewing SC classics as Femalien, Virtual Encounters and Veronica 2030, I'm surprised the powers-that-be at Surrender Cinema even let this dreck out the door. Hey, guys, go watch your earlier films ... go back to the basics. Your viewers demand it.",0
"Not as good as the first one.: After watching this movie I was kind of disappointed. The first one is much scarier and the creeper is more mysterious which makes it a better movie. In the 2nd one they show more of the creeper and he definitely doesn't look realistic and I didn't even jump in my seat once. I would say own the first movie, and rent the 2nd one if you haven't seen it because it wasn't that great.",0
"Great Value: These things can take a whole lot of crashing and still look as though nothing has changed. A great value and something that anyone can play with of almost any age. This model is a little easier to control than previous models, but I can't get it to do what the video clip on the website shows it can do. that's ok, its still worth it.",1
"Work of fiction: I think this is a work of fiction. It is true that the communists infiltrated the Catholic Church at all levels, especially behind the iron curtain. But I doubt their propaganda extended to moderist heresies in the West, there is no evidence of this. The words are only those of the author who was rightly upset at the loss of faith among the clergy and religious after Vatican II.Second point, if you hated the narrow emotional and intellectual range of Dostoyevsky's characters, you will not like this book either.",0
"Nice!: Good recipes, lots of variety and even suggestions of how to bake them wheat free in case your dog has problems with wheat. Lots of different grain options (and a few with none). Quality little book.",1
"A True moron and Joke of a Champ is Buried! What not to like?: Warrior sucks, he has always sucked in the ring and how he became a marketable Champ is honestly beyond even the most hardcore fans.Myself, being a Striaght up 100% Wrestling fan sees enjoyment in the works of lets say: Benoit, Angle, Guerrero, Melenko,Jericho,STyles, Daniels, CM Punk, Samoa Joe and all those guys, while the casual wrestling fans love lower talented yet charismatic guys like, Hulk Hogan. Batista. John Cena.ULTIMATE WARRIOR.goldberg.See if your a hardcore pure wrestling fan then you hate the Ultimate warrior since his Talent is very limited.So, If you like flat out wrestlers and absolutly DESPISE the spotlight hogging low talent stars, this burial my be for you.If you enjoy the cartoony, charismatic and gimmicks of Warrior and love him regardless of how absolutly awful his in ring ability is,than this Burial of him isnt for you,",1
"Not what you think: The only thing Marshall about this amp is the name. Sounds like a transistor radio (bad). No tone, no bass. I bought one, kept it 1 day and returned it. Okay with headphones but not much else. I feel that anyone who gives this 'amp' 5 stars must have not have ever used one. Spend the extra $40 or so and get an Orange CR12, or something like it. If you want a Marshall get the MG10. $99 bucks most anywhere. You'll be much better off. I give it one star because they won't let me give it zero.",0
"Bad quality cd's.: I brought these sends to make copy's of my music and when I went to play the cd's on cd play there was lots of static from the cd. I played other cd's and they all played fine so, I know there's something up with Maxwell.",0
Wonderful CD: Chris Botti on trumpet with Paula Cole on vocals; it doesn't get any better than this. I have given this CD to everyone I know and they all love it.,1
"Duel at Diablo: Favorite of mine for a long time. James Gardner rescues a white woman from Apaches yet, she goes back for her child. He of course was fathered by an Indian and the town and her own husband are outraged. Thinking she should have killed herself when captured. Sidney Poitier is also good in this movie about the war in the west between the white man and indians.",1
"Smooth, But Not Smooth Enough: Alien Ant Farm! They're awesome right? Well I beg to differ. Although there cover of smooth criminal is some good music. The rest of the CD is well let's just say not good. Much of it is slow rock with a little zing. Anyway if you like smooth criminal buy the single and not this CD!",0
"Yep, gotta balance out the rating: Just trying to help. Yep, so I heard beat the world on mtv. I think I can say whatever about this band. Screw this band.. get Incubus instead. They're better but I still don't care for either of this band.",0
"Worth it: I've been a BA fan since ""This Time"" (OK I'm dating myself)... I'd say this project wasn't as tight as the Shane's Castle ... but if you like the material on ""A Day Like Today"" this is worth getting - especially since the CD comes with it. I happen to like 3 of the cuts off that project, so it works. If you have to pick one live performance - go with Shane's Castle. Much better sound quality and performance. If you're a fan, this won't dissapoint.",1
"Disappointed!: The dispenser is a neat idea, but the bags would have been ten times better if they had handles. I'm looking round for different bags in a roll, to use with the dispenser. I'm disappointed that the bags are not very user-friendly. I often have to walk quite far to find a doggie bin and the lack of handles is annoying.",0

"Lots of Parts: But nothing really works, not even the stethoscope which would be the easiest thing to work, right? It's disappointing. I wouldn't buy it. It's not worth the money.",0
"Poor design: These are a nice shape and size, and the handles catch drips. But they have a major design flaw--the part of the stick that is frozen into the pop is too small, narrow, and smooth, so when you try to pull your pops out, the handle comes out and the pop stays in. I had to semi-melt the pops under hot water and use a flat spatula to pry the pops out of the base. Not recommended.",0
"heard her on the radio- just got the CD: lol- i guess i must be living in a rock, because i have never watched american idol, because i thought there would not be real talent on there.

"superb spikey folk rock: throughout Epiphany In Brooklyn, Brenda Kahn's acoustic guitar strums along with a fiery drive that enforces her sharp songwriting skills. her songs are stories littered with colourful characters and broken bleeding hearts. the music is Dylan-esque in it's basic approach, but employs plenty of heart and soul to make it stand out as her own. this is a superb collection of songs with ""She's In Love"" probably being my all time favorite. Brenda has a skill for penning some great lyrics and she comes accross as a master storyteller with a sarcastic smirk that seems to cut both ways. i first bought this album on cassette after seeing her ""Eggs On Drugs"" video on some very small independent music video show years and years ago. eventually, i wore the tape out and was saddened to learn that this cd went out of print. thankfully, i got lucky when i found this in a used bin and i've been enjoying relistening back to these great songs full of love, life, wisdom and wit.",1
the best: I loved this book. Anyone into the arts will love this book to. Its great and i personally like Jackie Chan.,1
Please say someone else wrote this!: I love her other books and I think this must have been someone else writing under her name. It was the worst things I have ever tried to read. I could not force myself to finish. I tried and tried and it has beaten me. Maybe the next will be a return of the real Patricia Cornwell we know and love.,0
add more please: backyard basketball is okay but it lacks so many things. For one it's way to easy. Second not enough pro players you can just take all the pro's if there was more it would be harder. Third no pro teams it would be better with pro teams so then it would be at least a little bit realilistic.,0
"Frightening Experience: My daughter recieved this doll as a gift for Easter last April. While the doll is a great toy and is extremely durable from what I can tell, my daughter (22 months old) is uterly terrified of it. We had to put it in the closet before she would even go into her bedroom (knowing it was in the toybox). We as her parents thought she would grow out of it since she was only 14 months when she got it, but she hasnt yet. I would definately see how your child reacts to such toys before purchasing them for small children.It is a humorous to watch the little Elmo rolling across the floor, but not so funny to be cuddling the crying toddler afterwards.",1
A great addition to my Will & Grace collection: Season 5 does not let me down! It's funny and witty. Karen and Jack shine! It's worth the buy!,1
"Kate Shugak-best character I've read since Ross Mc Donald: Another chilling story of life in a harsh, beautiful environment. The plot is intriguing, but what really beguiles is the gritty, intelligent, wild Kate Shugak and Dana Stabenow's talent in bringing us right into the landscape, letting us all become Alaskans for a time. The writing is visual and clips along, the supporting cast memorable and empathetic. Kate's world stays in my mind long after the book is finished. Stabenow can't write fast enough for me.",1
"Eh.: I was somewhat disappointed with this book. The recipes, for the most part, really aren't all that cheap because many of them rely heavily on meat and canned/packaged foods. More-with-less (Herald Press) gives much more economical recipes built around truly inexpensive ingredients such as rice and dried lentils.This book does have a few redeeming qualities, though. The recipes are probably quicker than those in More-with-less, and I suspect they would be more kid-friendly (I can't say for sure because I don't have kids.) Also, I use the recipes for homemade cleaning products.",0
"Works as advertised: I am using this with a Mac, and it has worked great for me. I am using it as a wireless router and to stream iTunes. I have an optical connection to my stereo.Sound quality is good and performance has been very reliable. I have a large collection of music on my hard drive, so this is a much better option than plugging the iPod into the stereo.I was originally experiencing intermittent sound cut-outs, but I just had to re-set the router and it has worked flawlessly ever since.The one gripe is that it does not come with the required cables to connect to your stereo. But these are easily found and purchased online. (mini to optical or mini to analog cable). Also, as you can see from the picture, you have to plug it directly into the outlet -- it does not come with a power cord.",1
"Good Dark Shadows movie: I think this is actually better than the new movie with Johnny Depp. I have been watching the series on and off on Netflix, and I did not even know this existed until recently. The story is good and it covers the whole Dark Shadows story. It has the real Banabas Collins, so it is a must see, if you are into that stuff. If you are into Dark Shadows, don't tell anyone. It's worse than being a trekkie.",1
"UTG vest: really cool vest, comes with 4 shotgun shell holders, and a duel mag holder that u can switch out with the holster.it takes a little time to figure out how to adjust the size.cool camo too. i use it for airsoft but u could use it for the range or hunting. but i had to nok a star off for the stiffnes, but its not that bad i still love the vest. it feels nice when running, which is real good for me.over all very good vest, very useful. get it!!",1
"Intense and superbly played: These eight masterpieces by Chopin have incredible intensity and drama. If you only think of Chopin as a great composer of salon music, think again. All eight of these pieces reach incredible climaxes worthy of Beethoven or Tchaikovsky, etc. The soloist here is not a household name but his playing is absolutely superb and the piano sound is close to perfection. At less than 3 dollars, this CD is one of the great bargains in the entire catalog. If you love the piano and romantic music, this CD is an absolute must.",1
"Faithful to the Original Story: This film really captures the horror of the story Who Goes There by John W. Campbell Jr. He was the editor of Astounding Science Fiction in the 40s when I was in High schol and I read him and the other great authors largely unknown to present day fans. The first attempt to put the story on celluloid called The Thing was a hugh disappointment to us Sci Fi buffs as it had little to do with the plot other than the location on the polar cap. I was relieved to see that the remake captured the overwhelming ominous dread of the printed word that was new to us in our teens. This same alien horror was again used in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, now going into it's third remake I am told. Heaven help us!",1
"Pure crap: I have read all the user reviews before buying the book, and I was expecting a scientific research on Atlantis. It turned out to be crap. It is quoting other Atlantis writers, with very doubtfull statements. Especially their sources are not scientific: they rely on pshycics and other new-age gurus. Her own research is not very convincing and is very suggestive. I hope there is somewhere another book about Atlantis that is more scientific...",0
"A Great Book for Beginner's !!!: This is a great book - very interesting and informative. A must read for the serious martial arts disciple.

So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!: Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.,0
"A wonderfully written true story of recovery from addiction.: This is a story written from the heart. Not only an inspiration for alcohol/drug addictions but for families in need of recovery from disfunction too! While reading the book you hurt, feel joyful, cry, learn about addiction and experience many other feelings. A well written true story of a families struggle!!!!!",1
"Blu Ray Quality: The movie itself is great, but the blu ray isn't very good. It is quite grainy in some scenes and you can clearly see imperfections of the film in certain shots. I have some DVDs that look equally good when ""upscaled"" in my Panasonic BDT210... Long story short, I doubt most people would see a difference from the DVD version for a fraction of the cost.",0
"Realistic and worth watching !!!!!: I would recommend this video for anyone interested in the culture of the mountain people of West Virginia. It does not sugar coat the hard life that these people endure. Southern people, particularly those brought up in hard times should be able to relate to this no nonsense video.",1
"Unbelievable!!!: This is unlike anything you've heard! Yes, there is plenty of Janis Joplin in this album, but there is also so much Big Brother and the Holding Company! You have both male and female voices on this album! Janis Joplin shines, and the best song on the album is ""Call on Me"" it's nothing like you've ever heard. Janis is at her best, and there is another version of ""Call on Me"" on this album. This is a must for any Janis Joplin fan.",1
"Captivating -- draws you into the hearts of two cultures: It was four years ago that I first read Goldman's first novel, and I still recommend it, still search for new books he has written. Long Night beautifully captures the magical essence of Guatemala -- the raw beauty, the mystery, the danger -- while gripping the reader with the desperation of the protagonist's quest and his gradual enlightenment.",1
"Produto sem brilho: O produto no tem brilho algum, seja por conta do ouro, seja pelos ""brilhantes"".Pensei em provocar uma boa reao ao dar o presente, mas confesso a frustrao.Apesar do desconto ser bom, é como dizem: ""voc tem o que voc paga"".No recomendo a compra.",0
"Boring And Predictable: This story was corny, and the ending was predictable. Please Bee Bee, a little more suspence, better dialouge, and surprising plot twists. Through in some emotional depth, and you've got a winner. It's a far cry from ""Your Blues Ain't Like Mine"".",0
"This book is hot.: This book is really awesome. It has a bunch of cartoonsand facts about people turning 30 years old, so it'sgood for people turning 30 years old and it's goodfor people who know someone who is 30 years old.(BTW, I heard that 30 is the new 21, which is awesome.)This book is good stuff, and it's mine. Mine!",1
Could be Better: While I liked the designs in the book and the vibrant colors of the paints.I was disappionted by the fact that when I tryed tomove my design from the window it tore.If the window is to cold your design can tear.If the window is hot your design will fade.Also I think the drying time 24 hours might be to long a wait for some kids.Also you have to have a real steady hand.,0
"Not strong enough for heartburn: Purchased this for heartburn, but it was not as strong as I had hoped and was ineffective. Will have to look for stronger stuff...",0
"Excellent, informative and emotional: This should not be thought of as a feminist book! I think that scares people away. My friend recommended this book to me back in 1995. I have always been fascinated by how women are treated in the middle east. This was an amazing and informative book. I think I read it in less than a week.With everything that is going on right now, I highly recommend this intensely emotional look into the lives of Saudi people and the human rights atrocities that still take place. The world has turned a blind eye to it all because, God forbid, we tell other countries what to do with their women folk.",1
"I love my iLuv: I am very happy with this purchase. I chose this model after reviewing other models and a popular complaint of the other systems was the brightness of the time display. This model has three brightness settings and an OFF setting for the display so is perfect for those who like total darkenss! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the size. This is much bigger than any traditional alarm clock I have ever owned and takes up a considerable amount of space on my night stand. With my lamp, phone and this unit, there is no room for any extra's! It does have a remote so, if you have the right room setup, you could position it elsewhere.",1
"A human mother of many wild chimpanzee children: Stella began collecting orphaned animals practically before she could walk around the grounds of her African home. By age seven she was mothering an infant monkey. Soon she was in charge of a menagerie including an ever growing population of orphaned chimpanzees. The centerpiece of the book is how Stella managed to find a way to support and rear and release into the wild a never ending stream of animals sent from all over the world. She was helped by native Africans, publishers, and even the keepers of Gombe, Jane Goodall and Hugo van Lawik. This is not a story of superwoman, but rather of an ordinary woman with extraordinary determination and love. Read it if you can.",1
"It's going up: I like many bands, i'm not a totally Korn-Freak, but i like the Self-titled Album and Life is Peachy very much. I don't have Untouchables but my Band-homies like it very much. Untouchables was very disapointing for me. No song did really rock.The new album ""Take a look in the mirror"" is a quite good mix of all the korn-cd'sMelodic parts reminding on songs like ""Thoughtless"" (which were the best song on Untouchables), Real raw stuff like on ""Korn"".The vocals are sounding new again. It's like Jon changes his voice with every album they do.The lyrics are not innovative, except Y'all i want a singleThe song-structures are a bit too simple, i think.All in all it's a very good album, but i don't think that this album is as well as albums of bands like deftones, mudvayne, linkin park or their own old cd's4 Stars",1
"Off the grid? Maybe. Out of the matrix? Not a chance...: It makes little sense to me to import things like drywall and 2x4's to the remote Alaskan wilderness and call it living off the grid. Deep cycle batteries, an inverter, a sump pump, just so you can take a shower? Oh Brother! Rube Goldberg anyone? Still relying on the crutch of industrial infrastructure when claiming to want to get away from just that. And what's up with keeping like 60 dogs on a 6 foot lead all day and night except when they're pulling sleds and atv's? Seems cruel to me. If my neighbor did that, I'd call animal care and control. If you want to see a documentary film about living off the grid in Alaska, Check out Alone in the Wilderness. That dude definitely did not need a generator to scratch his ass....",0

"Great Music, Okay Recording: The performers, orchestrations, and Mark Hollmann's score for this Off-Broadway turned Broadway musical are excellent, 5-star. Unfortunately the recording is a little echo-y for my taste and the recording loses a star for that. I've seen the show on Broadway and it's great, I might go see it again soon.",1
"Blood Simple: Filmed on a shoestring budget by Joel Coen and his producer brother Ethan, this heart-pounding homage to 1940s film noir was instantly hailed as a classic of American indie cinema. Featuring Barry Sonnenfeld's innovative camerawork and murky lighting, ""Simple"" not only tells a dark, disturbing tale of murder, passion, and back-stabbing meanness, it introduces the marvelously talented McDormand and features a brilliant performance by Walsh as a sleazy, audaciously amoral gumshoe. Inspired by the novels of James M. Cain and Jim Thompson, ""Blood Simple"" is a gutsy, dark-comic debut thriller by the directors of ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"".",1
"Heh hehheh ehhe....: Wow. Diversity abounds with these two guys, a drum machine, and their dog. What a freakin' pleasure to hear a Patton-esque interpretation of death metal, Hip-Hop culture, disco, hair-guitar, and bizarre junior-high sexual innuendos. PLUS - these guys are actually talented musicians! They can actually play! Mix Mr. Bungle with Queensryche with Nile with The Bee Gees with 2 Live Crew with a baggy of rotting monkey poop - and voila: Crotchduster.",1

"This hub is not reliable: I bought this hub so that I could easily connect and disconnect my various USB devices when coming and going with my laptop. Unfortunately, every time I come back to my desk and plug in the hub, there are always a few, seemingly random, devices that are not recognized. I have to unplug the device from the hub, wait a couple seconds, and then plug it back in again. What a pain! Unfortunately there aren't many hubs on the market with so many ports, and I don't know if any of the others perform better.",0

"Frustrating!: I purchased these trays to replace the Rubbermaid plastic trays that had given me 10 years of satisfaction. While the color and pliability of these trays are a plus, the ice cubes are very difficult to remove. The cubes are perfect squares, and very attractive in a cocktail or glass of iced tea, but I have to push each cube out of its compartment with my fingers, from the bottom of the tray. I expected that a couple of twists would loosen the cubes sufficiently to dump them into my bucket, but instead, I have to pry, push and coax each cube free. It's a pain, and I'm going back to Rubbermaid.",0
"Not that good: I have used this over the years on my Jeep trim and on my Mustangs rear honey comb panel and chin spoiler. It was a real pain to use on the jeeps trim. Once done it only lasted a few days and didn't look all that black. It did an ok job on the rear panel of my mustang but again only lasted a few days. I then found a bottle of Meguiars Gold Class Trim Detailer and tried that. What a night and day difference, I will never use Mothers Back-To-Black again. The Meguiars Gold went on much better then Back to Black and makes all my trim and paneling look %100 better while lasting weeks not days.",0
"Great Film, Lousy DVD: This is a horror masterpiece. There's some good amateur acting and some violence and gore, but there's also a strong plot and an incredibly tense atmosphere. George A. Romero, like Alfred Hitchcock, plays his audience like a piano.This DVD by (shudder) Madacy has lousy picture quality and wafer thin sound. The extras (trivia game, biography, poster art) are typical of Madacy.",0
Princess Tool Kit: I got the tools in a box that had a broken latch. They replaced the box in a timely fashion but the tools would not fit in the new box. When I called they more or less blew me off. Will never buy from them again.,0
"Excellent unit history.: The American 42nd Division was unique in World War One.Composed of National Guard units from twenty-six states,from its start it demonstrated the strengths and weaknessesof the American soldier: brave, naive, eager to fight,always an amateur at heart, slow to accept the militaryconventions of the professional soldier but quick at thecraft of war. The Alabamans, Irish New Yorkers, andMidwesterners who comprised its main units began with theregionalist preoccupations so prevalent in those days, butended as Americans, proud to have served in one of thetop divisions of the AEF. Colonel Cooke's fine historytakes us from conception to demobilization, with clear andcomplete combat narrative and sketches of some famousRainbow Men: Douglas MacArthur, Wild Bill Donovan, theplaywright Charles MacArthur, Joyce Kilmer, Father FrancisDuffy, George Patton (attached for St. Mihiel), and others.Every division should have a history of this quality.",1
"Nothing flowery is really necessary...: I'm listening to Xtina's album right now on Rhapsody and wanted to write a review. However, after reading a couple of glowing remarks wrought with flowery description, I realized the best way to sum it up is BUY IT! It's good music. There's really nothing more than that. Lyrically. Production-wise. It's better than anything else out. Christina Aguilera understands her voice better than anyone else, and it is a pleasure to hear what she hears in her head. It's absolutely breathtaking. She really respects you as a person to have put so much heart, soul, and care into two albums, equally amazing. For that alone, you have to buy this double CD. Just BUY IT! I'm ordering mine Friday...",1
Garbage for Chickenhawks: Probably enjoyable for those of you that are not brave enough to get your info from anything other than Faux News.Or for those of you in love with the boy president and his total screw up in Iraq.,0
"Excellent beginning and middle, no ending.: If I had written this review when I was even 1/2 or 3/4 way through it would have been a 4 or 5 star review. It starts fast and has a good premise, the ending though absolutely killed it for me. It completely leaves the reader hanging and doesn't resolve a single issue raised during the course of the book. It's like King hit the date for his deadline and just stopped writing.",0
"Good Guide: This seems extremely helpful (though I haven't taken the trip yet, so won't be sure for another couple of months). It has made planning my days in Budapest much easier and given me some insight into what to expect culturally.",1
"Bert Kaempfert's Christmas Wonderland is a must have!: Growing up, the Bert Kaempfert's Christmas Wonderland was (and still is) my all-time favorite Christmas album. I couldn't wait for the Holiday Season to begin just so my Dad would play it! I am so pleased to have found that it is available on CD!",1
"the right wing machine revs up: you'll notice a huge influx of one star reviews right around the the third week of septemeber, when hugo chavez gave this book it's second life by holding it up at the UN. this should show you two things. one, just how scared the far right is of chomsky. and two, just how ridiculously on message the right is. unfortunately that message is attack attack attack for anything threatening to it's own position. truth is, this is a tremendous book. chomsky is a rare intellect, both insightful and readable. the right doesn't want you to read this book... hence the organized attack against it. do yourself a favor though & pick it up. the ideas in this book are timely and important.",1
"""Lame Fame""!: This film left me longing for the original 1980 film starring Irene Cara. High expectations with such a great cast...too bad the film didnt deliver!",0
"Ok at best: Forced acting that didnt seem natural except the ""hippie"" dude, didnt much enjoy it. A few good undertones about the DEA and entire drug scene but otherwise poorly executed. I also really disliked the woman playing the main role.",0

"Classic HEAVY metal: This review will be to the point. This album was made back when sheer speed and horribly detuned guitars were NOT the norm. The ability for the musicians to play their chosen instruments well and the incredible COMPOSITIONS on this disc are what will keep me listening to this great album for many more years to come. King Diamonds voice is a little too much for a lot of folks, but if you want to hear songs that rival the compositions of band like Led Zepplin, but with a truly HEAVY sound, this album is a MUST HEAR!",1
"Not unique: I read the book - good advices there. But, please, safe your money. Because what they tell you is not new. The authors say: We have a unique approach for living a more fulfilled life. They haven't. Because you can found everything that they 'found out' in older philosophie - look at Tibet and elsewhere. So please buy another one or take the money and buy some flowers for the one you love.",0
"Sunshine Through the Window: The completion of a two-volume, chronological biography on one of the last century's most significant artists. Hilary Spurling writes with deep understanding and knowledge of Henri Matisse, his family, close helpers and models, and his color driven art.I found the author's treatment of key collectors to be of special interest, from the Russian Shchukin to Baltimore's Etta Cone. And the near mad Dr. Barnes of Merion, Pennsylvania.As a result of unconnected events -- the Russian revolution, the Nazi regime's hatred of modern art, and Dr. Barnes' seclusion of his vast collection -- many of Matisse's most important works were not available to the public and hence his full artistic record was generally unknown for many years.While I respect that this was a biography (it ends with the subject's death in 1954), an afterward on the state of Matisse's current reputation in the world of art would have been welcomed.",1
"Not good for the long run: We had the previous version of this program and when our updates subscription expired it generated a daily pop-up that interrupted (and stopped the functioning of) any program on the computer and indicated we needed to re-subscribe to the updates. I emailed Symantec who indicated there is no way to disable the pop-up without uninstalling the whole virus protection program. One must re-subscribe online or pay a higher cost to re-subscribe over the phone. Not a big problem as long as you plan to re-subscribe immediately, but really, really irritating if you take your time researching your purchases. I don't like supporting companies that are so manipulative; I hope this doesn't become the norm.",0
"great pictures, but faulty zoom: I loved the picture quality of this camera, but the first one I bought I returned after 3 months because the zoom wouldn't return..exchanged it thinking canon is a good product but the second did the same thing only just after a year and the warranty was void..I sent it to canon and explained but they refused to believe me and offered to fix it for $90.00...I will not buy canon products again.",0
"Heavy on Attitude -- light on Substance: ""Leaning into Six Sigma"" provides a few hours of entertaining reading, but only brushes the surface of Six Sigma. Written in the tradition of ""The Goal"" by Eliyahu Goldratt, ""Leaning into Six Sigma"" doesn't live up that book's success at explaining complex business/operations concepts even while telling a compelling story. While Sam Micawh, the protagonist, certainly can't be faulted for being boring, the brazen attitude bestowed upon her by the authors, and the patronizing tone with which the client company's employees are addressed, only serve to reinforce the negative stereotype of ""the arrogant consultant."" This fault makes me hesitant to recommend ""Leaning into Six Sigma"" ...",0
"Solid work.: In this film taking place during the recession, a sales executive loses his job, and struggles to accept the reality of his new lifestyle. Solid work here focuses not on the intricacies of what caused the financial meltdown, but instead presents the plight of one affected family. The movie also touches on the gap between compensation levels in the United States between the executives who run businesses and the people who ensure the companies function on a day-to-day basis. A strong cast ensures this film does not segue into sentimental tearjerker, though sentimentality does creep through a bit at the end. Overall, this is a strong effort that will capture the audience with solid acting and a compelling storyline.",1
"Avalon Organics Lavender Lotion: I had a horrible reaction to the NEW formula. Burning, redness, hot skin like a bad sunburn. Went away after a few hours but was quite painful. Used this lotion for years and had no problem. Wondering what went into the new formula that might have caused this. Has anyone else had similar experiences?",0
"Beware, faulty advertising about the DVD: I ordered this roller expecting a DVD but no DVD I called and they shipped me another roller with no DVD, then they wanted me to send the roller back and I told them since I never got my DVD I wouldn't be sending anything back, so they charged me for another roller and DVD. I am working with my credit card company to show just how crooked this place is. I wouldn't recommend buying anything from this company or Amazon again. They don't stand by their word.",0
"Pathetic: When Sheffield goes 0 for 4 with 3 ks against Schillingnext year the CHB will still find fault with something.Generally, there is a bias in hometown sports reporters,that's to be expected. However, he has a NEGATIVE bias!This just so his tired read can still be shilled.",0
This Album Overflows With...: Everything you need by Lonnie is right here on this CD! The group that put this collection of songs by Lonnie should be praised...they actually filled a CD with music that should be heard by the masses! It is rare to find an album so complete in style and context. Be excited when the UPS person delivers this one to your house!,1
"Good for the price: Got this product very soon (1 day) after I ordered it (although it is 2-day shipping). Spent several mins to figure out the right way to assemble it. But when it's done, it looks great! Very sturdy considering the price. I have a NP-30 which is very light but I think this stand will work for heavier digital pianos or keyboards. Also it is adjustable--which is very important! There are five different heights--I use the lowest one for sitting there and play, but if you want to stand and play no problem. Really fair price. Like it very much!",1
"Killing Zoe Great, yet One Question: I thouroughly enjoyed this film mainly because it is itensly raw or even 'pulp'. Hmmm I wonder why. For taking place in France (though it was filmed in Cali.) on Bastille Day and the never-boring heist genre I definately recommend it. I have ONE question though. Whats on the cover in his hand. In the movie he walks towards the screen and flicks something and it makes a small explosion. Is it a cigarette or is it a heroine-related hallucinations. It's as if Avary, Stoltz, Bender, and Tarantino are throwing a riddle in our faces. It reminds me of whats in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction. All-in-all, a great film.",1
Filter Coffe is Good Espresso is not so: I have previously owned a separate Krups Espresso machine and it made great espresso. This one doesn't. The problem is the amount of coffee you have to put in to make an espresso they say 2-4 cups but if you make two you cant compact the coffee unless your making for four so no crema ever :(. Filter coffee is fine and has a nice cut off feature when you take away the pot whilst coffee is being made. The build is not great and don't get the feeling its going to last that long...,0
"A fair album, but not representative of MMW potential: MMW are some of the best bands producing music today. Shackman was an incredible album. However, they lost it here. The record scratching DJ is like grafiti on the abilities of MMW. A true disappointment. GO BUY SHACKMAN!!!--a truly awesome MMW album.",0
"Marantz DV7001 DVD Player: I bought this DVD player thinking it was a step above the three Sony's I own. Not so, the sound goes out for 5 or 6 seconds at a time on all new DVD's. The picture blacks out for 6 or 7 seconds at a time on all new DVD's. The only thing it's good for is playing DVD's that I recorded, like old 70's movies. I looked in the manual and Marantz say's this is normal. The salesman at The Stereo Shop didn't mention this when I bought it. I sell TV's for a living and I will never recommend Marantz again.",0
DMX v.s. Kurupt: I was comparing this album too Kurupt's Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha. I found the Kurupt album to be much better than this. There are only a few tight joints on this album. Dmx has slipped since his 1st album. What's up with Dmx and Nas. They actually try to sing on a few of there tracks. What do you they think they can actually sing? Yeah right anyways. I exspected much more out of this album. Will DMX ever have another great album like It's Dark and Hell is Hot?,0
"Great Singer-Great Orchestra: Riddle and Ronstadt recorded these albums at a time when Nelson Riddle was nearing the end of his life. Linda knew it based upon the feeling that she puts forth in these standards. Riddle's arrangements are impeccable. He arranged beautifully for the string section but used some outstanding soloists in Bob Cooper (tenor), Plas Johnson,(tenor) Warren Luehning (trumpet) and Chancey Welch.(trombone) to embrace Linda's solos. Welch's solos are tastefully played with a smooth, mellow tone. He represents the epitome of an artist playing the trombone. This is a great album.",1
"Doesn't cover every tree...: Well written and arrived on time.There are a lot more tree species then what is shown in this book. Covers a lot, but not all.",1
"Faulkner's first published novel: Poetic and with an ""ackward lyricism"" (Weinstein, BECOMING FAULKNER). The novel more faithful to the naturalist-realist tradition Faulkner inherited--from Anderson, Dreiser, et al.--than other of his less accessible works. A fecundity of poetic description imbues the natural world with more life than some of the characters. ""A tree...turning upward its ceaseless white-bellied leaves, was a swirling silver veil stood on end, a fountain arrested forever; carven water.""",1
"Great voice lessons from a ""private teacher"": This is a great set. The book and CD are informative, helpful, and very down-to-earth. The CD is very encouraging, and enthusiastic. The excercises are the best method that I've seen to teach me how to breathe and sing in the middle and upper register of my voice properly. After I worked on the excercises for a few weeks, I successfully extended my useable range by several notes. I could sing tenor parts that I could never sing before, and I'm a pretty horrible baritone. Highly recommended.",1
video camera case: This is a very well made bag. It seems to hold all of your extra items like batteries and cables.,1
"Don't get too excited about this...: I know what you're thinking. SOTL and Labradford collaboration. Domination. The truth is - these songs are not bad by any means. They just cannot live up to the hype. Pretty flowing sounds and guitar parts shimmering throughout mediocre songs that evoke less emotion than the aforementioned bands generally exude. If you are a huge fan than go ahead and add it to your collection. If not, save your money and pick up something a little more cohesive...",0
"Russell sweats not what I expected: I ordered these because my husband always liked Russell Athletic clothing, however, these sweats are very thin and not like ones he has had before.I would not recommend them.",0
"This is worse than Moonraker, Living Daylights, and Licence to Kill: I rather watch the Moonraker, Living Daylights, and Licence to Kill. At least they are not a bunch of copycats from the previous bond films. Bronsas looks bored with the role and he is just doing it for a paycheck. The bond women in this film were not interesting and not very sexy at all. They were in the line of trying to dominate than anything. The actions is ok, but not great. The locations are excellent, that's what keeps this film interesting. Also, the greatest point and giving it two starts is that Madonna was in the film. I own this on DVD and I don't even hardly watch it. I am glad the Bronsan is retiring as bond, he is getting to old anyway. He was good in Goldeneye and lost interest in the other three.",0
"no information given about this product by amazon: This is not the scrabble game I was expecting.I bought it because of the raised grids, which it has. However it also has twice the number of spaces and letters. The board is much larger than the standard game.No such information was given by Amazon. I had to pay for return shipping which I did not appreciate. Be sure you understand what super deluxe means before you purchase this game.",0
"""Chuck"" Even Better 2nd Time Around: My family and I have gotten throught just 4 episodes of the 13-episode, 4-disc set of ""Chuck"" Season 1, and we are delighted with what we've seen. Although I saw the shows originally broadcast on TV, I find that I understand the plot better and catch the subtler jokes on rewatching. My family members who didn't see the show the first time around are laughing so hard we have to keep ""rewinding"" to pick up what we missed. Great family entertainment!",1
"Good product except freezed in a week: This's my first mp3 player. I purchase this one because it's the only flash memory based mp3 player that has bookmark capability. Listening to downloaded audio book is my main purpose.Menu is easy. Some functionalities need to read PC installed manual to figure out, such as how to setup bookmark.Problem is it stops working yesterday, five days after I bought it. First it froze, no button works. It recovered after I pushed reset button using a pin. In a few hours, it froze again. This time, reset is not able to bring it back. As soon as the screen is on, it froze, no matter how many times I tried. The thing I did yesterday is loading about 2G music into the player. It might have some issue when loaded with too much music, but, hey, it's a 4G player.",0
"yes!: So far, so good! I've part these up with some protective tape and have had no problem. Maybe a lil extra weight with the tape but no biggie. I ordered an extra set since I've had a hard time finding these at the store (they're always running out).",1
"Okay for beginners, but there is no challenge: I was very disappointed with this video. It was far too easy and did not seem like pilates at all. I liked Jennifer Kries' Method Precision toning much better, although that one is more of a relaxation tape. I will continue searching for a better pilates video!",0
"Great take on unlikely standards...: Gelfand and his acolytes make solid and original jazz out of music usually associated with children. These arrangements are simply delightful, my favorite being ""Passe-Partout"" a theme I knew by heart as a 4-year-old in '78. Gelfand not only arranges the themes well, his interpretations and solos on the piano shows that they could have a great new life as jazz!",1
"Good deal, solid product.: Good deal, solid product. You would be crazy to buy cables at a retail store. You pay 8-10x the price for the SAME product.",1
"Different breed of cat: Just brewed my 1st cup of coffee with the Brew Central DCC-1200.Before my purchase through Amazon I read all 58 reviews of this product and was concerned about the 50-50 division of opinion on the quality of the brew, whether it was hot enough (I need it hot), and the water mess on the counter when the cover was raised. I should add that I recently purchased and returned a Krups (great coffee but a clunker for endurance--froze up twice after a few months operation) and Capresso (dull, undrinkable coffee).My empiracle assessment of the DCC-1200 is that:1. The brew is superior;2. It is hot--can't see how it could be hotter;3. A plastic lip connected to the reservoir cover on the back of the machine catches any condensation runoff when the cover is raised.",1
"Love and Selfishness Can Not Coexist!: This is not a love story. It is a story of two selfish people who don't know what real love is. They put their own interest above the others. Most romantic movies ignore the fact that the feeling that comes with ""falling in love"", is not real love and is always temporary. In this movie it is clear from the tortured existence the characters choose to live, real love is something they have not yet been willing to give, and probably don't even understand. Even in the end it seems the only thing that brought them together was their selfish desires to regain that fleeting feeling that comes with falling in love, never learning how to truly love.",0
A CHILDHOOD FAVORITE THAT MY DAUGHTER ALSO LOVES: I RECEIVED THE DVD QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS MOVIE AS MUCH AS I DID WHEN I WAS HER AGE.,1
Facinating: This book is a much needed new insight on Dominican Republic where I travelled a lot a few years ago. It is very interesting situation with haiti and the author adresses cultural issues sensitively but informatively. The book is very easily to read and has a good order.,1
"The Luxury of Privacy: As our camping crew gets larger and more diverse , We have found that privacy is a luxury some hold onto the most. I recieved my shower tent this afternoon and of course had to set it up.I have found that this shower tent has all the features we need and more. I'm sure it will prove to be a good investment when that August camping trip to the Blackrock Desert in Nevada, comes around. It feels big enough to put a tub into, but then that really would'nt be roughing it.",1
"Forget it!!: If you are ordering this for a Toyota Rav 4, forget it. It is not the right one, in spite of the ads. Useless!!",0
Good book: I looked at several spanish books from my local library before I selected this one. Good price too.,1
"Half Baked Pie: First the disclaimer, perhaps being English so no high school or prom night and being the wrong side of 30 I missed the point but a lot of this I had already seen in the 80's in Porky's and Lemon Popsicle etc. The story is simple. 4 guys agree to lose their virginity by prom night. Hence lots of trying too hard and lots of failure. The funny parts were laugh out loud funny admittedly. The father explaining the art of masturbation to his horrified son and the guy referring to a sex bible whist the girl is unaware were extremely clever. I am not sure that the supposed tender scenes and realisation that sex is well just sex really worked in a teenage movie. But judging from the reviews and sales I am in a minority but there were just too many unfunny moments.",0
"Worst electronic product I ever had / Porcaria de Marca!!!!: There should be a -5 star option... I would have chosen it.Connections via wi-fi drops all the time. I have a WGT624 and a WGT634. Both get stuck on the wi-fi all day. I need to unplug it from the wall to return it to a working condition. I have tried all availables upgrades and made a lot of ""Downgrade"" to try it out and after reading a lot of reviews and forums I have found out that NETGEAR does not work at all. Please do a favor to you. DO NOT BUY NETGEAR. I am trowing away my WGT 624, 634 and MP101 and will only buy d-link or linksys in the future. Stupid option I made choosing Netgear... Nao recomendo nada da Netgear. Eu comprei diversos equipamentos deles e NENHUM funcionou direito. Recomendo que comprem Linksys ou D-link se nao quiserem ter a dor de cabeca que eu tive.",0

"Ghibi studios has outdone themselves.: Spirited Away is a beautifully drawn, anitimated, and plot out story about a young girl, Chihiro, who at the beginning is a tad bit whiny and spoiled. But as the movie progresses you see Chihiro, now named Sen, become more mature. It's a wonderful movie about, I believe, responsibility and love. I think Disney did a fine job dubbing it, as they have with the other movies by this same person. Grant you, I was disappointed in the ending, but if any of you remember Princess Mononoke it too had an ending like this. It leaves viewers to come up with their own idea as to what happened after the movie ended.",1
I don't think so..: DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no picture... no exact illustration... And... the worst thing is we should get the other skate(you may be able to use your inlineskate on some skiils) has 4 wheels and 1 small wheel.,0
"This is the secret...: If you do not understand what is authentic, you will be fooled by counterfeits.Get this book, read it, study it, and tell everyone you know about it.This book is powerful information that ALL Christians need to learn, know, and understand. He quotes scriptures to build his points and sheds light on the battle plans and tactics of the devil. it is a quick read, great stuff. Powerful information for the beginner Christian to protect themselves in the spiritual battle that we are in every day.God Bless",1
"Great Customer Service: I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she's used it a fair amount in the few weeks since. The packaging and organization are excellent. The machine itself is heavy and well put together. Our only complaint is that when slicing potatoes the other day (with the larger slicer), somehow the slicer tilted too much sending the blade up into the lid--it dug into the plastic for 1/2 a turn and rested slightly outside the top of the lid! This obviously ruined both the lid and the slider, not to mention causing no small consternation on my wife's part. We called KitchenAid's 800 number for service and were helped immediately. They are sending a new slicer and lid free of charge (of course) and we expect it to arrive here shortly. If the problem reoccurs we'll be selecting a different model/brand. Otherwise the 760 has been great.",1
"Boring, dry, and uninformative: This book is boring, boring, boring. It's as boring as its title. Additionally, the book is simply not informative. I bought it expecting real-world stories from the trenches. What I got was a rehash of the BOL (Books Online) with no real DBA advice. I'm very sorry I bought this book and intend to return it.",0
"Not what is represented: This is a fine film about running breaking seas over inlet bars in planing boats. If it were marketed as such, I would give it four stars. It is NOT about heavy weather boat handling. If you think this dvd will help teach you to survive bad weather at sea while cruising offshore, as the title and description suggest, you will be disapointed. If you want to learn to safely cross a breaking bar in small-medium size outboard skiffs and power catamarans, you will enjoy this dvd, in the unlikely event that you order it, given the misleading title.",0
"Win!: Another win for Stephen King! I know I'm twenty-odd years late in saying that, but hey, there's a time and a place for every book, and 'It's time was now.Great rendering of childhood nostalgia -- even if I didn't grow up in the late 50's. This is the first time in a long time that a book has actually frightened me a little bit. I like to read in the bath, but after the scene in Beverly's bathroom -- I actually had second thoughts.Fantastic fantastic. Long but completely worth it.",1
"I Love It!!!!!: I purchased this dvd after watching the BARKAYS on Unsung. I always loved the Barkays music. I see them everytime they come in concert in Phoenix. The music is so good that I can hardly drive to work, because I can to pull over and dance in the streets.",1
"Move it on over: Good book about the life of legendary country singer Hank Williams. Booze, wrong women (mother and wife) but great songs. Book is easy to read.Some minor complaints: no index and no sources so virtually unusable for more scientific research",1
"low profile?: Don't be misled, this is NOT a low profile cap! I have a standard cap just like it so was excited to find a low profile cap in the same design. Pictures can be misleading but if you look closely you can see that the had is standard not low profile. Robert is disapointed!",0
"Nice concept but useless: The color screen and keyboard are nice, functional and a big improvement over the classic palm(although the keyboard implementation works somewhat better on the blackberry because a trackwheel lets you keep your thumbs on the keyboard, while the Treo still requires occasional use of a stylus). Unfortunately, the battery life is abysmal. Handspring claims the batteries are sufficient for 10-days of normal use. My experience is that I'm lucky if I can get a day and a half, and I'm by no means a power user (I can go two weeks on my Palm V). Not terribly useful for a three day road trip. I'd stay away from the Treo if you travel, or are away from a charge more than every couple of days (or don't want to carry cables).",0
"skip it: I used the machine for 45 minutes straight and did not feel any soreness the next day as if I had done any type of core exercise. Sorry, but I sent it back.",0
A book to share: Grave's End: A True Ghost Story was a riveting tale. It speaks of true to life experiences with something that is not what is thought of as common occurrence and have no idea as to the cause of the happenings. It shows how easy it would be to wonder about one's mental health. A great read for all who like ghost stories and also a training reference if you are into paranormal pursuits.,0
"Good, but ...: Not what I was expecting from this kind of movies. My honest opinion is to consider not buying this movie and try to find it free on the Web, since you will see this one not more than once (if you dare ...).",0
"Excellent Guide for Turbine Transition: I've started with my jet transition training even before this book was delivered to me; I could truly say that ""The Turbine Pilot's Flight Manual"" is an excellent supplement to study materials and aircraft flight manuals given in training. This book gives a detailed explanation of the logic behind turbine aircraft systems, and discusses them in a very easy to understand manner; excellent for beginners and those transitioning to advanced systems. I would highly recommend this book, along with another book published by ASA: ""Fly the Wing,"" which in turn discusses the flight procedures in a turbine aircraft.",1
"This is digusting !!!: Just when I thought Kidz Bop was as bad as it could get, DJ kid proved me wrong. now, I know this is aimed at younger kids, but its still pathetic. I srtongly reccomend ""Disneymania"" for fans of hip,bouncy songs....by singers who can actually SING !!!",0
"Fluffy: The novel was originally serial fiction. When it was compiled for the novel, it remained something light and mildly amusing for the coffee and crumpet reader.",0
"Delta Wedding: I had always wanted to read something by Eudora Welty, and this book cured me of that. What a confusing bunch of characters--one didn't know if they were white or black--young or old. The one bright spot in the book was her very descriptive language.",0
"Not much stretching, too much new age.: I have health conditions which make it hard to exercise fully during my pregnancy. I thought a prenatal yoga would be a good way to do some safe stretching and be a little less active than full out aerobic exercise. It had all this chanting and talk of birthing your baby in a rain forest like women hundreds of years ago, and then it seemed to mix yoga with lots of repetitions so it was more like a fast paced yoga aerobic workout. This would be great for those who like new age aerobic exercise yoga.",0
"A great collection - long out of print.: ""The Big Book of Plays"" is the first of two books put out by the legendary comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre (Phil Austin, Peter Bergman, Philip Proctor, and David Ossman) during their heyday (it was published in 1972). It is a collection of pieces from the troupe's first four albums. As such, it allows the reader to finally fully penetrate the oft-times impenetrable texts of the group's records. The pieces included are ""Waiting For the Electrician or Someone Like Him"" and ""How Can You Be In Two Places At Once When You're Not Anywhere At All?"" from the albums of the same name, and the titles ""Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers"" and ""I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus"" in their entirety. The plays are accompanied by a plethora of photos, a foreword from each member, and a chronology of the group's career to that point. Good luck finding a copy but, if you do, grab it! It's great.",1
"100 Birds and How They Got Their Names: I purchased this book because I had been given and read 100 Flowers and How They Got Their Names by the same author, Diana Wells. This book was as enjoyable as the one on flowers. The pen and ink illustrations and the descriptions are accurate and, as the book jacket states, the author ""has a remarkable ability to dig up the curious and the captivating"". A fun read.",1
"A quick, fun read!: I am not a morning person... but I have to give this book a lot of credit. I actually laughed out loud while reading this book at 6 in the morning. I never do that! It is a fun read! If you want a lot of depth, not going to happen... but I love the humor! So yes, I am going to continue to read her books. Thanks Ms. Bond for the entertainment!",1
New Kindle: I ordered a new Kindle for my mother-in-law for Christmas. It was missing the power adapter to charge it. It will not charge via the USB port on my computer. This stinks because now I have to pay additional money to buy an adapter and she can't use it until it comes.,0
"DID NOT LAST 3 WEEKS: This product did not last longer the 2 weeks and stopped working. I am extremely disappointed and will never order from Margin Mart Inc through Amazon.com again. They want my now to pay to return the defective item at my expense.This is unacceptable. I knew the item was inexpensive compared to going directly to Sony but it was not worth the $, headache or time spent.I do not recommend anyone purchasing even though the product price is soo low.",0
"Didj done good!: If the didjeridoo is a favorite of yours, this CD will not fail to delight you. This CD feature eclectic as well as traditional styles of music. David Hudson's didjeridoo work is fabulous, especially in 'Animal Imitations...' and 'The Hunt.' A more informative jacket would give an extra star, but does not detract from the quality of the music. This is a must for anyone who loves the didj as well as good Yolngu music.",1
"Best movie of the year so far: Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton have both acted their guts out in this movie. It was hilarious from start to finish, with a brilliant, non-cheezy ending to match. When you start off this movie you think you know how it ends, but you don't! Anyway, that aside, the acting by all of the characters, Cate Blanchett included was brilliant, and the story line was intelligent funny, and kept you hooked all the way thru. Plus, I think I'm in love with Cate Blanchett after this movie. She was just brilliant too. The funniest robber movie I've seen in a long time.",1
He's done better work: I watched the TV special and was sorely disappointed. I have loved all of his earlier works but the Minding the Monsters show was all about hating the ex-wife. He's said some very typical ex-wife stuff before but not to this level. The shows staging was very cool and Peanuts entrance was the best. But that was the show. I remember laughing out loud just once. He definitely needs to go back to the beginnings when he was funny. I hope he turns it around. Glad I did not purchase the DVD.,0
"Heart Drenched...: To even read a review of this album would put me to tears. No words could do justice to their magnificence in this album and their interpretation of their world and the people around them. It's abstract and put togther at the same time. Although, what they have done, is made this feeling global to anyone anywhere in the world. This will bring you closer to your feelings, yourself, the world, and your heart. This album, beginning with track 1, will stop your heart, flood it, and flood your thoughts.",1
"Good read: From all the reviews I expected one of the great horror novels and while this is a good novel, I dont think its great. Part of the problem, at least for me, is I guessed very early on in the novel the big ending. I have never seen the movie and Im not claiming Im the most perceptive reader in the world but the author gives very obvious hints, expecially the name of the client, throughout and the ending wasnt so shocking, at least not to me.Its well written from a first person POV, the descriptions of 1959 New York put you there and I thought the characters were nicely drawn. There were some surprises and it was a fairly quick read but the big payoff at the end was the payoff I expected so it wasnt as powerful.Definitely worth the read, though.",1
This toy is AWSOME!: Even thoe I do not have Crumplezone I KNOW he is awsome!Out of all the transformers he is the cooliest. My friend Cam got his and he showed me all the features. I love the deatails even thoe his is head is shaped like dinobot's transmetal one.,1
"Intelligent & Sesitive Operatic Realism: I have nothing but the highest praise for every aspect of this production. All of the roles, even the minor ones, are perfectly realized and limned with the greatest artistic skill and sensitivity that I've encountered in an opera performance in a very long time. My eyes literally became moist many times during the course of this extremely creative production. The vocalism, conducting, and musicianship of all involved are intensely beautiful. The production values, sets and costumes are of the highest achievement and Puccini's music has to be some of the most sublime he has written. Vocalists Voigt, Gallo and Giordani and Maestro Luisotti are triumphant.",1
A must have!: I bought 5 books on the subject of essential oils. This was by far the best. Valerie Ann Worwood is very concise and offers a blend for just about anything you might need...and then some. It is fabulous! Highly reccomend.,1
"Terrific: Read it !! It will take your breath away at the end , don't read to many reviews about the book as the last pages make the entire book worth it , not sure how they will make it into a movie but I'll be sure to see it",1
"Are you really a follower of Christ?: ""When Christ calls a man, He bids him come and die"". These words of Bonhoeffer are the grand theme of this miraculous theological work. This books calls upon every professed or confessed believer in Christ to examine him or herself. Bonhoeffer pulls no punches, and he has every right to do so. Focusing on the ""sermon on the mount"" Bonhoeffer calls on every christian not to just hear the sayings of Christ but to do them! There are few writers who can truly bring us into the presence of Christ, and this is what Bonhoeffer does in ""The Cost of Discipleship"".In these times of false teachings and ""cheap grace"" as Bonhoeffer puts it, this is a wakeup call for all christians. Certainly the greatest book I have read on what it means to be a follower of Christ.",1
Unrealistic and dull: This book is overly sentimental and maudlin. Hardly anything bad happens to the main character after the first few chapters. I REALLY wanted him to die! And now there's a sequel! NOOO!!,0
this turbine is not built well: received this turbine and installed on roof. flimsy construction. once installed it started squeaking. a good wind would bend it. the sellers were fantastic to work with. gave me credit back for its return. but the product itself? bad--flimsy--noisy--cheaply made. stay away from this one.,0
"There are better movies out there!: This story has been told and told and told. It's known to every comic book kid in the world. The beginning of the Earther Green Lantern. It was just recently re-re-redone in animation, full length feature film only about two years or so ago and now we get to see the same, identical movie done with real life actors using CG instead of animation... oh boy, I can't wait to read The Hobbit again, for the 27th time... Couldn't Hollywood use SOME OTHER STORYLINE for once?!",0
Lacks depth: Book does not convey information in a concise way. Quite voluminous book with no depth. Definitely not a good book for any level of programmers.,0
"A great collection of spoilers: This book doubtless has some good things in it, but it also includes a host of one-page synopses of great works---sort of a Cliff Notes of the Cliff Notes---which generally miss the point but never miss a spoiler. I feel bad for the person who stumbles across these and, in reading them, ruins the experience of reading the book synopsized for themselves for the first time. This is a terrible book.",0
This lounger worked great.: We ordered these to take with us on a houseboat trip to Tennessee. They worked out so great. You blow them up and you are ready to go. We floated in these for 7 days straight and loved them.,1
"Easy read and full of information: Vera Alder does an amazing job taking rather complex esoteric subject matter and making it easy to understand for the those new to these studies. It's clear she has a deep and accurate understanding of the subject matter and covers much in this book.Thanks Vera, wherever you are!",1
Pitch Black: I love these movies but they need to release all 4 of the movies. Few people know that before Pitch Black came out an Hour long movie called Into Pitch Black came out explaining how Riddick escaped Slam City!,1
"unimpressed: I found this book to be very unimpressive. I know that it's supposed to be this great allegory and whatnot, but they story was mediocre and the ending, well I'm not sure that I'd call it an ending. In fact, I'm still not sure of what exactly happened at the end. Perhaps if I had read a better edition than the one I did, it would have explained it for me. Maybe I'm too dense for this book.",0
"SCARY!: I found this book offering a somewhat scary look at society. Golding seems to think that without society men are just in need of violence and sex, and the book totally forgets about women. I did not care for this book, and found it somewhat hard to follow.",0
"Wish I'd bought one decades ago!: FINALLY purchased a stand mixer with a 3 piece pasta attachment kit and I am pleased. I hesitated always because of price, how much space it would take up and how to decide on the size of machine. I have a small kitchen and always talked myself out of it until my remodel. Now with more storage space I splurged and bought a big one. My only complaint WOULD have been that it may not work as well on a small batch of dough as a smaller bowl would and then I found out today I can purchase a 3 qt bowl and whip to use as well! I'm thrilled and wish I'd purchased this years ago. I used the sheet roller pasta attachment for ravioli and it was fun and not too hard. However, don't do as the instruction book says - it suggests that you roll to 4 or 5. That is way too thick for ravioli, so do roll it to the thinnest for ravioli. Downside: really big and really heavy.",1
Oh my Gosh!: Only tasteless people would buy this garbage! Look at its ranking! Its a really bad CD! Really Bad!,0
Comfort that is Champion: Champion jersey shorts are very nice and cool. The shorts are good for working out or relaxing at home.,1
"great Christmas music, but depressing at times: Most of the songs are good renditions of popular Jul songs, but I find the organ instrumentals depressing and too church-like. If those songs were happier and joyous sounding, I would have rated this a 5.",1
Everything You Need To Know About Wine: What a great book! This book teaches you as much or as little as you want to know about wine. It takes the confusion out of tasting new wines and shopping for wine is now fun. You could study it like a textbook and become well versed in the subject or learn what you need to know to make drinking wine more enjoyable.,1
"First book I probably will burn: Highly regret my impulsive buy; I usually read reviews before getting something. Although revised from 20 yrs ago it still reads from that era; very much like my mother's romance books I would sneak under my bed covers to read as a teen- like old fashion women were slaves to their ""desires"" without a lick of sense. I'm a nurse with experience in rape situations, and it should not be condoned or written as excusable/forgettable. Coulter obviously has no experience in how survivors of rapists would feel and subsequently leaves me as the reader feeling dirtied to have even finished the book. First and last book I'll read from her.",0
"Army tanks do not belong in a fantasy world!!!!!: Read the first two books and then make up your own ending.If you read this book, it will ruin the first two for you.So resist the temptation.The merging of the modern world into an imaginary fantasy world should never happen, yet the authors try to do this.Why? Why ruin such a great story?",0
"Virtually useless: I have had this dictionary about a week. I am studying Spanish every day and only find about 1 out of 5 words I try to look up.I was just doing an exercise and after looking up 5 words (Spanish to English) without finding any of them, I decided to write this review.For me this dictionary is worthless. I wasted my money.",0
"Worst. Popcorn. Popper. Ever.: I've decided recently to not eat microwave popcorn (too salty and buttery to me) and went back to popping it on the stove top. Not wanting to needlessly put wear and tear on my ceramic stove, I purchased this popper.First time I used it the popcorn was tough to chew. The whole thing was a pain in the butt to clean also, I mean why make the bowl so intricate? It's like cleaning a bundt pan each time you want popcorn!I use powdered seasoning and it all goes on the sides of the bowl instead of the popcorn. I even tried transferring it to another bowl and putting the seasoning on that way - still went everywhere but the popcorn.I just popped some on the stove, and it's delish! This popper is going back. For $[...], I expected way more than what Cuisinart delivered.",0
"schwinn 213 as good as i thought it would be: My Scwhinn 213 arrived in a reasonable amount of time with the free delivery. Putting it together had a few snags, the worst being that wires to the heart monitor were inadvertently cut by my husband. They were wrapped in plastic and then in tape and he didn't know there were wires inside and cut through the tape. Luckily he was able to fix that. Once put together, the bike is great. I wondered if the recumbent would give you enough of a workout - it does. I've tried several of the programs it has and they are all good, some easier than others (depending on the level you choose) which I like. I don't always feel like a really hard workout. I think it is a good piece of equipment and would recommend it.",1
"Not impressed and I'm an easy movie critic: Plot was silly with holes galore! Woody is practically in the whole movie, and is annoying at best. My wife & I were rolling our eyes during a majority of the movie. The movie completely wasted the talents of Hugh Jackman. Hugh Jackman & Scarlett have absolutley no chemistry in the film. The movie was pretty much a waste of time.",0
"Not good for carpets -- okay for hardwood and linoleum: I too bought this through QVC for a cheaper price. What caused me to return it is the countless times I ran it over the same area (on 1/2"" carpeting) to pick up things it missed. On smooth surfaces (linoleum) it seemed more effective -- but this wasn't an economical replacement for my $5 Swiffer. Although it was fun to watch as it ran, I had to follow it around because it would get stuck under the couch and in corners (it shuts down after a few attempts to reposition itself). It's a fun novelty item but should not be considered a serious cleaning machine. If you do decide to get this, don't throw out your old vacuum -- you'll need it.",0
"very pretty, but cheaply made: I was very pleased with the physical quality. I thought it was a great buy until I took it off my ear and one of them broke off the chain. :(",0
"Doesn't leave a good impression.: Mean Girls starring Lindsay Lohan is just plain mean of course. Lohan brings nothing exciting to the role but Rachel McAdams is so good in this film, you actually believes she is a self-centered, heartless little witch. The begining is pretty good but by the middle you start to care less about the characters and their so-called dilemmas. The ending is just awful, so I have to admit that Mean Girls was a waste of time. Skip it. Kinda surprised this film average customer rating is 5 stars! Give me a break people, it's not oscar-worthy.",0
"Great way to learn php and mysql: Andy Harris has written a gem of a book. He is clearly an educator who has thought about how to teach programming. This book takes you step by step through php, introducing excellent examples and adding to them as the book moves along. This is a good text to use as an instructor or it would be great for self study. Clearly the best beginning book on the subject.While the book covers php and mysql from the beginning, it would help if the reader had a background in html, css and some programming.",1
Enjoyed this since it first came out in the 1980's: I have enjoyed this book and it's version of Klingon culture since reading it in high school and as a basis for the FASA Star Trek role playing game. This is what Klingons should be.,1
"Not impressed: Given by two Australians in a room with bad acustics and a cheesy sign as a backdrop. The material is OK, but better, more through lessions can be found for free on line. Don't waste your money.",0
book: was exactly as pictured. this was a gift for my mother-in-law & she loved them. Would recommend this to anyone.,1
"a highly overlooked cd: I am a 30-year old music lover who did not expect to like this cd. I heard the song ""This Time Around"" on MuchMusic and based on that one song bought the album. All the songs are very good - unlike anything i was hearing on the radio which bored me. ""Wish that I was There"" is a ""hit repeat"" melody - i love all the rhythms. Their harmonies are a delight and the themes are poignant. Ignore the sales charts and ignorant teeny-bopper, bubble gum descriptions of the band and take a listen for yourself. Trust me. :)",1
"Awesome puzzle!: Melissa & Doug have done it again. My daughter is only 10 months old and she LOVES this puzzle. It is extremely durable, as she loves to bang the pieces on the board and the paint has not chipped once. Even tho she doesn't ""get it"" yet, she likes when I play with her and talk about each shape and color. If this puzzle is on the floor, it is usually the very first thing she crawls too. I highly recommend it! You and your child will not be disappointed!",1
"Stick with the Maniacs: I'm a big Natalie fan, but not a fanatic. The DVD didn't do much for me. i bought it after listening to the Live CD, but was disappointed that the playlist didn't include anything more of substance. The documentry consisted of all of 5 minutes of people in line for the show. Life is sweet was audio only, Waterbound, Senor don gato were awful, and anyone who was a 10000 manics fan would not enjoy her drawn out these are days.Stick with the **** MTV Unplugged - 10k maniacs video...a far better value.The whole setlist:List is sweet(partial), Opheilia, wonder, san andres fault, beloved wife, senor don gato, space oddity, carnival, break your heart, these are days, gulf of araby, waterbound.",0
"So-So CD: This CD has all of the good songs, sure, but it's makes a whole lot of difference to hear them on the original albums, the way the beatles wanted them. Just warning you!!",0
"The Best Keeps Getting Better!: This version has a plethora of new features. The most important of which (for me, anyway) is the ability to convert .pdf documents to rich text format (RTF) for editing in one's favorite word processor. So far, this feature seems to work nearly flawlessly. If you have to generate simple or complex electronic documents then you should not be without this program. The ubiquitous avialablity of Adobe Reader means that the people to which you send your documents will always be able to open them. I know people that won't use MS-Word, but I don't know anyone without Adobe Reader so you won't go wrong in using Adobe for your document generation.",1
"Booorringggg...: Almost impossible to read. The History Of Everything: history of software languages, history of computers, history of programming, objects, and such. Here and there a bit of pseudophilosophical gravy. The essence: screwed up project, because bunch of gurus selected wrong tools as well as didn't know how to plan and execute the project. All the essence would fit into 20-40 pages, and such document woud be interesting. I gave up just around page 200, completely lacking interest what is on remaining 200 pages. Pretty likely will be send back to Amazon",0
"The best song in the movie is missing: How come ""Blind"" by Korn was played partially two times during the movie yet it isn't on the soundtrack? That's a shame, cause it's the only good song in the entire movie.",0
"Ridicules: This movie is an outrage!!!!!!!!! Bad lines, stupid actors and gory love sceans. If you have bad taste for movies, go see this one!!",0
First Wives Club/Sliding Doors: DVD arrived on time. I haven't watched it yet but it looks like it's in good condition.,1
"If you are going to buy it, do not get it from ChiTek!!!!: I am 100% sure that this product is excellent, but please do not buy it from ChiTek. You will be better of buying it from another seller. There are many sellers on Amazon selling this same product and even at cheaper prices. I had a very bad experience with this seller, they mess up with my order, charge me for it and I never received the item because they wrote a wrong address on the item box, when they obtained my address from Amazon records??? And after they realiced they made a mistake they cancelled my order and did not enven told me about it. Just don't buy it from ChiTek.",0
"Great to entertain: I bought this for my daughter, who at the time was 4-1/2. She liked it but required help with learning how to move. As she got older & used to it she enjoyed it quite a bit, she even still pulls it out on occasion. The only down side was with the system itself as it requires a VERY WELL LIT room to function properly.",1
"A must have so you can get things done: I love our baby bjorn, there are some days when our son just wants to be held. So, put the baby in the carrier and you can still get stuff done. Its also helpful while shopping since your hands are free. The only downside is that if you are busty its not always comfortable. But, its still a great item to have.",1
Want to charge for technical questions even before I install: This company wants you to call a 900 number or provide a credit card for billing for even answering questions about their software. Does that sound like a company you want to deal with? If you find this too hard to believe just call with a technical question and see what happens.,0
"Love this book: I received this book as a gift several years ago and now I buy it anytime I need a fun gift for someone. Some of the recipes aren't traditional, but yummy just the same!",1
Weak!: This album is weak - sorry to dissapoint the fans...such as myself - who loved the powerful hard energy that the first two albums had....This album is soft. My best analogy if how Limp Bizkit was hella hard and awesome on their first album (3 Dollar Bill Yall) to the weakness of their latest album....Thats all I gotta say..I wanted this CD to pump me up like the older ones. But that didnt happen.This album is definetely not worth the 11 bucks I payed for it...If you want something hard more 'like' the old Slipknot then go buy KORN's 'Take a Look In the Mirror' CD! Thats a f...in awesome CD.,0
"Where's Crib Death, Slug Froma45? ICP you failed me!: A great diservice to a deserving artist. While this had about 12 or 13 good songs on it, I could have did without Jays corny ass interludes. I also felt better songs could have been on here. The best thing about this cd is the album art. I'm giving it a 2 based on the album art and the dozen or so songs that I own on cd anyways.",0
"These are Awesome!: I am so sick of the bright colored erasers you get at Wal-mart. I bought these and love them. They fit snugly on the pencil and are rigid enough to actually erase. I took some to the school where I work and my students now ask for a pencil with one on it. I have not seen a good eraser like this in years. You might think I am a bit weird to get so excited about an eraser, but if you are sick of the cheap ones, you will love these.",1
"I read this book for school: I read Like Water for Chocolate for my summer reading project for school. I felt that I could not really get into it and see myself as the characters. That is mostly because, to me the setting was too fake. Maybe it is the way it was done a long time ago, but I have never heard of someone marrying somone's sister to be closer to them. It may also be the fact that I am a guy but to me this book was just boring.",0
I quote it constantly: Can't stop talking about this show. More people should embrace the crazy antics of this functionally dysfunctional group of friends,1
"Excellent choice: So far, the iron has worked very well. Does not make water marks on clothes. Not sure whether it has an ""off"" button, but have been unplugging it after each use. Nice point to get in between buttons.",1
WORTH EVERY CENT!!!!!!: This is the best breakdancing video that i have come across. It's step by step instructions. They show you that right way and wrong way of doing moves. BUY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO BREAKDANCE THE RIGHT WAY.,1
"putty: This stuff is messy, and tacky looking. Not what I thought it would be. Quake Secure is much better (Safe-t-proof) sells this product. I have paranoid parents and they are earthquake, fire, everything prepared and we get our stuff from safe-t-proof",0
"Informative: Good historical/cultural overview of the New Testament and related texts. Relates mysticism and historic reality. I would not describe it as a ""thrilling text"" but very educational.",1
"Good Sword: Was shipped very quickly (without next day) great condition, solid, will buy from seller again.",1
Good book: Wonderful book very creative It has a good start with action and tells you of Little Han Solo's past and when he yelled at the droid Amazingly funny If you have read other books with han in them you'll see why,1
"Fast relief from UTI's: Just taking two tablets at the first sign of UTI provided relief for me within an hour. No more waiting to get into the doctor for a prescription for antibiotics, the price of them and the worry of antibiotic overuse.",1
"Super Funny!!: If your not into just stupid humor you won't like this. But if your looking for something to just sit down and veg to, you'll love this flick. Cameron Diaz, JT, and Jason Segel all play well off of each other. Some calm moments but most of it's over the top and just laugh your a$$ off.",1
"Be Aware of Fake Chi on Amazon.com: I bought Chi on Amazon.com from the seller ""Salon Products"". BE AWARE of this seller! They sell FAKE CHI!! It broke down in 5 month, so I sent it back to manufacture for repair because Chi has a year warranty, but they sent it back to me and said that the item is not authentic so they don't fix it. Company said they don't sell their product on line at all!! (They have a new policy that they don't repair the product if it's purchased online, but the company was very nice about it and they did investigation on my Chi to see if I got fake or not!!) I would NEVER BUY CHI ONLINE again. I had been using chi purchased in beauty shop until it got some connection problems, and it worked Great and lasted 5-6 years. Chi is a great hair iron but Never buy it online. You end up waste your money even you think you are getting a good deal.",0
"Cheap in cost and construction: I'm very surprised in the number of positive reviews for this item. When I received it, I was disappointed in the light weight of the tamper. I want a tamper with some backbone that will stay put as I tamp the grind. It also has an obviously plated surface, which concerns me. After a few months of weekend use, I now see small flakes of the plating coming off. Who knows what shape it would be in if I had washed it in the dishwasher (see other reviews).SO...so long, cheap tamper. I'm going for one that is solid stainless steel with no potentially lead-ladened plating and has a more comfortable grip. This one is barely tolerable.If you spent good money on an espresso machine, don't cheap out on the tamper. You'll be disappointed in this one.",0
"The Horses of Proud Spirit: I absolutely loved this book. I went through a lot of Kleenex. The book is very well-written. It is a quick read if you want, but it really makes you stop and think, laugh, cry. It's amazing that people who have no knowledge of horses get them and then don't know what to do with them. Melanie cries right along with the reader. I'm glad that she has rescued these proud animals and given their lives back to them. I liked the pictures she had in the book, and I'm trying to get the DVD of the horse operation based on the book. I'm also trying to get PBS to show it here.I'm now reading the sequel book called Hoof Prints, and it is every bit as good as The Horses of Proud Spirit. Thanks, Melanie.",1
"Good Buy: The MP3 player I received was different from the one pictured. I was disappointed, but the model I received was a newer model and a better player.",1
"Schlockberg, all rights reserved: This movie intellectual level doesn't surpass the one of a third grader. Characters are all one dimensional. Scripting is higly predictable and filled with clichees. As about all S. movies, this also preaches its number of PC ""valueable lessons"". The most common: accept and sustain difference (aliens vs. humans or humans vs. humans). What a repugnant propagandistic piece of ....",0
Great movie not so happy with the disk itself: So as not to mislead anyone my five star rating is for the movie itself. Anyone familiar with this movie already knows how great it is so I am not about to review it. As for the disk itself why is the movie on both sides? Maybe I'm just being picky here buy why do I have to flip the disk over to see side two? My fault for not noticing that when I placed the order but still these days no movies come loaded on both sides of a disk. As for the format it's widescreen only and not the best of image quality. I'm actually thinking of ordering another copy only this time being more careful to read how this movie is formatted and that it's on one side of the disk only.,1
"Loved the book, but the ending was not what I had in mind!: Travel to Greece has never been at the top of my list, but I've changed my mind. The lyrical quality of De Bernieres' writing really formed a visual landscape in my mind. Now I need to see it for myself! I loved the book, right up until the last chapter. What a disappointment! I know things are always rosy, but still! Even so, I'll recommend it to friends.",1
Not Happy !!!: I bought this item as a combined package with the Sharp XE-A406 cash register. It is the WRONG SIZE PAPER!!! I even paid for expediated delivery because I needed it immediately. Now I have to wait for the correct paper. I am totally happy with the cash register but the paper that was supposed to work with it is useless to me.,0
"Piece of crap: Bought these for 94 year old Father so he could make notes to himself. One for home and one to carry in his pocket. Opened the package and put the batteries in and neither one of them worked. All you could get was static when trying to record. MADE IN CHINA, now there's a surprise. Returned them to Amazon with no problem, the only bright spot with this purchase.",0
"Wonderful Read: This book is outstanding! Napoleon Hill really brings a wonderfully positive message across. Completely inspirational! Open your mind and follow this book and you will become truly rich! I've been following most of Napoleon Hill's teachings and I must say that things are definitely going my way! You can become wealthy through his teachings, read a little deeper and change your attitude...things will go your way!",1
"Go Fish Superstar: Go Fish is a fantastic group that kids and parents both will really appreciate. Their songs are so fun and upbeat, their harmony is great, and even the old stand-bys are fun to listen to. We use these in our preschool class and the teachers like the songs as much as the kids!",1
"Wonderful book: I could not put this book down. The story is compelling, the writing is vivid. Sharfeddin immediately pulls you into the characters' lives. As much as I enjoy suspense, I rarely read westerns. I'm glad I made an exception here. Sharfeddin's story is a universal one of family and redemption. You'll learn a lot, think a lot, and be thoroughly entertained. I read 'Sweetwater Burning' in hardcover, when was called 'Blackbelly' - it's the same, wonderful book. Highly recommended.",1
Pros and Cons: Pros: Nice size and when it plays it plays wellCons: Battery doesn't last too long and some websites audios do not play properly. I try to listen to CBS Sportsline Fantasy review and the audio does't work properly through these speakers. It's very low and cracky.,0
"One of the most intriguing and real books about Vietnam.: I thought that this book was outstanding. It really gave me a feel of what it was like to live the life of a Marine sniper during that turbulent time. The action and suspense will keep you turning the pages. I read the whole book in two days. I couldn't put it down. Mr. Kugler gives the reader a good insight into what it was really like to be over there. Some of the grim realities of war are portrayed better most I have read. I was really moved with how he expressed the bond of brotherhood between himself and his fellow Marines. Anyone who is interested in this type of book must read ""Dead Center""!",1
whoa: I was highly mortified by the extremely horrifying display on my television set. If only i could go back in time and tell the 2 hour ago me not to watch this terrible excuse for a movie.,0
"The classic tale of the war that never happened.: I think this was the novel that made Clancy famous, and if correct then rightfully so. Red Storm Rising is the story of a conflict between the Soviet Union and NATO over oil, after terrorists strike at Russian Oil production. NATO is seen as the major obstacle to the conquest of the middle eastern oil fields, so it must be taken out first. The main action of the book revolves around the taking of Iceland by Soviet paratroopers brought in by ferry, and they efforts of the United states to take the island back. There is plenty of action described in Central Europe and other areas as well, as the friction of war and unexpected resistance slow the Soviet advance. This book is not as well written as Clancy's later books, but is still a good read and of interest to anyone who asks the question, what if America and the Soviet Union had actually clashed head to head in the late twentieth century.",1
"Paul Simon: Gershwin Prize: Happened upon this program on PBS and had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for two years. There's a reunion of Simon and Garfunkle, a performance by LadySmith Black Mombaza, and much more. We are so fortunate to have a song writer of this magnitude in our lifetime.",1
"Medicine for your hair: I use this two times a week and can't complain at how wonderful my hair is looking. I was having very dry course hair, and have tried lots of different shampoos from stores and salons. Well Not anymore. This one is a keeper. I have natural curly hair who needs lots of moisture. This does it for me. It does have a medicine smell to it, but I guess that's why is working finely.",1
"A truly exciting book: It was truly a very exciting book. It was exciting and interesting throughout the entire book. I just couldn't put it down. It never seemed to get boring at all. Even when it did it wasn't really boring, it just slowed down a bit to give more information on what was going on. It was always a needed part of the story so it wasn't really boring. It is a book that I would read again and enjoy many times.",1
"I'm Sure It's...: A great, spiritual story...but the atrocious acting renders this movie unwatchable.Don't believe me? Netflix it then reply.Movies that are spiritual in nature are not all good, some of them (such as this one) are very poorly made. Don't waste your money. Ansolutely horrendous!",0
"DAMNNNN GOOD: Remember its a movieeeee guysss.Well i wont tell anythign about the story like the other reviwers.JUST TAKE THE TIME AND WATCH THIS ONE, very good, good actors, and a good finale.if you like movies were you try to guess whats happening, and its not that, the you go ahhh now i know, and pum it wasnt it neither. WELL THIS ONE WILL STAND YOU GUESSING TILL THE END. ITS GOOODDD",1
"Save your money - use a washcloth or cloth diaper: These are absolutely adorable, but they don't stay in place between baby's wiggling legs. I use a washcloth or drape a cloth diaper over baby's legs - works much better and absorbs much more pee pee than the tee pee!",0
Good reading: I have found good information in these books. With deeper understanding of the importance of prayer in my day to day living.,1
Information worth knowing: The title of this book is misleading Mr Benson maybe should have named this Poaching to Feed Your Family instead of Survival Poaching. This is a good companion to Ragnar's Urban Survival book. There is not much information that would help you in a wilderness survival situation. If you want some wilderness survival information A good place to start is the U.S. Air Force Survival Handbook along with Wilderness Survival by Gregory J. Davenport. Professional training would be the best because these books will not teach you everything you need to know but will increase your chances by a very wide margin if you can learn what they teach. The info in this book is worth knowing just in case of hard times. All in all I enjoyed reading Mr Benson's book.,1
Worst Album of all time: They reckon Astounding Sounds is bad but this album would have to rate as one of the worst pieces of crap of all time. I mean the guys had a cheek even releasing it. Gimme In Search of Space or Hall of the Mountain Grill for classic Hawkwind.,0
OK: I HOPE PART 2 IS BETTER THEN THIS CRAP. TO MANY BAD WORDS COULD HAVE BEEN 3 STARS BUT NOT. I GIVE IT TO STARS. CAN:T WAIT FOE PART 2 LOL,0
"""Pan""tastic!!: Bought this pan for Thanksgiving and made the best turkey I have ever made! Turkey was moist and perfectly cooked. No parts were too dry, no parts were undercooked. Perfectly even cooking. I used the turkey drippings and made gravy on my stove top right in the pan. Delicious! Used the rack pan came with, and it was fine. My turkey was 24.6 lbs, so it weighed rack down a bit and bottom was not as crispy as top, but there was a lot of juice in the pan, and that may be the reason. Well worth the purchase. I will never use a disposable pan for a turkey again, even clean up was a breeze!",1
"I Take It Everywhere: Since receiving my Sangean220V radio, I hate going anywhere without it, even into the next room! I love knowing I can flip it on to keep me company whenever I get bored or things too quiet. I don't want to damage the earbuds, so I leave them retracted and use a separate headset when I'm not using the speaker. Reception is great on this little dude, and I got an AC Adapter at Radio Shack so the radio can keep me company by playing all night. I spent some time with the manual, and as a result am able to pretty much do the controls in the dark! It does have a display light, a clock and an alarm, but I don't really use those. I just love having a little radio I can tune easily using the digital tuning, and listen to without having to plug up my ears. It's small and easy to take along. I love it, and want a spare!",1
Nothing but lies: This book has nothing but lies in it. It is co-written by a bigot and the other person has close ties to the Bush family. The people who had anything to do with this book should be ashamed of themselves. Big money is behind this book and the same big money is behind Bush. I am a Military Spouse and in my opinion Kerry served his country enough said.,0
"Synopsis: ""Although he was born into slavery and endured a permanent physical disability, Epictetus (c. 50-c. 130 A.D.) maintained that all people are free to control their lives and to live in harmony with nature. We will always be happy, he argued, if we learn to desire that things should be exactly as they are. After attaining his freedom, Epictetus spent his entire career teaching philosophy and advising a daily regimen of self-examination. His pupil Arrianus later collected and published the master's lecture notes; the Enchiridion, or Manual, is a distillation of Epictetus' teachings and an instructional manual for a tranquil life. Full of practical advice, this work offers guidelines for those seeking contentment as well as for those who have already made some progress in that direction. Translated by George Long.""",1
laughable: it's a collection of plays from various folks. most of which no one has ever heard of and for very good reasons. i came across this because it was suggested by a friend I laughed at him and then laughed at this... thing.,0
"Great value: The Pyle PMDK-102 Pro Audio Speaker Stand and Cable Kit is a great value. Only one of my stands came with a lock-pin, but I've used them several times without incident. The cables are great, and the stands are sturdy enough to elevate my two PA speakers as well as survive set up, take down, and travel between multiple practice locations. Roadworthy? Of course not. But in my opinion, the speaker stands are certainly good enough for use in a typical practice environment. You won't find a better value on speaker stands and cables.",1
"Not My Favorite: It was alright, but I think the movie itself could've been better. It went way too fast in the events, I would've liked it better if had been more like the books, but even then, I've seen better fairy tales. All of you can like it if you want, I'm not stoping you, but I prefer other movies.",0
"Cynical exploitation: I think this is one of the worst films ever made. It is insincere and cynical, and really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. Made by a sensitive director, this could have been a wonderful film, but as it is ......... The song's good, shame about the cast.",0
So comfortable: This mat is so comfortable that you would like to work out even more. I use it not only for yoga but other floor execercies too. The smell goes away in 2 days.,1
"Stylish Horror: Often reviews describe the Bird with the Crystal Plumage as Dario Argento developing his style. In fact, it is a classic of the horror genre and an obvious influence on John Carpenter. Though somewhat closer to suspense than horror the cinematography of the scenes with the killer attacking with a knife are jolting and shocking and with the (for the times) explicit scenes restored you have a classic film right there. Later films by Argento would be mired down in style over substance. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, although obviously influenced by Hitchcock was taking Mario Bava to a new level and a blue print for the European horror film.",1
"There's something missing!: I'm afraid this collection lacks one of the best songs this group has ever made, ""Different Seasons"". It's a relief that ""Foolish Heart"" made it! I wished they didn't add those two remix versions ... it makes the collection cheap.",0
This pump has a design flaw: The small valve pops up so frequently that it is really not able to finish one session.,0
"A gift for a friend.: I did not read this as it was a gift for a friend who was recently put on Prednisone and was not sure how to deal with it. She said that it was very informative and helpful, but also somewhat alarming. A bit of a wakeup call for her about the drug.",1
I don't have my disc: HiI ordered this product in October 2012 as a gift for my dad. It has never arrived and this is just bad on Amazon. I thank Dee from Silberman the vendor that I purchased from because she has been helpful in getting me another disc. As for Amazon I'm so disappointed because there was no assistance from their side to track the package using their tracking mechanism. I would certainly not recommend my friends to use Amazon after this huge disappointment that I have experienced.ThanksKondi,0
"This was the worst pump I ever bought: I got home from the hospital and repeatedly tried to get my pump to work but no matter what I did, it would not work correctly. The pump action was so low, it would have taken me forever and a day to fill a bottle. Instead, I preferred to purchase the Medela Electric Doubleease pump. That has been the best pump for me and is well worth the money!",0
"An ""edge of your seat"" adventure: This is one of the better books of a good series, funny and exciting with an ""edge of your seat"" narrative. Lora Roberts does an excellent job portraying the edgier side of life in her Liz Sullivan series, where money isn't always available and sometimes the Thrift Shop is a necessity. Yet, she also manages to lighten this with some wonderful and sly humor and engaging friends. Liz's friends (including her dog) bring her much needed support and enrich the stories though they take a backseat in this book (except for a couple of memorable and surprisingly funny scenes at gunpoint). This particular book in the series was mesmerizing. I couldn't put it down till I found out what happened to Liz and her latest ""temp job from h-ll."" If you haven't read any of the previous books I would recommend you do so to see how Lora has allowed Liz to grow into herself. Yet, this books stands alone as a wonderful and exciting adventure.",1
"Disappointed Reader: I found ""Emma in Love"" to be extremely disappointing! Mr. Knightley is an old fogy, his brother is churlish, Jane Fairfax is even more of a non-entity than in Jane Austen's ""Emma"", Mr. Churchill is back to being a cad, and Emma herself is unconvincing and has lost her confidence. The story is choppy and disjointed and has overtones of homosexuality. Ms. Tennant does get an accurate conversational style and has the ability, I think, to write some really good ""imitation-Austen"". But the overall idea and the plot left a lot to be desired!",0
"Sublime: The soul caressing insights of Joe Hutto's experiences with the wild turkey were very inspiring, humbling and enriching experience, it's the sort of book you want to read again. Truly amazing. Thank you",1
"Harry Potter - read by Jim Dale: Oh dear...After the first HP book was read by Stephen Fry, and then broadcast at Christmas time on BBC Radio - in one wonderful, marathon offering (pre-recorded, obviously) - I was probably spoiled. He has the contract for the UK releases of the series, it seems.I have listened to Jim Dale's reading (he was the worst 'actor' in the Carry On films of the 60's and 70's) and can't disassociate him from the abysmal performances he gave in already badly acted films. His reading isn't much better and please forget that he has a British accent (the only valid reason for getting the gig) - It is forced, and he over-compensates for the lack of clarity in his 'luvvy', sometimes pompous, ""I am an actor"" drone.His HP version isn't a patch on Stephen Fry's. If you get the chance to buy the UK releases of the audio books, do so and avoid Mr Dale's weak and wimpy recordings.Such a shame that he landed the US contract, when we could have all enjoyed Stephen Fry's eloquence.",0
Best I've Ever Had: I've never had an easier to use mouse or trackball. The buttons are reprogrammable and easy to use. I especially like the ability to click a button and have a large section of the screen magnify. I highly recommend it.,1
a must have: It is a must have reference if one wants to get a good grade on papers. Is it easy to read?- No. But I find nothing easy about school. It is a comprehensive manual.,1
AhhhhhhhhhhhhhMMMMMMMMMMMooooooohhhh: MELT my foolish heart! Luxurious. Delectable. Delightful. Robust. Like creme broulet. Gentle and strong. Deep. A perfect appetizer for romance.,1
"Very loud, very disappointing....: We purchased this vacuum on the recommendation of Consumer Reports (it's at the top of their lists) and here at Amazon (where it's generally rated quite highly). After several months of use on our carpet, we have been very disappointed with the results. The vacuum simply doesn't pick up dirt reliably on our carpet. Nor does it actually pick up the detritus from the carpet -- the fuzzy stuff seems to gather up and get stuck in the mechanism, even at the highest and lowest settings. I actually find that I spend more time kneeling on the carpet cleaning up after the vacuum than I do actually vacuuming. Needless to say, a great disappointment. It also happens to be quite loud -- but if the product worked well, we would certainly be able to overlook that.",0
"I have done this already but here I go again: The experience with this transaction was TERRIBLE!!!! The product did arrive on time BUT its virus infected!!! Goes straight to quaritine. The virus is in the exe. file so the game wont play at all. Neither 'Galactics' or ""Amozon"" will replace it with a virus free copy- both say its the others resposibility.Amazon has asked me twice now fro my review and I've given them two reviews!I will say that I have had ""good"" purchases through Amazon but this was not one of them.AMAZON IF YOU REALLY ARE INTO CUSTOMER SERVICE????? Just replace my infected game with one that isnt and STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH COMPANIES THAT SEND OUT DELIBRATLY INFECTED PRODUCT!!!! AND quit asking me to review this transaction because your NOT going to get a favorable one. THIS TRASACTION SUCKED!!!!!! ~ Lee",0
Somewhat informative yet horribly repetitive.: The author is very indecisive in indicating which diseases killed which people. He uses too many sources to make the reading interesting or useful. The cause of many incidents are hard to cite as one disease or another due to lack of order and affirmation of facts. Not very believable.,0
"JUNK: Although I read other reviews, this corner bath caddy was WORSE than expected.Tough to assemble, wobbly, and very cheap looking. Not worth the cost of returning, it has been relegated to the cellar to store miscellaneous junk....",0
"Good: This game is one of the best games for xbox and certainly the best of first generation of xbox games.It has a rich story and waiting for a sequal.playing is fun, the controls are easy so easy in fact my 5 yr old can play it on his own.For the more expirienced player you can play on a harder difficulty level.This game is simply a must have for any collection",1
"Nice examples: If you learn about design from reading, this book isn't for you. It teaches by giving visual examples. The text does nothing more than analyze the design. It has the same feel as an award book. The work is outstanding and worldwide, but mostly from the UK. The writing is decent but mostly lacks depth. The examples, devine.",1
"An artist with a social conscience: The woman is sexy, smart and ethical. Did I mention she is also extraordinarily talented ? This is another album that gets the tears flowing. Some of the songs are heartbreakingly sweet and sad. Some are just sad, and honest. Some are just adorable. She runs the spectrum here. And again, I am a better human being for having experienced it. She has a little girl voice somehow, but she grabs your heart and squeezes. Be careful.",1
"Seems like it will be helpful.: I bought this as an engagement present for my best friends and gave it to them the day after they got engaged. It has a great deal of content and even if they don't end up using the worksheets, it's still fun for them to look at. The book itself was a little beat up (some of the divider tabs were creased, some dents on the cover) so it might be better to buy it at a store where you can see the actual book and content first.",1
Great Read: Jeffrey Deaver brings back my two fav characters in Sachs and Rhyme (what's up with Donahe in the move?) The Empty Chair takes you on a rollicking ride AGAIN and serves to surprise in the end. I'd recommend all the Deaver books as I haven't been disappointed yet.,1
"Wonderful: I searched high and low for a childs sewing machine that would imitate mine. With no photo available I was very skeptical about the price, so low. Well after searching and not finding what I wanted I went ahead and ordered. I'm so happy I did, my daughter loves it (7) and her sister wants to use it to. It's durable and lots of fun. Very safe. GREAT.",1
"Very disappointing for one of my favorite authors.: I have read everything Patricia Cornwell has written. This starts out very intriguing and leads up to a wonderful climax and then falls ""flat"". More of a wham-bam-no-thank-you ending. In comparison with her previous writings, this books falls very shot of her wonderful skill. It does not show here. Kay Scarpetta is mean and cold. Lucy has turned into some hard-core maniac and the reasoning is NOT believeable. It is time to let go of personal anger and bring back the characters that she is capable of writing about. Very disappointed, but will keep trying her again.",0
The Haunting of Whaley House: This movie is worse than bad. The acting is horrible. The script is ghastly. The special effects are circa 1960. Renting this movie was a total waste of money and time. I rated it one star because you must make a selection. It really deserves no-stars.,0
"Just read 7 habits: This book is repetitive and monotonous... Just read seven habits.. it seems like a knock of it.It is more of a self help book than a traders book, and even though it focuses on investors.. making the name misleading in my opinion. Van does not trade... Enough said?",0
"The Myth is that this Book is Worth Reading: I managed to wade through this sophomoric presentation but it was painfully difficult. The author taxes the reader over and over, using flashbacks again and again to tell a convoluted story of so-called friendship between two young women. The author also unsuccessfully attempts to make the story into one of suspense but really there is NO mystery. With a friend like Sonia, who need enemies? And Cameron? A spineless individual if ever there was one. (And why, one wonders, was the professor given such an important-and belabored-role in this comedy of errors anyway? He had no logical place at all in the story of the women's friendship.)If you are looking for a really good story, try one of Jodi Picoult's or Anita Shreve's books. You will not be disappointed as their stories really do contain suspense as well as friendship and genuine grief for losses current and past.",0
"Great Buy, Seller is Great: Couldn't be happier, product came in time expected in great shape and haven't had one problem with anything. Very Happy....",1
"underwhelming: I bought this CD with high hopes. However, after several listens (I tried to give it a chance), those hopes were dashed. The lyrics were killing me. I do not neccesarily prefer poetic or abstracted lyrics, but it kills me when a band appears to take itself so seriously but cannot verbalize its ""philosophical insights"" in any meaningful way. The lyrics are, at best, amateurish and juvenile, reinforcing my conviction that the only reason some bands get popular is because of this lack of depth (aka accesibility). And ""Good News..."" is definitely accesible- even to the 13 year old girls I saw buying the album at Walmart.",0
Pihkal: Very pleased with purchase. Arrived as expected and in mint condition wrapped in shrink wrap. Excellent read for anyone interested in this type of scientific research.,1
"Really good: I read this in one day! Really enjoyed the premise. A very different take on the Atlantis myth. As usual, the editing on the Kindle version is not so well done, but doesn't really take away from the story. I was going to buy the next in the series right away, but the comments about the editing and the publisher's review are staying my hand, at least for now . This one I would highly recommend.",1
Jawbone Bluetooth Headset: Very happy with the Jawbone. The noise assassin works perfectly. Great for someone who works around loud backround noise. Comfortable on ear. Highly recommend.,1
Not work for small bathroom: I bought this dehumidifier because the are some good reviews for it on using with small bathroom. I tried it once and it collected nothing. The mirror is covered with full of water steam. My bathroom is very small.,0
"Great Value: I bought this stand on a $20 impulse. It is great value. In hindsight, for my personal needs, I should have bought a stand that raises the laptop up off the desk a bit and have room to put stuff (keyboard, papers, whatever) underneath. If you that is not an issue and you want good value, I would recommend this item.",1
"Glow in the dark necklace 22"": I purchased this item to sell as a fundraiser at an all night walk at Relay for Life for the American Cancer Society. I thought it would be a great seller, since we had over 700 participants and would be walking in the dark. I was EXTREMELY disappointed when none of the 150 necklaces would glow properly. Some didn't glow at all, and others only glowed about 2/3 of their length. Many of the connectors were split and wouldn't hold the round shape necessary to wear as a necklace. I ended up giving replacement items to those who took the time to return the defective necklace that they had bought, and the rest I refused to take money for and threw them all in the garbage. $65 wasted, and no funds raised for my charity.",0
Luxury and Pop Dreams: What can be said? Instrumental Dreaming ... every trackputs you in a 60s-70s movie trailer..a great way tostart any day...A must cd...,1
"Good content, price increase unreasonable: The WSJ version for the Kindle is quite competent and an easy read. The indexing could be a better, but I read the whole first section anyhow. But the price increase to $180/yr makes no sense. I can buy the paper for $120/yr or I can buy the online version for $100/yr and sync it to the Kindle for free. Seems like the Kindle users are paying for the delivery users when it should be the other way around. As a protest, I had to cancel my Kindle subscription. Maybe I'll try the FT.",0
Worthless. Go to a Lactation Consultant if you need help: Money is better spent on a lactation consultant than a book!,0
"ashes, ashes all fall down: This is a classic of apocalyptic fiction. I have a 3 1/2 year old son. I cried after I read this book. Few books have ever affected me like that. It is hard not to get emotional even thinking about it. I read it about 2 weeks ago. I cannot fathom living through a ""nuclear winter."" I would do what I have to in order to protect my family. This is dark fiction and some people think its very unusual for Oprah to acknowledge it. I am a fan of apocalyptic fiction and, unfortunately I do not have a very optimistic view of the ability of this society to continue to sustain itself. Everyone should read this.",1
Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt: The Complete Series: This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I really hope their is a season 2.,1
"Kind of the wrong book.: As far as I can tell, the material of the book is the same as the one shown in the picture, but the book I was shipped is a special version only to be sold in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. It's a different number of pages and looks different, but I suppose it still has the same material.",0
"a very good text book: This book gives abundant examples and statements that help to deepen your understanding. It does not require much statistic background to follow the book, although sometimes the reasoning is not that obvious to me. But maybe because I am not a math student. I also feel that topics are a bit scattered in the book.",1
"Baby Signs: The BABYS SIGNS book contains great signing info, but It advocates ""making up"" signs . . . inventing your own language . . . limiting a child's ability to ""communicate"" with anyone outside of the immediate family. It's easy to simplify ASL signs that a child may have difficulty with. Why would anyone suggest ""making up signs"" when teaching ASL will provide your child a language they can use as babies . . . a basic language they can continue to learn in elementary, high school and beyond. American Sign Language is even being offered in high school and universites to fulfill the ""foreign language"" requirement. I hope parents will consider this before teaching their baby a non-universal language.",0
"Good, but should have been better: While I was happy that this soundtrack was finally released, I was disappointed with the omission of the mall theme song.The tracks are good, but repetitive. Considering how long we had to wait, this should have been better. How about releasing the soundtrack to Wolfen??",0
"Well Written and a Good Story.: This was my first read by this author and I was impressed. It was well written with a good story line. I'll be looking for more of her books in the future. In fact, I'm anxious to get the next book, In A Cowboys Embrace, the story about Cliff. Can't wait to see his reaction to Ella and Bryant, along with hearing more about what's going on in their lives.",1
"Ridiculous: I was so excited to delve into a scary summer read. What a mistake I made in choosing this book. The characters are totally unbelievable - especially the teenage boys. I should have stopped reading when it was remarked that one of the teenage boys used his ""handkerchief"" to clean up his dog's mess. A handkerchief? I quickly doublechecked the time and setting of the book. I thought maybe it was Victorian England. In my opinion the book went downhill from there. I ended up skimming the last 100 pages just to be finished with it. The only fright I got from this book was that I actually paid for it.",0
"Well written: As an admirer of SDO for quite some time, this book opened me up to admire her even more. This book told me so many things that I never knew. It also explained her reasoning behind many of her decisions, both as a justice and in life. Worth the read.",1
"Now comes with stainless steel knob, oven safe to 500F.: I haven't actually used this new Dutch oven, but I had the same one in brown and loved it (lost it in a move).

No need any longer to buy a replacement Le Creuset knob!",1

The story is almost perfect, but what is missing is Danny Elfman music and I missed the tone of Batman Return which is one of the top 2 batman movie ever filmed. Yes, I mean Batman Return and Batman Begins... they're both amaziong and well-made movie. I can't wait to get the rest of the other batman movies on HD-DVD!",1

"Dog book with a shar pei title: I really agree with one of the previous reviews. This book has very little information that is specific to the shar pei breed. It contains info about the history of the shar pei and the characteristics of the breed, but that is all stuff that you can find for free just from shar pei sites. The other information is general to practically all dogs, such as housebreaking, dental care, and finding a lost dog. I would not reccommend this book if you are really looking for information specific to the shar pei.",0

"Great text for introducing DSP: This text is very reader friendly. I have used this book in college and enjoyed it because of the fact that it is very clear and provides many illustrative examples to clarify certain concepts. I do agree with one reviewer in that its too bad it does not have solutions to the end of chapter problems, and for that I give it 4 stars instead of 5.If you want to get a clear concept and understanding of DSP without the complicated and exhaustive mathematics from other books, then purchase this one and keep it in your personal library.",1
"Millers Awash: I had read so much about Millers Crossing and had never seen it. So sat down and watched in anticipation. What a bunch of garbage. I read all these 5 star reviews and really can not see what these people saw. Acting average at best, script pathetically inept and well it basically goes absolutely nowhere. I was left thinking that it is two hours of my life that I will never get back.It is a film I will never watch again. One reviewer said every time he watches it (brave multiple viewer), he cannot find a flaw in the film...Wow really? Horrible.",0
"Could not finish it: Back in 2008, I read ""Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?"" on the 'American Thinker' website.So last summer when I was given a copy of 'Dreams From My Father', I was looking forward to reading it.But, the book was so uninteresting, after a few chapters, I returned it to it's owner.(And it turns out, she had not read it either).My guess is, a lot of liberals have this book laying on their coffee table, unread.If anyone does plan on buying this book, you might want to avoid reading""Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?"" By Jack Cashill. It might spoil it for you.",0
"Terrible, terrible, terrible: This book must have been written by a paranoid schizophrenic. It is full of crazy theories and ideas. Don't bother unless you like delusional fantasies. I felt like I was reading Mein Kampf.",0
"A show about weed that's not funny, how?: It's interesting that a show about weed is not funny. I'm not sure how they managed to do that but they achieved it. Half of each show is not even about weed, drug dealing or drug dealers. Half is about the next door neighbors cancer chick and her fat daughter. I despise Mary Parker. Her face looks like Michael jacksons and she is always wide eyed bug eyed staring around when she talks. Retarded. The guys that are on the show are effimanates and the women are supposed to be all empowered. Stupid show about weed that is not funny. Zooey is hot, so is shane's pre-teen girlfriend.",0
"Low Quality - TERRIBLE service: After two months of good service the pressure for espresso and temperature of the drip coffee both dropped significantly. I called the New Jersey service department and was dismissed offhand, told only that I should clean the espresso screens. When I pressed the issue of cold coffee I was told that was not a problem. For me it is.The service is poor enough that I would recommend not buying any Briel products.",0
Lou Reed: I owned this cassette back in the early 80s! Loved it! I played it until it fell apart. I'm just now getting around to replacing it with a CD. I do recommend this collection of Lou Reed's best.,1
It didn't work: I was so excited to get this in the mail and get started walking. Unfortunately it didn't work correctly. I followed the directions and still it wasn't counting steps correctly. This definitely put a damper in my eagerness to get healthy. I returned it for a refund.,0

"it'll do until Episode 1: It's okay. Not the best book I've ever read, but probably the best Star Wars book there is, which, unfortunately, isn't really saying all that much.If there was one thing that really drove me insane about the book, though, it was the sloppy editing and reuse of phrases. If I ever hear the words ""in a heartbeat"" or any variation thereof again, someone's getting hurt.",1
"A movie that will DEFINITELY stand the test of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Just like a bunch of other wonderful films that stupid critics justliterally bashed and trashed to bits(perfect examples: ""SOMEWHERE IN TIME"",""THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS"",""ANNA AND THE KING"",etc.)""AUSTRALIA""didn't fair too well at the box office nor at the academy awards.That is thePERFECT REASON why I never listen to movie critics!Instead,I go and bethe critic myself!As many of the other reviewers have stated,this filmfeatures some of the most breathtaking and gorgeous cinematography toever do the actual country of Australia justice!Not only that,it alsorecaptures the feel of Hollywood's classic 'Golden Era' of films andfilmmaking at its finest!NICOLE KIDMAN and HUGH JACKMAN deserved academyawards for their OUTSTANDING portrayals of their characters!Hollywoodshould make more movies like this one and THEN SOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Good source of J2EE Patterns - With little new additions: With great curiosity, I bought this second edition once again the J2EE pattern gurus made a great attempt to bring this book well updated.This book anchors solid patterns foundation for J2EE components revising some of the existing patterns and also fixed some of the gaps found in the previous edition. The J2EE component design strategies, refactorings and bad practices makes a big impact for any developer and makes this book again a worth buy.One disappointing factor, Except for couple of new Web services patterns the book is not mature enough on defining patterns for J2EE Web services scenarios, which is the focus of upcoming J2EE 1.4 specifications.",1
"Kindle II: The Kindle II has many improvements over the Kindle I. Though the page-turn buttons are less likely to be hit by accident, they are harder to push. Also, the added length is inconvenient for travel. Shorter would have been better than longer compared to Kindle I.",1
"My First Time But I'd Do It Again: I found the novel a bit dis-jointed at the beginning. Perhaps it was just me. I had trouble figuring out how the characters were related to one another. But as the novel progressed, those relationships became clearer.I found the novel to be fairly fast-paced and not prone to getting bogged down in unessential details. A few unexpected twist and the surprise ending clerarly tells me that I would do it again (read) with this author.",1
"Well-written, but I see what many are saying . . .: First off, this novel never gets boring, which is quite an achievement for something so long. Chabon does an impressive job of telling the tale of two cousins with different backgrounds. Yet while the story and delivery are first-rate, there isn't exactly a literary message per se beyond keys, locks and imprisonment, be this last of the physical, social, mental or emotional sort. Sure, you could go back and write a book report about that sort of symbolism, but you don't really come away from the novel the same way you might with ""Catcher in the Rye,"" ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,"" ""Elmer Gantry"" or ""The Great Gatsby,"" but then those have weathered the test of time and ""Kavalier and Clay"" might suffer from being a work of contemporary fiction in that regard. What author who writes today really attains that kind of status in the here and now? Irving, Updike and Cormac McCarthy . . . maybe.",1
"Works great in my Dell Dimension 8200: I was a little worried about putting this card in my PC as a couple other reviewers had problems with card recognition in a Dimension. However, this card worked great for me on the first try, I am very happy with it. However, the fact that it is called 5-port is a little deceiving, it actually has 4 external ports, and one internal port which is completely useless for me. Other than that I would have given 5 stars.",1
"Not helpful: Found these CDs and booklet to be useless. It consists of awkward conversations that are made of endless broken phrases. As far as I'm concerned, a poor product.",0
"Please Make It Stop!!: When he's telling a story and not singing, Bill is not bad. But when he sings... let's just say Bill's voice resembles fingernails on a chalkboard. It was agonizing listening to the whole CD. Granted there are a ""few"" songs that were bearable, but over all not what I was expecting after all the rave reviews. The overpriced CD has the look and sound of a low budget production. I would not recommend purchasing this to anyone.",0
doesn't work: One of the shufflers works but the other does not-it bunches up the cards and then it won't shuffle.The second seems to work fine and they really are great for games requiring 6 decks of cards,0
"Nothing happens...: What if you assembled a band and started to record them, but nothing happened. They played and played, but nothing musical happened. It just went on and on and on. And still, nothing happened. There is no musical development, no divergence from a deadly boring formula here. I don't get it. If this represents Yo La Tengo's musical abilities and creativity, I don't understand their stature in the music world. I haven't been so bored listening to something since hearing my parent's Perry Como records. Very frustrating and completely without merit.",0
"old and new material [especially on qubits]: This book has two types of material; both well done. The first could have been written decades ago, and is the ""traditional"" atomic physics. Where you start with the hydrogen atom, and investigate its spectroscopy with the Schrodinger equation. Then the book takes the next logical step by going to helium and thence to heavier atoms. LS and JJ coupling and other refinements. Such material is now quite well known and you need this for a solid background.But the book also has much more recent material. On quantum computing using qubits. These attempt to use the quantum states of small groups of atoms, to perform computations fundamentally different from current digital efforts. Enough detail is given for you to appreciate the severe experimental travails of the field, and how much more remains to be done, if qubits are ever to become useful.",1
"I want 90 minutes of my life back: Let me say first off that I love Joss Whedon- and I mean anything and everything he does. He is a modern day TV and movie genius. But he missed the mark with this one. No wonder it sat on the shelf for so many years. It was terrible, boring, and just plain stupid. I have no idea how anyone could give this a good review. It was an insult to one's intellegence. It was not funny, scary, or clever. Just dismal.",0
Beautiful Movie: Bambi is an adorable movie that I have watched over and over as a child. Now that I have 2 little girls of my own I have purchased the movie for them to enjoy.,1
Strong on opinion; weak on historicity: Whether you will like Mr. Foster's work or not depends on the style of historical writing you enjoy. If you like writing in the style of Stephen Sears you will enjoy this book. If you like writing in the style of Joseph Marsh you probably will not. It all hinges on how much opinion you are willing to tolerate in and the degree of historicity you demand out of works of history.,0
"Bone M does Mary's Boy Child: I bought this primarily for the song, ""Mary's Boy Child"". I had heard their version as a teenager and fell in love with it. I was teaching at a Christian school and knew my class would love it and I was right. It is still one of my favorite Christmas tunes.",1
"Not what it claims to be....: I had tried to watch a demo of this video, but unfortunately, the only clip you can watch does not show what the ride looks like. After buying it, it turns out to be a lone rider climbing a hill at a VERY slow pace. Not too inspiring. And also unfortunately, NO RETURNS. Buyer Be Ware. Last video Ill buy with out a thorough review first.",0
"First half, interesting - second half, offensively ridiculous: Sykes is a great writer, and he makes the history of science much more fascinating than it probably actually was. But still, a great way to discover how we came to know the things we know.Then the story tries to explain what is happening (and what will happen). Prepare for your intelligence to be insulted. After explaining that sex exists because genes are trying to preserve themselves, he overlooks the little fact that you only have 1/32 of your great-great-grandparent's genes, so the ""selfish"" genes aren't doing a very good job of sticking around. His book is rife with contradictions - see if you can discover the ones involving dandelions, gay genes, and more.Genes don't plan ahead; Sykes comes across as some kind of animist that sees spirits in genes instead of trees. I talked to two other colleagues, all of us scientists, who had the exact same experience. Enjoyed the first half, never finished the rest.",0
"Uninspiring, banal breathnach.: Sarah Ban Breathnach steals. Doesn't anyone remember that it was Emerson, and the Transcendentalist crowd who first coined and developed the term, ""Divine Discontent?"" Throughout her book, she seems to offer ideas or terms of expressions as if they spun organically and originially from her own mind. Ms. Breathnach offers many New-Agey type ideas that are either silly, or else you're sure to have read them years ago in women's magazines. She really needs to sit down, reflect, and truly come from an authentic place from within her own soul. What she says and how she says it doesn't ring true.",0
"Good thought for the game, but the product not the greatest: After reading several reviews on Amazon.com and couple of other web sites, and then finally maing the purchase, and actually playing the game, I'm somewhat disappointed in its design, gameplay and the story. I've expacted a little more. Truely graphics need to be improved, they don't look like PS1, but need major improvement. Gameplay is simply okay, but the story and the plot of the game could be done with more sense. I personally hate the idea of chasing some guy around NYC for couple of longer minutes, before he finally stops and tells you, that you can race him. The game itself is somewhat confusing as it lacks good instructions and what the objectives are.If I were to rate this game by gameplay, design, etc. here is what you can expect (on a sacle from 1 - 10):Gameplay - 6Graphics - 7Sound - 7Fun to play - 5Value - 8 ...",0
"Great meditation music: Beautiful music for meditation, relaxing and very enjoyable. You can almost imagine yourself out among the stars!",1
"Such a Disappointment: OMG... what a mess. While I didn't expect it to be as wonderful as the original series I certainly didn't expect it to be as badly done as it was. Other than Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, the casting (in my opinion) was all wrong. This movie was sleazy and stupid. They made Jessica Simpson look and act like trash as Daisy Duke -- Catherine Bach never seemed so sleazy... she was innocent and cute/pretty. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville were totally bafoonish...just awful! The original Bo and Luke Duke (John Schneider and Tom Wopat) were smart, sweet and mischeivious in an innocent way. The only thing original about this movie was the General Lee...Sleazy and stupid. So not worth the price of admission or the price of a DVD. Watch this on cable and call it a day. You are missing nothing!",0
3 more credits!: History II was my second CLEP and I passed easily with a score of 70 largely due to this book. I had very little prior knowledge of the material and studied for about 3 weeks. I used this book and Petersons on-line tests to prepare. I feel that this book would have been enough on its own. CLEP tests are free for military and reserve members so you have very little to loose. Just go for it.,1
Great 80's music from a great movie: The music helped make the movie so having the CD is just awesome. Its an awesome addition to my music collection.,1

"A terrible book: Under no circumstances should you buy this book. It has major flaws:1) The material covered does not seem to match what is actually on the test.2) The mathematics is full of typographical errors; as a result many of the problems are incomprehensible.3) Some of the solutions are ridiculous, incoherent nonsense.A much better book is ""Cracking the GRE Math Test"" by Leduc",0
"Awesome Bsides- not just for fans!: The aside is nice, but the two bsides are two beautiful numbers. Just Getter Older is a reflective number and Idler's Dream is one of the groups most romantic and most lovely songs. Buy! Buy! Buy even if you are not a fan! This single is brilliant and so is ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"". Listen Up before you automatically rule it out!",1

PS, I love the movie: Everything came in time and was in perfect order, Of course I love the movie I had seen it at the movies and fell in love with it. It has so many references to art and since I got a degree in art/art history, I had a great time watching it.",1
Too much lost juice: The juicer does not extract enough juice from the pulp of the fruit before it ejects it. I put a hand full of grapes into the jucier and got 1/4 cup of juice. I squeezed the pulp it ejcted by using cheese cloth and got over a cup..More juice in the pulp than in the catch basin.I will look for another jucer as soon as I can.,0
"Desperately disappointing: War Game is a desperately disappointing animated adaptation of Michael Foreman's excellent children's picture book about the Christmas Truce of 1914. Unfortunately, in the hands of the Snowman team it's all just too nice and safe for the respite to have any power, and the loss of the haunting ending from the book (where the hero's body slowly vanishes under falling snow) in favour of something less upsetting to the kiddies renders it all even more so what: only the beautiful yet quietly devastating closing lines of narration truly work. Terrible performances from many of the voice cast, too. At least at 29 minutes it's brief.",0
One time use gloves?: Gloves ripped the very first time I used them to do a brake job. Not impressed with these gloves at all. I would have been better off using disposable gloves.,0
"Great Design But Horrible Functionality: I love the look and of it, thats why I bought it. But after owning this for only a month I was unhappy with my purchase.The keyboard went first. The lag time everyone talks about is very true. And not just at high typing speeds. It was at normal speeds where I couldn't even type anymore because it would take only half of the letters I pressed. I had to switch back to my old keyboard.I kept the mouse, but it didnt take long to develop problems just like the keyboard did. The accuracy of the mouse is awful and it also lags -- sometimes where it doesnt work at all.Don't be fooled by the look - you will surely be disappointed with the functionality after a few months.",0
"very satisfied: I was somewhat worried about what kind of suit I would get in a grab bag, but it was such a good deal... and I'm pretty adventurous... It's a beautiful racing suit.Tip* If you're tall, order a larger size than listed on the sizing chart. The first suit I ordered was too small/short.",1

"RYUICHI'S BEST...Maybe.: If you are a fan of Mr. Sakamoto, this is a must-have CD. He has such varied musical styles, but to me this CD is an example of his most contemporary and yet mainstream compositions. One of the things I love about the artist is that he always manages to include some of his brilliant Asian-flavored sounds as well...never forsaking his roots. I also recommend NEO GEO, which is this CD's forerunner. Heartbeat is a never-weary addition to your catalog. It is full of life, but with a few ""rainy day"" interludes.",1
"Great Value: I can't tell you how much these vacuum bags have helped out. My son was diagnosed with asthma and the first thing the doctor suggested was microfiltration bags and to vacuum when he was not in the same room...its made a huge difference to his quality of breathing. Secondly, the brand name bags are way too expensive for my budget. The Envirocare are probably the cheapest on the market and actually work",1
Excellent Product but not for Typical cocker: This works GREAT on my cat and on my lab and on my cocker who has a field coat! The amount of fur that comes out is incredible and my animals LOVE for me to use it! I have 4 dogs and the only one that it does not do well on is my long-haired cocker.It does a fantastic job with all the others. I highly recommend it!,1
"love the story: the story is very good. i saw the reviews and was impressed. i didnt like seeing old cast members, the article i read awhile back stated there would be new cast with some come backs, but i didnt think it would be this much. i like the season a lot though, really takes you out there.",1
Excellent Training Manual: This really is a training manual covering all the basics. From stance to punches and kicks this book has a good format. If you're new to JKD or come from a traditional martial art this is a good start (some friends who box liked the punching section). Overall a good book to help you develop a training routine. There is nothing on Iron Palm so disregard the other review.,1
"Too many ""shoulds"": I didn't really care for this book. It *does* have alot of filler, like the last reviewer said. And Falk is rather full of herself when it comes to writing. Obviously she is published, so her method of plotting and preparing worked for her. However, I think it will do a beginning author a disservice to think it is the *only* way.",0
BE CAREFUL!!!: This game is not a good game! It is very dangerous and can do bad things thjat can change your life! Do not buy it! Its not cool! Take my advice and stay away unless you want to risk something.,0
nice-looking nightstand: The nightstand has a modern and clean look. The color matches my bed frame very well. However it arrived upside down and rails for the drawers fell off. I had to reinstall them. Besides that it looks nice.,1
"What a great read: I found this book while wandering through one of the local book stores. The cover caught my eye & although this is a different genre for me, I bought it & it quickly became one of my favorite books. Jack, the lead character, certainly charges through life by the hour getting into one mess after another. Just like the supporting characters, you can do nothing but sit back and hold on for the ride.While you will laugh and shake your head at his ""messes"" you will also enjoy the introspective moments as well.It is well written, but doesn't get bogged down in too many details. I could easily picture each situation as they happened as well as feel each reaction of Jack and the other characters as they happened. I have recommended this book to several friends & hope to see more from this author. Great job!",1
samsung 225bw: DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR.I purchased one a few years ago. within a year it started flickering. i was able to send into Samsung to get repaired.About 2 years after that it started again (about 2 months ago) I called and Samsung said there is nothing they can do about it since its out of warentee.I do some searching on Samsung 225bw (DO THIS! you will see how bad this monitor is) and find this is a common problem. seems they put in some bad capacitors in it and they blow out.So now im stuck with a monitor that is 3 years old and useless. When i have a 15 inch that has lasted 7 years now.I will not be buying Samsung again. i suggest you pass this monitor and get a different brand.,0

"Good book, Gunther is very human.: Joe Gunther, the Brattleboro, VT detective becomes part of the state's Attorney General's camp while he investigates a statewide drug trafficking ring. The ring is operating below the radar of local law enforcement, but comes under scrutiny after ensnaring a small time cop in their dealings.Gunther gets wrapped up the case, as much because he is wondering how his long involvement in law enforcement is starting to effect his life. Is he cynical or numb to the sights he sees and the lives he intersects with?The case centers on the life of one man, his underage runners, a woman he abuses and children caught in the center of it all. We have become desensitized to all of this with a big city backdrop but seeing it played out against a small town is sobering. Mayor brings the human toll of it into focus.A little long, but Gunther's continuing story is worth the effort.",1

So when I bought his deck, I was assuming to see all the essentials we all know and love from the show. Bolshack Dragon, Armored Blaster Valdios, Gattling Skyterror, Scarlet Skyterror, y'know. I am very happy with this deck, however, my only disappointment is that none of the above cards were in it! It still rocks, and has all my favorite swarm creatures, and Metalwing Skyterror is awesome, too. So I still enjoy it. Buy this deck, it's worth it!",1

"This product needs some work...: I think that the idea of this product is great, but we have had more trouble with it than any other toy, ever. My three year old is a whiz at the computer and at playing nintendo games, but this game is just so slow, it stops often and it has to be re-programmed so often that it just frustrates her and me both. She is a pacient little girl, but has completely lost interest in this game and prefers to play on the computer and other toys that do not cause so much frusteration and consume so much time programming and re-programming. The ONLY game that worked out of four that I bought was the Spongebob one, and it really rarely works correctly anyway. Maybe this toy can be modified and will be a better product next Christmas.",0

"A great physicist and entrepreneur writes on his passion: Melvin Schwartz won the Nobel Prize of physics in 1988 by his experiments (with Leon Lederman and Jack Steinberger) on this most elusive of all physical objects, the neutrino. We must be grateful for the fact that he found time to write this precious little book on electrodynamics. It is a gem .

I'm not going to trash the rest of his work because I find some of it to be quite good, but I would love to know how on earth that poem got published. I find it pointless and quite frankly, boring.

"A book for everyone!: An outstanding set of books!!! This set of books is by far, the best set of natural healing books I've found. It was recommended to me by two traditional medical professionals and it has an amazing amount of current information. The first book provides detailed summaries of many natural herbs and supplements, healing therapies, tests you might not hear about from traditional medical doctors and many other ways to improve your health. The second book addresses specific health disorders and how to treat them. This has to be one of the best reference texts on this topic!!!",1
"Wonderful Treasure: This is a treasure chest full of early unreleased Jimi. These songs really show the heart and soul of Jimi Hendrix as a thoughtful songwriter. As always, the guitar is wonderful and amazing; but there's something peaceful in even the most scorching of solos on this disc.

"""Forgotten Treasure Found"": There is a silver lining in the fact that this fabulous live recording was set aside and forgotten for 22 years (which makes it a sort of time capsule.)By the time it was released as a CD in 1996, the technology had moved fast forward. And while the excitement of this live outdoor performance cannot be improved upon, refinements in sound quality and innovations in the graphics industry make the album and its cover design possibly as close as you can get to the electric energy of the event itself.If an extra-terrestrial were looking to get real hip in a hurry he would tune his nerdy antennae to this performance. ""The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me"", the medley of ""Try To Remember/The Way We Were"" and ""Neither One Of Us"" are tour de force renditions of these well known songs.This is, without a doubt, a must-have album for any lover of Gladys Knight and the Pips and their Motown sound.",1
"Broke in a few months: I'm still looking for a GOOD one-handed pepper mill. This one has a very low volume per grind, so I had to work hard with it. It also broke after less than six months, which means I'm looking again!",0
great price for a wonderful product: Amazon has the best price around for this product. It's Organic. It's whole wheat. It tastes great. I like the fuller taste (and healthier characteristics) of the whole wheat. Our daughter loves it and you don't have to feel guilty about giving it to her. Throw in veggies or tuna or eat it plain - it's a good meal.,1
"Could have told us more: It was an okay read, but most of the information here was on bad treatment of the animals. Not that this isn't important, but I wanted to know more about the things that we are eating. More about the use of sick and diseased animals. The animals are going to die and the plants aren't pretty (Just drive around Greely, CO) The smell would make most of us very ill, but that is what they do to get the food to us.I wanted to know about the hormones, chemicals, diseases. She should have covered more of that. Not really worth 20 bucks",0

"Disgusting - solid salt: I purchased a New Years living social deal which included 4 filets, 4 stuffed potatoes, and 1 1/2 lbs of this blackened shrimp. I cooked the shrimp as directed in a cast iron pan and served on quinoa. It smelled amazing. Then we tasted it- there was way too much salt and spice on the shrimp- to the point that it was completely inedible. And we are spice lovers in this house -we eat tons of spicy curry on a regular basis. We even tried rinsing the shrimp off but the salt was infused completely through the shrimp. What a disappointment and waste of money. The steaks weren't anything special either but the stuffed potatoes were good. I won't be ordering again.",0
"I can't stop talking about it.: This book is by far one of my favorites. People try to punch me all the time because I always talk about the ideas this book puts forward.It makes you think. With apsects such as collective unconscious, the entire paranormal spectrum, mythology, the reality of imagination, etc., this book has it all. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to challenge his normal views about the world around him. Patrick Harpur, with his Irish charm, did Joseph Campbell, Carl G. Jung, and Terence Mckenna proud.Plus! It comes in a beautiful, quality, hardback edition!",1
"OF DIANA: This book is as good as it was critically acclaimed to be and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It made me really see what had happened or what might have happened that fateful day. I goes over everything. If you are even the slightest bit curious, I recommend this book to you. It is fascinating.",1
"Good Book: I first saw this book in my sons Scholastic book order. I was familiar with Suzann Collins writing from the Hunger Games trilogy and I loved those, but I was hesitant because these were kids books. I read the reviews and saw that some other adults had read it, so I gave it a try. I was pleasantly surprised how they have kept my interests. I have read 3 of 5 of The Underland Chronicles so far and I can't wait to finish the series. Great books!!",1
What an amazing person!: I am the mother of a 2 year old with autism. This is the closest I can get right now to knowing even a little about what is going on in his head. I don't think any psych or pediatrician can even consider themselves an expert of the same caliber as Dr. Grandin. She is autism!,1
It's OK: This page up document holder works alright but is not nearly as good as the one I lost. Here are the problems as I see them. #1--product is too light-tends to slid off desk-#2-aperture for inserting documents are too large-documents blow right out with a little air such as from a fan. In order to compensate-I had to make a paper cushion and tape it down in the aperture-that works but is not really best. This page up holder needs to be larger around the base and heavier and the aperture needs to be reduced. It's pretty to look at-something my 4 year old granddaughter would like but in my opinion is not suitable for my requirements. I would not buy another just like it.,0
"Don't waste your money: It is amazing that such a poor product with potential health altering results can be allowed to be sold. My readings were about fifty point sys, and twenty points dias over. My girlfriends reading were the same. And this is in comparison to using a traditional cuff. Don't buy this, and lets all hope that dangerous products like this that people depend on get taken off the market.",0
"Different, but good entertainment.: This is an entertaining movie for SCI-FI buffs,but still has a silly and comical kick to it as well.",1
"Nothing Special....: I will admit, I really only got this because I liked how the author drew the charectors on the cover. I learned not to judge a book by its cover long ago w/ Daupne Du Mauriers Rebecca, w/ its sleazy looking cover. The main difference is that that turned out to be great, when I thought it would be slutsy... (And also, I.N.V.U. is a graphic/anime novel...)But, this one was just plain stale. Honestly, I have heared this same souped up story numerous times in many other anime. A teenage girls life turns topsy-turvy, and she falls in love w/ two differnt people (w/one whos older than her). Wow. How totally unique. I've never seen or heared anything like it before. NOT. Also, it was just plain boring. I forced myself to get it over w/ but couldint even finsih the last five pages, or so. NOT RECCOMENDED. GET SOMETHING FUNNY AND DIFFERNT LIKE RANMA 1/2. SERIOUSLY!",0

"A great biography of a great novelist: Nolan sems to have captured quite a bit of the life of Kenneth Millar, an especially daunting challenge considering that the great mystery novelist prized his privacy.

"Good While it Lasted: This mirror was great while it lasted, which was only about 6 months, and then the lights burned out. I had a similar one prior to this that lasted 20 years! I would try another brand next time.",0
"ridiculous ""film"": I'll keep it short and simply say that anyone going into viewing this ""film"" with even an entry level knowledge of biology or history (or both) will be immediately insulted and ashamed and embarrassed for having watched it. Equating Hitler with Darwinism is revisionist history, and trying to blame Darwin for Hitler's depraved acts is a mendacious. This film is purely propaganda. Even Fox news rated it poorly (that says something in itself.) It's funny that PZ Myers was ""expelled"" from the theater showing after being invited to see it! Do a quick google search for ""expelled exposed"" to read the total deconstruction of the film by people who know what they're talking about.",0
"I just don't get it...: I just don't understand how this book got all these 5 star reviews. I don't consider myself a beginner -- but I just could not read this book. It just jumps all over the place, using terms not in common practice, and not really building on anything.There were times I struggled to understand a concept only to realize that it was just something really simple. Other times, the topic ended just when it was getting interesting.",0
"Death to Everyone: Sparse Instrumentation and hauntng melodies make up this release from Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy and they won't leave your head for days. From the Bass and piano opening of Minor Place to the end its simply put a brilliant record. Full of gorgeous melodies and simply beautiful string arrangments. The album does truly sound aged in a way that will let it always be a timeless record that will live on for years to come as an intelligent and inspiring piece of work. The tender intelligence that the lyrics portay is none the less amazing. I dont have to sit here and type why its good...just buy it and find out for yourself.",1
"Don't waste your time!: I know we all have different tastes and opinions.......but this movie just did not hold my attention at all. Shallow, poor story line, characters not very believable. I wasn't impressed with any part of this movie.",0
"NOT Worth the money: MAP 330 is NOT for street navigation as it does not give turn-by-turn driving directions, as advertised. It draws a straight line from start point to destination point and YOU have to figure out which streets to follow to reach your destination. The software has outdated database and failed to locate my house and some other locations which were successfully located by other softwares. Even software does not give turn-by-turn driving directions, but draws a straight line from start to destination. That leaves you fully dependent on printed maps to work out your route. I found free services (...) better than this expensive product.",0

"Shes's got rhe look very good series: I watched this up till I had to pay for it and it was great.. I willwatch the rest next month when I get my check. It's a shame you haveto pay extra for it on prime, but the company that releases it are theone's still trying to make a few extra bucks off the series but thisone is worth it , a must see of older women who look really beautifulfor their age .. you go girls!!!!!",1
"What a disappointment: The t-harness I purchased with the remote starter did not fit my 2002 Silverado like it said it would. When I finally got everything wired together it worked fine and then after the second or third time using the remote start my ""check engine soon"" light came on. I found out that the spade connectors did not fit tight enough on the terminals causing the check engine light to come on. I tore the unit back out and got the connectors tight enough to keep the voltage from dropping out on the ignition wires. Now I am finding that my security light comes on when I use the remote start in very cold temperatures. Apparently this is common in lower end bypass modules as the resistance shifts as temperature drops. Bottom line, don't buy Bulldog products!!",0
"Entirely Memorable!: Paul Simon's songs are all special and memorable and are beautifully performed in this video. I saw this performance first on TV and was so happy when it finally was offered on DVD! Mark Anthony just about brings down the house with his performance; Simon and Garfunkel singing the classic ""Bridge over troubled waters"" brings back so many memories. The African singers, Lyle Lovett, etc. all were exceptional. This is a must get AND must play often!!",1
Great Deal: It came promplty and no bends on the corners. Would buy again. 12 dollars cheaper then the school book store!,1
"Not built for long term use: If you buy this keep it safe from the elements. The cheap plastic ""chain"" that operates the cranks failed on mine along with the plastic lock for the legs.

Great Building Information: This is one of the best books I have seen for information of how to build for any DIYer. The pictures are clear and very well labeled. I wish I had bought this book before I started building my house and barns. I would have done a lot of things differently. Buy informational books before you build anything! Learn from other people's mistakes.,1

"A British View: I'm not sure I can share Bill Emmott's skepticism about China. From the United States' point of view, the US-China relationship is going to be the most important bilateral relationship in the 21st century. Already in 2003 China has become America's third largest trade partner (after Canada and Mexico, and ahead of Japan) and America is China's second largest trade partner (after Japan and ahead of the EU). If the economic boom in China continues - a big if, but nonetheless a realistic one - then China will replace the United States as the largest economy within two decades. No wonder observers from Margaret Thatcher to Jack Welch to Henry Kissinger to Paul Wolfowitz are predicting China's rise to superpower status. Bill Emmott's opinions are unlikely to be widely shared here in the United States.",0

"Just stick to comedy gags Al.: In my honest opinion, Al Franken reached his intellectual zenith as the stoned, bumbling baggage handler in Trading Places. It's been a steep descent since, and this latest book of his only makes this fact more obvious and sad. A few paragraphs were mildly humorous, but nothing that'll cause spontaneous coffee discharge from your favorite orifice. If you want humor, pass this one over and read Dave Barry. If you want incessant, hate-charged ranting from a kooky leftist who still believes the 21st century began on 1/1/2000, then this is your book.He's NOT good enough...he's NOT smart enough, and DOGGONIT, people are starting to DISLIKE him.",0
"He's Lost His Title Belt: I am a huge fan of Jone's supreme first collection of stories, Pugilist At Rest. But with the competent Cold Snap and the completely lackluster, Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine, Jones seems to following the path of many great heavyweight fighters. Once the win the belt the get fat and lazy, in Jone's case he rehashes many old themes with language that tries to have the old zip but falls embarasingly short. The title story, Tarantula, and Mouses come close to what his genius used to be but even they have this forced quality that makes me want to beat the crap out of his editor.Someone should have told the champ not to step into the ring with these stories. I have faith that he can make a comeback, but, unfortunatley, with this recent collection mediocrity has knocked him down for the ten count. And I want my $$ back!!!",0
"Great travel companion: This book is a great travel companion if you go to China and speak little mandarin. It saved me on numerous occasion (train station, shopping, restaurant); I like it so much that i bought the Italian and French one for other trips.I like the topics covered and having the characters, pinyin and english translation side by side is very convenient. I often pointed at a sign or a sentence to get some help. Tourist books vocabulary section are really useless for a weeklong trip.Quick note: the back cover states: USA 7.95$...a HAPPY TRAVELER",1
"Oh, I Get It - No, Don't Get It!: ""Mellon Collie""? Oh, I get it. Cute. Well, thefirst clue that this is a dud is that most decent double albums sell at more than this one, which reflects its relative worth.There is really nothing here, as the so-called ""hits"" are poor and the filler is exceptionally poor. I guess every band deserves to put out a mediocre, self-indulgent and erratic album at least once in their career. The Beatles did it with the While Album, Pink Floyd did it with the Wall, and now we have the Reeking Pumpkins offering with Mellon Collie. So bad it's not funny. 1-star.",0
"This is a Vampire movie?: Jon Bon Jovi. Ok that sums up reasons to watch this movie. Now onto every reason not to...it doesn't follow hardly anything I've ever known about Vampires, it lacks action in a major way, it is slow moving...or maybe it just seems that way because you have to force yourself to stay awake through it. If you are a die hard Jon Bon Jovi fan, like myself, buy it, he looks great. If you want a good vampire more go get ""Interview with the Vampire"", ""Queen of the Damned"", or ""Blade"" and ""Blade 2"", those are vampire movies worth watching.",0
"Nice Features if it Worked for more than a month: This metronome has all the right features but I have had THREE of them in 6 months. They work fine, then stop, change the batteries then it may or may not work again. I am done returning this model - time to find something reliable.",0
"Dull & Dumb, Bad Combination: The acting is stale, the plot is awful. The Man In Black was a piece of crap and the Michael and his mask is again not scary but more funny than anything. The killings in this one are laughable and the ending it makes you believe that Donald Pleasance's character dies. Sad going for him to have finished his career with this movie. This one is the worst in the franchise.",0
"I shuddered, but for the wrong reasons.: First off, let me say that I love horror films and remakes as such, but this has to be one of the most horrific movies I have viewed recently (ironic, isn't it). The plot is uninteresting, there's too much of a gap between the ""scary"" scenes (which aren't even scary, just laughable), the casting is poor, the acting is below average, and that's just to say a few things. I'm glad that I got this as a free rental because I wouldn't have wanted to waste any money on this. It's bad enough that I wasted an hour and a half of my time watching this garbage. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. I wouldn't recommend this under any circumstances. They ought to be ashamed of themselves creating this because The Ring was a fantastic movie and The Grudge was a decent movie. If you want to see a movie of this type that's done well, try The Eye with Jessica Alba. I was interested the entire time and the characters were believable.",0

Sketchers Women's Premium Sneaker: I bought this sneaker as a gift to my lovely wife. She love it. The most comfortable sneaker she ever used. Price is reasonable for a fine sneaker like this one.,1
A slow starter: I've read a couple of Vonnegut novels and have fallen in love with his style of writing from the very beginning. He's is the first author i've had the pleasure of reading where i'm not consistently looking ahead to see how many pages are left in the book. Every book that i've read by him i find myself upset when the story is done. Player piano is no exception. Since I enjoyed Vonnegut's books so much i figured i'd start with his first published novel. This book started off slow but it wasn't tough to follow the story line and stay somewhat interested. By the end of the book i found myself in awe of Vonnegut's insight of the human race. He seems to be able to see the world from a much higher plateau. One part i found particularly interesting was after the rebellion the only listed injuries to the immediate crew were caused by them trying to tame their own people from causing too much harm to the city. Overall a very enjoyable reading experience .... now it's on to Sirens of Titan.,1
"Flat greek bouzouki tunes: Dimitriou gets a lot more attention for her outragous interviews and arguements with b-class greek celebrities than for her music these days . Listening to "" Kane Stin Akri "" makes it easy to understand why . It's bad written , it's been done before and frankly it's quitte charmless . Her heavy , 'laiki' voice is surely a rare delight for many of her fans in this country but it's not enough to elevate releases like this one to an interesting level .",0
Comfortable Crocs: I bought the beach a month ago and now i'm a huge fan of crocs products. I just bought the new velocity for work and just more quality from a great new brand. I can not believe how comfortable crocs are. I questioned crocs in the beginning now I'm hooked. The new shoes coming out are amazing ex. Santa Cruz.,1
"Very Good Read: Very good story. I had the end figured out about halfway thru the book. However, I still could not put the book down until the end. This is really another wonderful book by Suzanne Brockmann. All of her books are very good. Highly recommend this book and most if not all of her others.",1
"Is the widescreen version lost forever?: This is one of my favorite films. Luckily, I got to see it twice on the big screen during its original release.

"I was unexpectedly disappointed: Yes, this doll is durable and has a classic face. I was disappointed though by the ""dog squeaker"" inside the doll's belly to make a crying sound. It is literally the same sound my dog's toys make. Also, the doll's right eye is stuck shut more often than not. I had read, prior to my purchase, in another customer review that they had this same problem but I was swayed by the other overwhelming positive reviews. I will be returning this overpriced one-eyed dog toy. The fancy name brand doesn't make up for the price.",0
Good resource: This is a very short book giving an overview of what not to do during your years as a medical student and especially during the application and interview process. It is up to date as of the ERAS and computer matches and helps to steer clear of many common pitfalls. The advice is not however very detailed or far reaching and the same can be found in other sources.,1
"Not the best Ana & Ravi have done: I am a huge fan of Ana and Ravi's. I find when I switch my workouts to more weight or even cardio intensive with less kundalini yoga, I miss their workouts and have to change my routine around again to fit in more! Maybe this routine is better for beginners who really do need a slower pace. After any of the other Ravi/Ana workouts, I feel like I've had a really challenging workout. This is the only one where I just don't feel that way. I don't feel particularly stretched, strengthened or challenged.I like Ana's singing, but I do find it distracting during the meditations-- especially when I'm supposed to be focusing on my pulse.If you're looking for a more energetic practice, I wouldn't recommend this one. I am a big fan of their original For Beginners and Beyond, Bliss Hips, & Fat Free Yoga.",0

"Thoroughly Boring and Blah: I was excited when I heard that DMB was coming out with a new album. I went out and got it right away. Now I cant even stand to listen to over half of the songs. Before These Crowded Streets was a little letdown, but still very good. This is boring, uninspired, rehash, resting on laurels album.There are a couple of good tunes in there, but nothing to buy this album for. If you are in question, pass this one up. I found U2's and David Gray's albums walked all over this one. I hope they can do better next time.",0
"Breathtaking!: What a wonderful journey! Middlesex took me a week to read...I could've done it in a day but was determined to savor every moment. Written so beautifully that I not just endured incest and numerous other unconventional sexual situations but in the end, had me rooting for everyone involved. I can't say enough about this book...just read it!",1
Good information: Good detail and a great number of organizations makes this a decent addition to anyone's FR library.,1
"Not enough Ray Park...: Liked it that he didn't say a word and did a lot of chop-socky.Other than that, this movie was awful. Love the fact that even though Parks' character Shadow (I think that's the characters' name) didn't have much air time, he's larger than the rest of the gang on the cover. This of course shows you that the company knew that my assessment of the show was correct and are hoping that the audience who Did Not see the movie in the theater will buy this because they see a 'sorta' ninja on the cover and think that he's the actual Star of the movie!They're making a movie on silly games like 'Astroid' and 'Battleship' which shows you how desperate hollyweird is nowadays. 'GI joe' is on that weird coin too.",0
"Nice: I gotta say that my music taste goes in pretty much any direction that doesn't lead to speed metal or cheesy country music. I was at work when I got the chance to listen to free music online so I chose this album based on one song I'd heard: '1234'. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire thing. Some songs are a bit slow for my taste, but it's a good accomplishment when an artist actually has more than 3 good songs on their album. Nice to just chill out to.",1
"Poorly Written: Hard to read, the author injects sloppy humor and anecdotes into the history. Making fun of historical figures, joking about religions and using sentences that are broken up by multiple parentheses.Too bad I didn't read the reviews before I spent the money....There is still some good info there but it's too much hassle to pick out the serious writing from the personal opinions",0
"Now junkyard crap: We had this set for 3.5 years. Used in in my hubby's man cave. One day suddenly picture was gone, but we had sound.

"It's in the telling: It goes without saying I enjoyed the book's plot, mystery, and historical aspect. But the thing that truly impressed me the most was the format and style in which it was written. It was refreshing to have the ""flashbacks"" interwoven with the contemporary setting without so much as an extra paragraph break, let alone a new chapter! It really kept me on my toes and kept things suspenseful. I have read one other book by Anita Shreve, Strange Fits of Passion, and was impressed with its unique format also. (First person accounts from several different characters, under the guise of being interviewed for a magazine.) There are plenty of good stories out there, but what can make the difference in which ones you spend your time with is the manner in which its told. Keep them coming!",1
Amazing woman: A little slow in the beginning and then becomes increasingly fascinating. To have lived this independent life in the time she lived was what was so interesting .,1
"Meg Ryan is worthless and so is this 'film': Does anyone really think she's worth a hoot? She has to be the lamest of the lame as far as Hollywood names go, and that says a lot. Sure, she's all cutesy wootsy, but this movie, and everything else she's ever been in, prove what morons the viewing public are. This movie is a horrendous take of a good but overrated film (""Wings of Desire"") and everyone trips all over themselves to proclaim it touching and moving.If you want touching and moving, visit some ailing people at the hospital (REAL ones, not the celluloid variety). If you want painful overacting garbage, see ""City of Angels.""",0
"And they dare to call this a romance novel.: I'm old fashioned in the heart matters, when I read a romance novel, I expect to find the hero and heroine to fall in love with each other. In this story, I'm not even sure whether they did fall in love. Oh well, three pages before it ends, the three sacred words are said, but the essence of love itself is just not there. BM seemed to be in a hurry to finish the book. After reading about 180 pages, I was told, there... they are in love, end of story. Such a contrary to BM's best: Angel Bride, Bride in the Ranch, etc.",0
"Never Again Will I buy These: Bought these for my Olympus digital camera. Not only did I get the least amount of use time with them, but they also do not hold a charge well.After many attempts to discharge them totally and then recharge, I finally gave up and threw them away since they were worthless. Just before they died completely they were totally dead out of the charger and I hadn't even used them that much.",0
"Childhood Memories: When I was a small child I would go to the library and check this book out every time! I loved jellybeans and this was the perfect book for me! I haven't seen it for many years, but I would have to say that it is my favorite childrens book because it reminds me that reading can take you places that the TV can't. The pictures and words can stay in your heart for years and years and make you feel special every time you think about them. I'm 29 years old now and have never forgotten ""Jellybeans for Breakfast""! I would love to find this book to share with my 4 children ages 5 months to 9.",1
Interesting: Definitely a strange and thought provoking film. The book is much more terrifying---especially for young teens. I had excellent quality on my television when I streamed it. The animation was excellent!,1
"No thread: A few short, ""creepy"" vignettes without an overarching theme. Although I love low budget, this movie reaches for a different level and outdistances itself with some hokey CGI.",0
"Careless editing spoils a potentially interesting storyline: Despite Kavanagh's credentials in the author notes, CAPABLE OF MURDER is poorly plotted with numerous misspellings and thousands of unneeded adverbs and adjectives that any student writer would know better than to use. Either the writer is careless or the editor was unqualified. This book reads like a badly written romance novel and lacks cohesion. Suddenly the heroine is driving a car in a rain storm but the reader is never told how she came to have a car. This will teach me never to buy a book by this author or this publisher again.",0
"Great CD: You know that a CD is really good when you can listen to it and not have to skip a song. I really love the Cranberries; this was their second CD that I bought. As of now, I have four of their CDs. On this CD, I especially love the songs ""Dreams"" and ""Sunday."" This is a wonderful CD!",1
"Oh, give me a break!: Hey folks, this is a very interesting read. But pay it no more creedence than you would any other work of fiction. I give this book one star, not because of it's lackluster showmanship, but rather that it masquerades as the truth that it is clearly not. Garrison relies heavily on evidence that has been discounted, witnesses that have been shown to be uncredible, and enough hearsay to drown a fish. The problem with this book is that people read it and think that it is in some way a definitive source on the Kennedy assassination. It is most certainly not, you would be well advised to do more research on the subject before taking this work of fiction at face value. An excellent suggestion is the highly researched book Case Closed, by Gerald Posner, who took the time to check his sources. Posner also spends a good deal of time addressing Garrison's, as well as other conspiracy theorist's, ""evidence.""",0
"Hendrix Heaven: For those interested in an easy to read and fun review of Hendrix discography and bio this book is a great resource. It is exhaustively researched, and contains tons of information about the most creative artist ever to touch a guitar. The true afficianato will find it an invaluable resource to review your collection against the master list, and decide what you can't live without next. How all of this information got pulled together is beyond me. Worth the time and $$.",1
"Eeeww.. hated it: My baby does like this video, but I can't stand it. I first purchased Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven and liked them a lot, but when my daughter got older (6 months) I decided to try something new. So I bought her some of the Fisher Price videos. She loves them, and I do too. Then I decided to try this video because unlike Mozart and Beethoven they actually have nature scenes and stuff in this video. My daughter is entertained, but the way they try to make the kids in this video all ""cutesy"" is annoying. The kids in the Fisher Price videos are very cute. They're filmed doing many different activities, playing with moms and dads, sleeping, eating. Very cute. But the kids in this video are always mugging for the camera - a complete turn-off for me. So, I gave this video two stars because it definitely entertains my daughter. But only two stars because I can't stomach it myself.",0

"THIS IS NOT NONSTICK!: Upon receiving this grill/griddle, we proceeded to cook bacon the next morning. Using the current bacon press we have, the bacon stick terribly. It is also very hard to clean, still looks like there is food that will not come off. We have used many nonstick brands, some better that others and there biggest problem is that they scratch and don't last, but they are far better than this grill/griddle. The advertisement states that it is better that nonstick. Very false advertising as far as we are concerned!",0
"This machine sucks: I saw this bread maker and I thought wonderful looking and all the features awesome. I can do great things with this machine. I got mine today. i did everything the book said. added the ingredients exactly as the book said and plugged it in. the LCD did not light up. but i heard a click. So i plugged it out and tried another outlet. Heard a click again and nothing. It wouldn't even beep. Well i am returning mine and after reading of the heart aches of the other bread making persons here. I will get a different bran. Black and Decker or something. B&D doesnt go with the decor, but I am sure I will not have this let down.",0

"For real movie fans a gotta have: For all the people who gave this 1 or two stars and made pointless comments.....wrong !If you are expecting 2012 Animations and a serious and strong plot....90's movies are NOT FOR YOU.These are action comedies with terrible punch lines and extra cheese on top of them. This movie is as great as when I first watched it when I was 13 years old. I love it.If you are looking for Matrix or Minority Report or I Robot, this is not for you. If you are a fan on Stallone, if you want to remember what entertained us 20 years ago and enjoy an old school action scifi comedy, you want to get this movie !I love watching old movies no matter how cheese they are just to remind me that it did not take very much to be entertained back in the day. And to see what cars clothes and hair styles people used to have is Epic hahah.Judge Dredd 5 star. I care not that it's not follow the comic this is NOT the first movie to do so.",1
"YOU guys don't get it: Of course they put them out in piece like this...they make more money this way. Most fans buy them piecemeal, and then in whole sets. And mostly, this release schedule is to catch parents in stores like Target and Best Buy, not for collectors. When little Johnny wants to put a cartoon in the cart, mom is much more likely to pay 10 bucks rather than 30. Once they feel they've tapped that market, THEN they put out the full set, sometimes on Bluray, so they can get YOUR money. These guys are marketing geniuses with JOBS for a reason. They know how to exploit you and I to make money.",0

"Horrible for long audio files: The player is awful if you are using it to listen to lectures; it only recognizes 25 minutes of an mp3. Plus, the fast forward function is EXTREMELY slow (to fast forward 10 mins would take about 3-4 minutes of holding down the button).Otherwise, it plays music fine, though the software on the mp3 player is no where near as nice as what you get with ipods (e.g. if you pull the headphones out of the jack it will pause the file, or it will remember the exact location in a file where you last left off instead of restarting a file if you turn the player off), but on the flip side it is also significantly cheaper.Overall, you get what you pay for.",0
"Great product and a great price!: Well, not much I need to say about Bushwacker- they are known all over for their fender flares. I got mine and they certainly look like a quality item. I test fit them to my truck and they look like they should fit like a glove, which is something you don't always get with molded plastic, and it looks like a very simple install. These things will look great once I get them installed.I also must add that Amazon has the absolute best price I was able to find on these flares-ANYWHERE-and with free shipping to boot!",1
"Don't Bother: I haven't read a book this bad in years. I skimmed the last 150 pages. The plot develops into a story so unbelievable, it became laughable. I couldn't believe it managed to include not one but two story lines involving hot teenage babysitters attracted to middle age men. Who are these people? I have limited time to read pleasure books so I have to choose very carefully. If you fall into that category - skip this one!",0

"Civil War Insight: I enjoyed Zeiss's first historic novel. His depiction of 'real people' and their struggles to perform a patriotic duty (General Will Wallace and Ann), as well as live a life that involves love, challenges, and a desire to fulfil a complete life brought home a message of who we should be and how we should carry on with strength and dignity. The description of each character enabled me to 'feel' the environment in which each participated...the strong and the weak.",1

"Works as expected: My baby outgrown the Summer Infant swaddles in length by 2mo. This sack works well as long as you keep the swaddle flaps 1-2 inches below the shoulders, or be sure the hands are tucked in so the arms cannot push up the flaps to gather around the neck. The material is soft and washes well. However, a strong baby will likely be able to slide his arms out of the swaddle rather easily. My baby is about 24 to 25 inches long and the sack still has ample room. It works well.",1
"*** Don't Bother ***: I'll start by saying I didn't buy this, but I did watch every episode as they broadcast. Although the show was great, if you buy it, you'll be greatly disappointed to find, as many NBC series go, there was no ending to it. It is one that they left completely open for the next season but cut the show in the off season and left most of the questions of the show unanswered.",0
Revlon Dolls and Their Look-Alikes: This book was like a trip back in time. I saw pictures of dolls that I played with and dreamed of owning. Recently I have been purchasing some of the dolls of my childhood to collect and display. The book is essential to help verify the authenticity of what I am buying. Is a dress truly a Revlon outfit or a copy? I enjoy referring to the book on many occasions. Kathy did an excellent job in documenting the history of Revlon dolls for doll collectors.,1
"Great Photography and Film Work!: The film work of the animals is amazing! My son (19 months) thoroughly enjoys this one! Contrary to another reviewer, my son LOVES the turtle/fish/dolphin song. It is catchy and he usually does some head bobbing or clapping to it. This DVD is a bit shorter with not many extras, but the photos are great and I have fun watching it with him! Check it out at the library to give it a test run to see what your little one thinks before buying!",1

"Broke within the first year: I bought this coffee maker at Target. I did not like the fact that most standard coffee pods such as Folgers, Senseo, etc. do not fit this coffee maker. Nevertheless, I was able to find a giga-pack of Melitta's brand and propper size pods.The coffee machine stopped working shortly after a year, when an internal hose broke, and the hot water would just drip all over the counter. So much for this disposable coffee maker !",0
"My Favorite!: Empire of the Sun is Spielberg's most underrated film and my favorite. Some of the subtle nuances of this film make it special. Each piece of dialog is important. The boy's reciting of poetry to his doctor/teacher as the Americans are liberating POW's still haunts me, as does the musical score. Chritian Bale and John Malkovich give exceptional performances. Steven Spielberg is truly a genius.",1

"The Alaska River Guide:Canoeing, Kayaking, and Rafting in the Last Frontier: I have read many river guides and find this one to be little help in any whitewater decents. I would instead try to find the out-of-print book ""Fast and Cold"" for information that contains valuable whitewater information. The Alaska River Guide is a book for someone who needs general directions and an incredibly broad overview of the larger picture. Details and maps are incredibly vague to the point one wonders if the author actually ran the rivers described.",0
"Heavy Duty Breakdown: Heed these warnings my fellow consumer and from one who did not do so in time let me say this ""heavy"" (ha) duty grinder fell apart after only a moderate amount of use - stripping the top storage area from the ground bottom section making it virtually useless (maybe I can convert it into a fly catcher?) ugh...avoid!",0
The Perfect Prince: Very enjoyable book. The 1st book in the series was my least favorite but this book & the rest in this series have been really good. I've also enjoyed the other series of books about the Var who are cat shapeshifters that rule the other half of the planet. I really like the series on the Var a little bit more.,1
"Great teaching tool!: Coulter's book made teaching my unit on logical fallacies a breeze! Even the slowest students easily identified countless hasty generalizations, ad hominem attacks, false analogies, non sequiters, and more--all within a couple of pages! Were adult readers as astute, Coulter's deeply flawed ""arguments"" wouldn't muster a passing grade--let alone a bestseller.",0
"Good biography of JFK, Jr.: Though the title is deceiving-the book opens and ends with his death, the remainder on his life-I enjoyed this book. I have read numerous books on the Kennedy family, and this biography tells the Kennedy story best. I was, however, disappointed there was not more on his wife, Carolyn or her sister Lauren since the title encompassed their death, also. I truly feel anyone reading this book will get a true picture of the man JFK, Jr. was, from premature birth to death.",1
".amazing!!!!!: this is like the best movie ever!!!mary elizabeth winstead acted amazing.its simply amazing it was very entertaining and its very unexpected!!!! i was practically shaking on the ride of the rollercoaster.the graphics are amazing,the acting too this movie has everything suspense gore and great characters which are not dumb except for the annoying frankie.the version of the dvd has a choose their destiny option where you can make choices in the movie to change some destinies for example if u decide to honk twice in the scene where frankie dies he turns around and the protagonists now its him so they save him and in the coin flip if u choose the correct choice you can save wendy boyfriend and her best friend but everyone else dies in the crash makiing the movie end and of course some alternate death scenes and endings.this movie is the definately must buy its the best of the 3 and it comes full package",1
"incorrect grammar but.....: My son's teachers introduced him to Junie B. Jones. He loves them and so do I. Junie B.'s grammar is awful and she often makes lousy decisions but my son corrects her and if he doesn't I do while we read. If no one tells children that something is improper, they might try it. Junie B. brings up lots of things that give us reason to discuss her behavior. We always figure out a better way for her to behave by the end of each chapter and get a good laugh while we do it. I would give these books more stars if I could.",1
"Coro has awesome dance mixes that you can really move to!!!: This CD is a wonderful dance compilation. The songs really make you want to move and sing along.

"Palmieri's best?: how can anybody call this ""The Best of Palmieri"", if you've heard songs like: muñeca, Mi lindo Yambu, Palo pa Rumba and albums like: Mozambique and Champagne, you'd agree with me that this one is just another record. I'd recommend you left this one behind and go for another one, the only remarkable thing here is a track called ""Ritmo Alegre"" sung by Cheo Feliciano and that would be the only fact to get it, honestly that's a great one, nice arrangement and a superb Cheo's performance but that's all. You had better get choosing another Palmieri's album.",0

"A modest yet very entertaining movie: I first saw ""Dragonslayer"" when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981. It was the first VHS movie I ever purchased. It's very well made, an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about. It still holds up. Caitlin Clarke's performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job. I wrote her when the film came out telling her as much, and received a hand-written thank you letter. I learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004. ""Dragonslayer"" has action, humor, humanity, political irony. And if none of those matter to you: it's just plain fun!",1
"Satire on Culture, Art, Pretense and Manners: This is a wonderful satire on culture, art, pretense and manners.The story is about some culturally well-placed Brits who are mourning the death of their expatriot American lover.McEwan is a good writer with a great eye for connecting things, using the segue without the reader being aware of any artificial change of person, time and place. Through his characterization, he is able to show the self-centeredness and outright ridiculousness of what we hold collectively meaningful.I recommend this book for a good read and and some thoughtful laughs.",1

"Very hard to follow the steps: Positives: her voice is not the least bit annoying; the music is good; it's not at all boring; and it really does seem to work. I am definitely dropping inches off my waist.Negative: I do martial arts, and I have always been very quick to pick up steps in classes like Zumba. But I found these videos damn near impossible to follow. I end up doing about half the moves, because I have no idea what she's saying (there's something like a ""Fireman throw,"" but I'm still not sure what she's calling it). I finally figured out a few moves and combinations, but she switches so fast, and switches her reps without warning, that just when I think I've got it, I realize she's on something totally new. Even the ""breakdown"" goes so fast... well, good luck. About half the time I just end up punching the air going, ""WTF? Oh well. Just keep moving.""",1

"get a grip!: I actually have not read this book, but have been dissuaded from doing so by the prior reviews. To future readers of the reviews, I ask: what does the fact that there really WERE soviet spies have to do with McCarthy? Shouldn't it be clear to everyone (since at most 1 or 2 of the people he accused had any actual connection to the soviets) that we can, and should, despise McCarthy for his grandstanding and destruction of the lives of innocent people, while also condemning the real spies?from the other reviews, it appears to me that the authors don't think so, and that's why I have decided not to read the book.",0
"excellent book: In my opinion is one of the best introductory book in statistical thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening.",1
"What's the big deal?: I have put off reading this book since my college days but felt that I should give it a try since I see it on so many must-read lists for literature. What a waste of time. The story was dry and boring and never captured my interest. The only reason that I finished it was because it was only 207 pages, so I decided to just suffer through it. A classic? Not in my book.",0
"good starting point: Having learned Buddhism while growing up in Thailand, my knowledge was based largely on the practice of the religion itself, not the man. This book not only offers good insight into the life of the Buddha, but also the basic history of the axial religions. This book would be beneficial to anyone wanting to expand there knowledge about the religions of the world.....",1
"An Absolute Must!: I loved this book! As much as it disturbed me that this girl would become pregnant at fourteen, even though she didn't plan on it, I couldn't put this book down. Every teen thinking about having sex with her boyfriend should read this book. If it doesn't change your mind, it would at least encourage you to use protection, and it would show you the consequences if you didn't. This book also shows you that protection isn't 100% guarenteed. Another reason I loved this book was because Annie battled with the idea of abortion and decided not to go with it. She ended up keeping her baby, and I think that was a very honorable thing.",1
Yay i found it on DVD: I have been looking for this on DVD for awhile and I found it at Amazon.com for a great price.,1

"Quality has declined...: I have become greatly dissapointed McDonell's work in recent years. In the first couple of collections, Mutts was right on target, witty and fresh, but now it seems that Mutts has become preachy, and cloyingly sweet. Most of us already have helpless guilt from reading newspaper articles on vanishing tigers, do we really need it in a comic strip? Even the artwork seems lacking, as if McDonell was late for a deadline and did a rush job. The Mutts creator definitely needs new ideas.",0
Good value.......: Can't beat the price of this as it's well worth it and it makes delicious tea once you get the hang of it.,1
Awesome: This book came in perfect condition and came promptly. It was just as they said and I am extremely happy about my purchase.,1
"A big disappointment.: This book teaches almost nothing about sound processing. The writing style is bad, actually this is a monolog of a DSP expert showing off what he knows. There's no one subject that he explains well. He assumes that the reader has technical knowledge in many subjects that are outside the scope of the book. for example, in one section were he describes quadrature sampling, he just throws that it's better then using wavelets. Wavelets are not explain anywhere in the book though... The book is filled with senteces like the above. Even worse, most of the time the autor talks about programming for windows, MFC, code optimizations and GUI - Subjects not very related to Audio DSP. The author seems to be a very talented guy, but he doesn't know how to write books. Don't buy it.",0
"Decent movie: The fighting was just kind of there early in this. It starts out introducing this guy as one of Wong Fei-Hung's famous students. From here on we get to know the bad guy. While really boring, this guy makes it worthwhile by hirign a couple of really tough guys to take out Wong Fei-Hung's student and his friends. He says that he will pay them $300 a month and will give them 3 months in advance. For one job? I guess the director was lettign us know he is rich. Anyways, one of the guys can REALLY kick and I think that I recognize him as Fong Yeh's son from 10 Magnificent Killers. Sadly he only has about 5 minutes of fighting time. The movie isn't really worth going over but Bruce Liang deals out some sweet kicks at the end. I was just glad that it had some decent kung fu, casue the first hour or so of the movie had none.Picture quality in the 50 pack this came in was ok.",0

"This is BT's worst effort yet.: BT has finally cemented in my mind that he has lost all relevancy in today's dance music culture. 'This Binary Universe' sounds more like a movie score than an artist album from one of the most highly acclaimed electronic music producers of all times.Yes I understand that movie scoring is what BT 'does' now - and that's fine. but for the love of god don't classify this as dance music and sell it under that guise. If you labeled this CD as New Age and sold it as such, I wouldn't have a problem with it.If you want essential BT, pick up IMA and ESCM. Both are absolute landmarks.",0

"DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!: This vacuum sucks and I don't mean that literally, because 97% of the time it is useless! If you buy this vac, forget about waking up on a Saturday morning expecting to accomplish some house cleaning. I just turned the thing on and vacuumed ten square feet of my hardwood floor and it overheated. Each time it overheats, you need to let it cool down, which takes about an hour and then you have to go back, vacuum another tiny area, weep as it putters out again, wait another hour, and begin the process again. It has literally taken all week for me to vacuum my bare floors. Is there something caught in the nozzle or hose, you ask. Definitely not. I have checked more times than I can count. Hoover may have had he right idea, but this product fails miserably in my book. I give it a G!",0

Looks like a Toy and not worth the price: Flimsy. I don't normally wear watches and just needed one for clinical rotations. Cloded up when I got cold water on the outside of the clear plate of the face. I think I spent like $10 with shipping; I ended up buying another more expensive watch.,0
"bemused and confused......: ...by some of the reviews above - this is an important piece of work by one of the few great songwriters working today; a concept work, a musical, based on a true life tragedy from late 50's n.y. gang life; some stunningly beautiful songs - ""sunday afternoon"", ""born in puerto rico"", ""time is an ocean"" - but more importantly a beautifully evocative story in music and lyrics; all credit to paul simon for taking the bold step of turning his talent to the musical form, and succeeding. bravo.",1

"Dull Bach Performances: It is hard to be enthusiastic about these performances , especially when superior versions exist. The balances and tempi are usually wrong in Rilling, which is always disappointing. The Suzuki and Gardiner performances are so superior in every way... And for me the clincher is the clotted dull choral sound. One wants to like these performances because the pieces are so good , but instead all that is left is total disappointment.....",0

I am shocked to see someone commercializing on attacking the beliefs of Christianity by making a mockery of the ICHTHUS symbol. The vampyre and Darwin items need to be removed. I would have rated this item a zero but the only option given me was one star. Very disappointing.,0
"DON'T BUY THIS CD!: I wasted my money on this CD. I liked ""Blue"" for a while, but now, it's kinda annoying hearing the same song over and over, so I don't like it anymore. If you LOVE techo music (which i don't really) you might look into buying it, but if you're not into techno, don't buy it.",0

Striker 2 strikes out!: I bought this for a gift. The idea is right-on. And everything works well until you shoot the missles. The fun stops there -- first there is a longish wait before the firing mechanism releases and then the missle only travels about 3 feet. Too bad!,0
"Best U.S. Release since ""Dummy""!!!: A MUST FOR ALL ""P"" FANS!!! A someone who has seen this band live more than once, I highly recommend this recording. Their live performances always surpass their studio efforts, and this album is no exception! The PNYC version of ""Sour Times"" is one of the best I have heard, Beth Gibbons' vocals on this one blow me away! ""Over"" and ""Roads"" are tracks to check out as well. I conclusion, if you love this band, as I do, YOU NEED THIS ALBUMN! The Portishead experience is best savored LIVE!!!",1

"Simply Awful: This is the saddest of all pop music that I have ever heard. Who allowed this to be broadcast on the radio? I am not a pop hater, I like most music, and I even respect Justin Timberlake as a talented singer-- but come on! All JC does in this song is yell and make a lot of unpleasant noise! The trumpets in the background, combined with his yelling, make this sound like a freak circus.",0

"Great Study Buddy: Who needs a person to study with when your book asks you questions? This book is structured in a Q&A format. It also comes with the audio for the book. Simple and concise this book is a great study aid for anyone taking pharmacology. The book goes over adverse effects, drug kinetics. and general concepts plus more. I use this book along with ""Pathophysiology Made Easy"" to get a better idea of the whole picture.",1

"Fibromyalgia for Dummies: I have suffered from fibromyalgia for over 20 years, and like many others who have this syndrome, I often have doubts myself, when so many friends and relatives do not ""believe in"" this disease, and infer that if I would just try this diet, or do these exercises, or ""just try harder""... I sometimes wonder if I AM just lazy, or ""not trying hard enough"".This book helped me so much to understand and validate my experiences---the sometimes vague---sometimes acute pain that lasts for months in one part of my body, then suddenly moves to another area.I shared it with my caregiver, who is close to me, and it helped her to understand that which she did not understand before.This is a wonderful book that every sufferer of ""fibro"" should own, and every caring family member or friend should read. It is not ""all in our heads"". It is real, and it is progressive, and it is at times extremely painful. And, there are treatments for it, as clearly delineated in this book.",1

"Good for kids, not so much for adults: I found the ""storyline"" to be monotonous and found myself getting up to take a quick break -- without hitting pause -- and I didn't miss much. The characters are cute and loveable, and there is some comedy and even some adventure, but they didn't last nearly long enough. The DVD does include some cute extras about the squirrel/rat that doesn't talk (Scrat) and ""Bunny"". Great cast - Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary. It's a shame they wasted their time on this movie.",0
"Perfectly Simple Gentle Toothbrushes!: I've searched far and wide for years for toothbrushes as simply gentle as these! I was never happy with other brushes I found, and stopped my hunt when I found these. The curved handle was easy to get used to and the simple travel tube it comes in is also a plus. I can't imagine anyone not being as pleased with these great toothbrushes as we are. I do believe that these are made in the USA, which is another wonderful plus!",1

I had checked locally at Office Depot and Office Max and decided on the eight outlet Belkin surge protector after looking at several models and brands. I checked next on-line and bought the same unit from Amazon for around $15 less than it retailed for at those two stores, plus no freight or tax. It is working fine for her.",1

"good source of hot topic: It seems that over the past few years, the topic of globilization aond free trade have become hot topics because of events like the WTO protests in Seattle, the World Bank protests in DC and Ralph Nader's run for the presidency in 1996 and 2000.Has globilization gone too far? is a good source for those people trying to find out more about the issue because it shows what happens under globilization both theoritically and in real life. It presents the arguements against free trade and the problems associated it with it like loss of jobs and capital outflows so it is good to understand the oposing view.",1
"Just Plain Good Music: Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers.

"well-organized and powerful/life-affirming works: Damien Sturt's ""Taste Your Emotions"" is an accessible, engaging and well-presented journey through the thoughts and feelings of someone struggling with drug addiction and the challenges of making major changes with one's life. As someone who works with dual diagnosis clients (people diagnosed with substance abuse and mental health disorders) I recognized many of the patterns of thinking, and the raw emotions that Damien presented in his early works, and was inspired as the poems went on to present hope and the challenges faced by new-found sobreity. The poem ""Relapsing Nightmare"" from the Chemical Life chapter was a powerful piece about the tumultuous early days of early recovery, and the poem ""Sweet Life"" was a very poignant and affirming tale of strength. I look forward to introducing these poems to the people I work with, as well as to anyone else who doubts the impact that writing, reading, and sharing poetry can have on one's life.",1

"A wonderful feel good family movie!: Even if you're not a big sports fan, this is great family movie! I always enjoy movies based on a true story and this one is exceptional. This story is based on the coaching career of Cathy Rush, who turns a small girl's Catholic college upside down with her modern ways, and raises a few eyebrows along the way. But when she takes the underdog girls basketball team all the way to the national championships, those who previously doubted her begin to take notice. The team faces so many challenges and yet somehow they manage to stick together and support each other.This is a clean, feel good movie that is about courage, teamwork, change and never giving up. I really enjoyed it.",1
First rate acting: I stumbled across this movie and had just seen Fillion in Waitress. I enjoyed his acting for the second time. His stiff 'professional man in love' act was great in Waitress and his 'average man with moral compass and responsibility to his fellow man' act was right on target in this movie Waters Edge as well. I like watching an actor who can be an every man in many different stories. The story kept me intrigued enough to be entertained and I do hope to see Fillion make it big as he ages.,1
"Not Great: This is a decent sub-1Megapixel camera if you aren't too concerned about color. It doesn't get colors right at all. Plus, the time to process a picture is way too long. Don't use the included software for the camera - go to the Largan web site and download the twain driver. Additionally, the pictures are always overexposed with the flash. My advice; don't bother.",0

"A little corny...: This was the first Nora Roberts novel I've read and most likely the last. It started off strong and interesting. However, I found the characters to be non-believable. They were portrayed as too perfect and ideal for real life. The author doesn't give each character time to develop. Therefore, in each of the trilogies, there is an abrupt transition from when the couples first meet each other to when they end up together. The simple plots and unrealistic characters insult the readers intelligence. Also, I don't think there was enough variety in the vocabulary. Certain words such as ""tug"" and ""good stock"" were used over and over, to the reader's annoyance. A good editor might have picked up on these.",0

"Its a good gag gift: I bought this cause I thought it would be neat. The beer smelled great and you get to learn a lot about how beer is made. After a day of the beer being in the barrel I noticed a small leak by the spigot. You have to sanitize everything and I wasn't sure what to put the beer in to retighten the spigot. Well, I got it all out and went to tighten it more and it broke. It also said in the book that you have to put sugar in the beer when you bottle it to carbonate it, which I thought was odd... but I never got that far. I thought this was an ok item and was a good starting point. I have since upgraded to a nicer system with Co2 cartridges for carbonation.",0
"Wonderful!!: I am the mother of a 2 year old and of 4 month old healthy boy/girl twins. This book is great and I highly recommend it for all women that are pregnant with mutiples! A multiple pregnancy is nothing like a single pregnancy and this book guides you step by step on what to do to have a healthy multiple pregnancy. My twins were delvered at 39 weeks and weighed 7,4 and 5,8. They are very healthy and came home with me. I am a small person ( 5'3, 105 lbs) and followed this book to the end. Thank you Barbara Luke for sharing your knowledge!!",1
"Disgusting. Alas - I may not find milder word.: No understanding of midieval times at all. Lots of holes in the story. Dull charactres. Awful acting.I feel very disappointed by rate received by this movie. It seems, one rusty sword is equal to success in our times.Few good episodes (like ship approaching the beach in the fog) are not enough to justify wasted time and money.",0
"Hard to find at a good price: I needed to have a single gang wallplate to accommodate a mix of 1-way and 3-way switches, and the Despard brand is the only way to do it. This 3-way switch didn't come with any instructions, so I had to figure out on my own how to install each switch into the mounting strap that came with the triple wall plate. I used a screwdriver to bend the T's on the wall plate into each switch using a twisting motion, and it seems like that's how it was meant to work.Shipping from Grady's Online was quick, although it wasn't particularly well packaged to keep the 1-way and 3-way switches from tumbling around during shipping.",1
"Disappointed: I bought this to replace an older model because the plastic basket had gotten very worn. Unfortunatly this new one is more difficult to use because the plastic basket is very difficult to properly engage in the base. It seems that the plastic nubs that engage are just a bit too big, and every time I have to force it together I am afraid that I am going to crack the plastic basket.I loved the old model I had and that is why I replaced it with this one.I have been tempted to contact Black and Decker about this, but haven't so far.",0
"Better than Norton!: Whether you are a techie or relatively intimidated by the whole system maintenance thing, this product is for you! Perhaps the biggest plus for me was the speed. Diskeeper is one of the fastest defrag utilities available. In addition the ability to configure the software to defrag your drives while the computer is idle (During a screen saver running for example) makes this a great tool for your PC toolbox. In any event, don't take my word for it. You can download free trialware at www.diskeeper.com and try it for 30 days before you buy! You won't be disappointed! You'll need the professional edition if you run Windows XP Professional.",1
"Bad Copy: I have a bad copy of this DVD and no way to get another one. The store from which it was purchased was going out of business and had no other copies. The first feature plays just fine the second one plays on two of my five dvd players. but the third feature which is the main reason this disc was bought doesn't play on any of them. They will all play all types of DVD's and all CD's audio and video, one is an all region and one has the double layer technology. This DVD disc even says it is compatible with all DVD players worldwide. My cousin has two DVD players that are different from mine they won't play it either.All five of my DVD players are all different name brands.What am I gonna do except buy the movie ""Rock Hard Zombies"" by itself for more than this triple feachure was purchased.",0
"unwatchable garbage: don't let the cover or text sway you into thinking this is a neat monster/horror film. its not. its a very low budget attempt at horror directed by someone with no imagination on how to stretch the budget for max effect. most of the film takes places in the inside of what we're led to believe is a rig, but looks more like a high school attempt at creating a haunted house. the few outside scenes are purposely poorly lit and funkily shot to camouflage another pitiful attempt at creating a realistic set. the story, however, is the worst part. its generally non-existent, and a completely random excursion through meaningless dribble. and there's a few actors you'll recognize, but it'l take a while because you haven't seen any of them for 10+ years...for a reason. very disappointed.",0
"Arabesque: Arabesque is entertaining, however I would not consider it ""one of the best"". On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it a 7. Having said that, I would say to those who like action and suspense, you probably would enjoy this movie, though I believe it falls short of being outstanding.",1
"Thought this was great...BUT...: I have not had trouble with the software or printing as others have. However, after having played a labeled cd in my cd-rom drive, I now have a sticky, glue-like substance on the readable side (on the 1/2 inch area around the center) of the latest disc I used (and the one after that I used to try to figure out what in the world was going on). There is no chance of anything having been spilled on (nor in) my drive. The only thing I can think of is that the glue from the label heated up, label shifted and adhesive oozed. And it's entirely possible every disc I use now will end up with gobs of glue on it that rubbing alcohol won't even remove. I'm confused on how this can happen since the label is on the other side of the disc, disappointed and off to find some goo-gone. I will entertain a revised review if anyone can come up with suggestions on how to fix this or attribute the glue issue to something else.",0

"should have been at the check out stand of a grocery store: The book while entertaining, does not contain complete information. In some portions of the book, it quotes people who confessed to crimes and aberant behavior. In others it only addresses one side of the story. hence half information, half truth. Anything that is a half truth is at best a lie. The whole story should be published. In the section about the fire department, it only quotes some employees who have had axes to grind, and less than desireable employment histories. It does not interview or attempt to address the views of the people accused of the acts.",0

"Awful just awful: This music is incredibly dull and pointless not to mention Meade Skelton harassed numerous people on the internet to buy into his garbage that he's a great musician and he went on to verbally assault lots of people who didn't think he was as great as Elvis, a pathetic cd and an even more pathetic human being",0
"Intriguing: What a fascinating subject... This book reminds me of another favorite, ""Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name,"" by Vicki Hearne, which also focuses on communicating with animals. It combines animal training with philosophy, linguistics, and literary criticism. The Atlantic Monthly called it ""A fascinating and often surprising discussion of animal-human encounters."" If you are an animal trainer-- or even just an animal lover-- it's definitely worth checking out.",1
"Not Much Use: If you don't know the rules, are new to football, etc., this book might have value.The book is about 150 pages. The first 50 pages is dross, unless you are an absolute newbie. If you know the game at a basic level and want depth to help your flag team win some games, look elsewhere.",0
"Misfires Constantly: Received the 16 gauge angled finish nailer as a gift recently. Worked at first, then began to misfire with increasing frequency. Recharged batteries and new fuel cells don't help. Will have to take it to the service center soon, but from the other reviews I've read, I am not holding out much hope of a fix.I don't know the circumstances of folks who claim that their guns work, but Paslode is obviously seling a significant number of guns that don't work. It beats me why anyone would want to roll the dice on this device when a reliable alternative (i.e., pneumatic nail gun) is available. With such a high number of defective guns sold already, has there been a product liability class action of any sort initiated yet? This device is clearly not fit for its intended use.",0
"Disappointing and under developed: The first page turned me off, but I continued to read in hopes the author would develop her voice and make me feel something for her, her situation, her family- really anything. It just never happened. She may be a wonderful journalist, but a memoir shouldn't be written in such a removed voice. Even the ending didn't make me feel anything but frustrated. If the quality of the writing was better, I could at least think about the book as literature, but it is not worthy of it.",0
"wonderful invention: The quality of sound is amazing, by using the audio level indicator you can make recordings that sound even better than the original. LP's sound great even with the occasional record sounds, i.e. pops, cracks, etc. and 78 rpm records sound like a new recording entirely. It is so nice to be able to listen to 78's and lp's that rarely get played anymore, worth the price times two at least",1
"Not a bad book, but not what it seems: About three quarters of the way through this book, I was ready to throw it out the window. I am biased on the issue of Ronald Reagan, I am a huge fan of his. I wasn't angry just because the book was mostly in criticism of Reagan, but I didn't like that it showed more bad than good, and I think that that is unfair. However, after reading through the whole book (an encouraged practice before making a judgement, and writing a review), I found that, while I believe that Kenneth Walsh is anti-Reagan, he did an okay job of portraying the good side of Reagan as well, but by no means sufficient. I don't think that this book is what it says it is: an unbiased portrait of the Reagan legacy; but rather, a censure in disguise.",0
"Believe the Poor Reviews: We saw the mixed reviews and figured the poor reviews (as is often the case) were from people expecting perfection or who didn't know how to use the product. We apologize! We were originally impressed with the deep pockets and the fit. However, the skirt material began to shred almost immediately and after one washing developed 12"" rips every place we pulled on it. Imagine my frustration this morning when I tried to return them (we bought two) and found out I had missed the window by two days! These will end up being very expensive painting drop cloths. Why isn't there a zero star category??",0
"Wasn't what I expected at all: This was the first by the Dalia Lama that I've ever bought, was an impulse buy.

"Ineffective, overrated, and pricey product: I have been using this oil for the past six months or so since my hair was in a bad shape. There are some visible areas on my scalp where there has been a considerable hair loss. I was very diligent in my use of complexe 5 oil, but thus far have not seen any effects. In fact, I have experienced further hair loss. I understand that there are several reasons for one's hair loss, and may not be treatable by any one product, but I think this product is overrated and very pricey for what it claims to accomplish; it did not live up to its promise. This is like any other hair oil and may be substituted with other cheap, affordable alternatives such as olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, etc.",0
"3.5 Stars: In the decades that have passed since Aslan first got on the move, readers of all ages have been fascinated by the lands of Narnia created by Clive Staples Lewis. Inevitably, analysis has been applied to the books, finding the hidden meanings in the fantasy, debating whether fantasy is appropriate for Christians to read, and so forth. Finally, someone has gone in and examined the books, particularly the first volume, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, from as close to Lewis' own perspective as an outside observer can come. We get to see how Lewis conceived his world and what his intent actually was. Though the biographical details are not predominant, it is shown how they play into the story and what influenced the final results. Each chapter has discussion questions included, making this an ideal book for small group study, especially in light of the upcoming film.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer.",1

"Great show - no ending - don't buy it!: This is a fantastic show, stunning and exceptional SciFi ... that said, it has a major cliffhanger due to ABC canceling the series instead of giving it a third season finale arc. Unless you like a book with no ending, don't waste your money or time, you will be left wanting and likely will never get a finale. If another network buys it from Warner Brothers and continues it with a proper envtual finale - then by all means buy it, it is fantastic. If not, save your money for a show with a conclusion - in others words, wait and see - don't fall for this money grab without a guarantee of a conclusion. If a conclusion is made, I would rate this at 5 stars.",0
"We miss you Myron!: Like Primanti Bros. and pierogis, the Terrible Towel is an icon of Pittsburgh tradition. What a great way to commemorate the Steelers' 75th anniversary!

"Panasonic lightweight headphones: These are practical and low cost, and I appreciate the fact that the end that plugs into my laptop has a hard plastic end that allows for turning (thus less chance of damaging the wire, always a problem for me).

"Great value, but some extra care needed for acrylic.: This tank is a pretty good value and comes with pretty much everything that is needed to get started. One thing that I have found is that acrylic scratches very easily. I received the tank with a pretty nice scratch in one of the sides, but didn't notice until I had water in it. It is not bad enough for me to return it, but I have added a few small scratches when i was cleaning it up with a paper towel. The paper towel left a few very small scratches where I wiped up some finger prints from my son. I was able to buff them out with a microfiber cloth and some elbow grease, but I can see this tank will take a little extra care than glass.On a side note, the tank does seem much clearer than glass and i like it because it is also weighs less than a glass tank.",1

"Self-Absorbed and Immature: I disliked this book immensely. I found Ms. Moran to be self-absorbed and immature. Based on the way she presented herself in the beginning, I'm surprised that any professional organization hired her. There were many points where it appeared she was trying to be negative intentionally and came off as whining. Although she was applying for a government job that would require a clearance, she was ignorant of the procedures involved that the level of trust she would be given. Please do not read this book.",0

Also the included pillow case shrinks when washed and dried making it nearly impossible to put on the the pillow and once on it makes the pillow even stiffer being that it is stuffed into a pillow case that is too small. I am far from pleased with this purchase and now have to go through the hassle of returning it :(",0
"Yuck!: I saw this in the Grocery store this morning, and I thought 'Hey, why not get a healthy snack instead of these chocolate mint cookies right next to it?' Worst snack decision ever. Seriously.

"It Does Work: I am at the age when your hair starts to thin, the scalp shows in back, and you seem to lose a lot of hair when you comb or brush or wash it. I bought a bottle of Shen-Min at the drugstore when they were offering a free trial in the form of a full price rebate. Believe me, I would never have forked over $29 for a bottle of Chinese vitamins! But after giving it the one-month trial I was hooked. I definitely saw results, my hair was thicker and very little fell out. I've been using it about 2 years now and it continues to work (although you cannot discontinue it) . I started with the two a day regimen but now I use just one a day. I will mention, though, that you can find it cheaper on other websites if you buy more than one bottle at a time.",1

"Broken Globes: I ordered 3 of these. The electricians installed them, but one had a broken globe. I was told about the problem after they were installed. I sent it back and was sent a replacement. That one also arrived with a broken globe. I sent that one back and obtained a third one. That one was okay. I would not have kept the product except I had paid the electrician for his service call. Very disappointed with these lights.",0
"Classic NWOBHM: CLOVEN HOOF...That's it!For the longest time have I tried to remember the name of that band.I had that album on tape back in the mid 80's, and I remember liking it very much.It is raw, classic NWOBHM with a touch of Slayer's SHOW NO MERCY.Don't take it too seriously, because of course that kind of album didn't age very well, it suffers from a lack of production and if when it first came out, it was a bomb, many bands have now done better.It might even sound like a stupid cliche-album...but the fact is that they were there at the very beginning of speed-metal, and it didn't sound cliche in '84.This album is a must have along the line of RAVEN's Rock til you drop, SLAYER's Show no mercy or SATAN's caught in the act.Apparently this is not their only record, but they never made it to a higher level...and from what I've heard they pretty much went downhill afterwards...So enjoy that one.Originally released on NEAT RECORDS, a label of quality for those who like a good headbangin'",1
"Let your soul sing with Dances in the Mist: I find that not only do I listen to this CD repeatedly, but that I truly desire to listen to this CD repeatedly. Being both a full-time mom and student, I have found this CD to be relaxing and inspriational. I would encourage everyone to experience the music of Dances in the Mist!",1
Remains of the Day: Received the DVD very quickly however it was loose in the dvd jacket. It had a scratch on it. Don't know if it affected the performance because I haven't inquired about it. Hopefully it's ok. This was supposedly a new product.,0
"HORRIBLE SERVICE/HORRIBLE PRODUCTS!!!!: I WILL NEVER EVER EVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN! RECIEVED MY GUN AND IT LITERALLY BROKE ON ME THE NEXT DAY. WAS TRYING TO TAKE THE BATTERY OUT AND IT JUST BROKE. IT WOULD NOT GO AUTOMATIC OR SEMI-AUTO, A BULLET WOULD GET STUCK AFTER EVERY SHOT. ALREADY LEFT A REVIEW FOR THIS THEY EMAILED ME SAYING THEY WOULD REFUND ME AND ASKED ME TO REMOVE MY COMMENT SO I DID, THEN THEY SAID THEY WILL ONLY REFUND ME IF I RETURN THE ITEM, THE ITEM HAS BEEN IN THE TRASH FOR DAYS.. THEY ARE LIARS! HORRIBLE AT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I URGE EVERYONE NOT TO BUY FROM THEM!!!!!!",0
"Another Option: I haven't bought this for my DS because of all the reviews saying how it gunks up the screens. Until Nintendo comes up with an official product you can try getting a package of screen protectors for a Palm or other handheld device and cutting it to size. It's a bit of a bother, but worth it to protect your investment.Fellowes makes a very good product that won't mess up your screens. I don't know if it will detract from the gaming experience - it hasn't bothered me while playing Urbz - but may be difficult for games that rely solely on the touchscreen feature of the DS. Happy gaming!",0
"Best thing yet: I am so pleased with this scooter. You can't beat the price, and 1,2,3 to assemble. My 6yr old has so much fun on it. Even my 2 yr tries to ride. My daughter is getting the hang of it of using her foot to push. The fact that is folds is such a plus. It takes up little to no room, very easy to store. I highly recommend this to all barbie lovers.",1
totally false advertisement...: Looking at it you would think that you were getting all 4 what they don't tell you is that you only get 1. This is false advertisement do not order!,0
"Who listens to this $%@#$??: Why the heck would anyone want to listen to music that sounds like it was generated by a soulless machine. There's so much music out there that sounds real and like it was made by real people. Ugh. I guess there are just some people that will buy what ever commercial corporate crap is thrown at them. Hey, ya' know you can get free and LEGAL live tunes at www.furthurnet.org ???",0
"downloading MP3 an overstatement: This toy was misleading.Not only can you not ""download"" it is not any kind of MP3 player.I bought it for my 4 yr old thinking I could download off of my computer or at least hear some silly kids songs. The music it offers is not very good. She played with it for 10 minutes.",0
"Good Resource but a bit Trendy: This reference book is a good example of very good logos for your average graphic designer. After not looking at it after a few years, it looks rather dated with ""computery"" techniques with a few strong exceptional logos. If you are interested in good logo reference books, consider the ""International Logos and Trademarks"" books by the Supon Design Group.",1
"Never pre-order on Amazon: Figure this one out. I ordered a copy for myself early in October.I then about 5 days ago ordered a copy to be sent to my brother. Now it says that my brothers copy (ordered later) is shipped, my copy is still to be shipped soon. And even though the local Meijerhas the game in stock, Amazon won't let me cancel my still to be shipped order. Refrickindiculous.",0
"nice exercise pants: ordered these for gym pants. Nice length. I am 5'5"" but have to buy things for someone who is 5'7"", because I have long legs, and these were perfect. The material is thin though, we shall see how long they last.",1
"Don't like it: I bought this smaller version of the grill on recommendation. I live alone now, and thought I might enjoy it. I am giving it to the person who recommended it.It cooks quickly, which I do like, and puts nice grill marks on meat, but I would rather stick something in the oven. At least, that puts flavor in. I cook a lot of chicken strips, and they are completely dried out when cooked in the grill. I tried a hamburger once, and that was a complete disaster. Might work if you put some filler in it.Cleanup is a real chore, even with the coating. It's just a big mess when you finish cooking.I had an original George Foreman many years ago, and that was a little better, but I finally gave it away.I will just shy away from anything named George Foreman from now on.",0
Small fit: I wear an XL helmet. XL Bandana was too small off a fit. Appears designed for a child. I wouldn't recommend product.,0
"nothing that cant be fixed: by first listen the band need time to develop. and that view hasnt changed. The arrangements are madly uneven and cluttered. Their far too hardcore influenced to be truely brute and too often the riffs fall into annoying off key notes. at times its brute and intense. for all its worht its got some decent breakdowns. at times its also confusing,mirroring Between the Bruied and Me one moment and then Norma Jean the next. Ill give them time though, since this is there first album, they have potential.",0
Disappointing!: I expected this book to have either more theory or more patterns or more of both. Someone who is already familiar with the concept of knitting in the round will probably not learn much from the book. Someone who is interested in learning may find the instructions to be somewhat vague. Someone who is looking for inspiration won't find much information. I own more than 100 needlework books and this is one of the few that I wouldn't feel compelled to keep.,0

"If'n ye wanta fie'outten wyz I don' liken thez book...: The whole Redwall series is written with over-done cultural dialects! The story could have been greatly improved if some editor had put his/her foot down and said, ""You're teaching everyone to write junk books! We need more good books in this world! I'm rewriting it in English!""If that had happened, I would have given Redwall a much better review.",0
