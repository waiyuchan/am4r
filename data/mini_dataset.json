    "reviewText": "This is the best novel I have read in 2 or 3 years.  It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop \"my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me\" trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are.\nAnyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature.\nI was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...\nI hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work.",

I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and \"truths\" within the story.\n\nIt's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read.",

    "reviewText": "This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\n\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\n\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\n\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\n\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\n\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family.",

    "reviewText": "What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism.\nThe story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it!",

    "reviewText": "I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the \"bildung?\"  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.\nI do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.\nIf you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend.",

One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn't but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\n\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).\n\nLam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and \"the delightful Senora Cool\" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia.",

Okay, so she's not a Creative Executive whose job it is to read and recommend screenplays for the studios to produce. No... she's just an assistant to the assistant of the powerful Iris Whitaker, President of Production.\n\nWhen first assistant Kylie Arthur sabotages Taylor at the first opportunity she almost gets fired. That's when Taylor realizes that Hollywood is just like high school. If you're not in, no one wants to be your friend.\n\nIn order for Taylor to survive in this environment she enlists the help of Iris' sixteen year old daughter Quinn. Irritated to no end Quinn nevertheless takes on the challenge and begins texting Taylor \"rules\" to get ahead in the cut throat world of the movie business and amazingly enough her tips are working! That is until Quinn's next rule is to steal Kylie's boyfriend. Torn between doing the right thing and securing her real dream job Taylor has some tough decisions to make.\n\nI LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book!! It was so much fun. Yes it did remind me a lot of The Devil Wears Prada but Taylor became a cherished character and I very much wanted her to succeed. I even loved the snarky Quinn. She was a spoiled brat but she had a good heart and I was rooting for her too. This is a fun breezy read that I recommend to all chick lit lovers.",

All the cliques and having to worry about trying to see if you could become popular makes me shudder to even think about it. That's why I could never even think of applying for a job like Taylor. It's sad to say that I probably wouldn't last very long. What I really liked about Taylor is that even though she works in Hollywood, and has the untimely job of being a second assistant, she's not ditzy. She's really quite smart and knows about the actual movie industry even though she's not too knowledgeable about the hierarchy about moving up.  I really liked learning about scripts and background knowledge myself.  It makes the movie industry become more real when you know this stuff and not just like some magical wonderland.  Taylor is also realistic and relatable. This book does not having annoying slang thrown around by characters and there's not really that much name or label dropping.\n\nIt's funny seeing her battle wits with Kylie with each trying to outdo and slam down the other. Although Quinn appears to be of help to Taylor, it's also a testament to the lack of parenting that goes on in the industry.  I'm really not a fan of how teens can do all these things, ruin people's lives and then get completely away with it. The only qualm is that this is a storyline that has been done numerous times. Almost every chick flick that takes place in a magazine setting has done this plot. Therefore you know exactly what's going to happen. However the story is so engaging and the plot is witty and funny that it really doesn't matter and you get sucked up into the the lives of the characters.\n\nIf you are looking for a great book to bring to the beach this is it. It's a fun read that totally helps you to escape from the normal routines of daily life and brings you to the glamorous world of the rich, famous, and beautiful. I wish this book was part of a series because I would love to learn more about Taylor's life and the world of Hollywood cliques. HIGHLY recommended.",

The reclusive director Michael Deming and his seminal work Journal Girl have been a particular inspiration for Taylor. Although she's never received a response, Taylor sends Deming updates on her Hollywood experience.\n\nTaylor soon finds that life as a second assistant involves small tasks and not the selection and producing of \"great films,\" at least to start. But more than the type of work, it's her co-workers that make Taylor miserable. It's like high school all over with the popular girls and their mean tricks. Taylor's too much of a nice girl to acclimatize. Outwitted one too many times by first assistant Kylie and with her job at risk, Taylor asks Quinn, her boss's popular teenage daughter, for tactical advice. It's not about being mean. It's about being confident. Not taking anyone's @#$%...Fake it till you make it...Speak up in class. When you're quiet, you're invisible...Make 1 cool friend...Lunch is a battleground...Enlist a faithful assistant. Taking Quinn's advice, Taylor wins victories against Kylie.\n\nAs Taylor starts to come into her own, a creative executive position opens up. Competing against Kylie and the other assistants for the promotion, Taylor proves willing to use darker methods to advance.\n\nReview:\n\nHollywood is Like High School With Money is the first Zoey Dean novel that I've read. Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully. It may be that I'm inured to violence and too sensitive to female bullying, but when I got to where Kylie was setting the first trap for Taylor, I found the tension unbearable. I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn't put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.\n\nOverall, Hollywood is Like High School With Money is a light, satisfying read. I highly recommend it as a fun escape.\n\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing (July 23, 2009), 288 pages.\n\nCourtesy of Hatchette Books Group.",

    "reviewText": "Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.\n\nNow on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.\n\n Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI's\n\nTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.\n\npros:\nLarge screen\nterrific images\noutstanding volume\n\ncons:\ninability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and vias\na somewhat outdated POI information.\nNon-truck specific routings.\nCost.",

    "reviewText": "This is a great truck GPS. I've tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.\n\nExcellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.\n\nI'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.\n\nMy complaints are relatively minor:\n\nBattery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.\n\nThe announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.\n\nThere is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot. Annoying.\n\nClean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rand-McNally-528881469-7-inch-Intelliroute-TND-700-Truck-GPS/dp/0528881469/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rand McNally 528881469 7-inch Intelliroute TND 700 Truck GPS</a>",

    "reviewText": "My brother is a trucker and pre-ordered this.  He was out on the road when it arrived, so he asked me to charge it, update it, and play with it.  FUN!  I am not a trucker, but from what I hear from my brother, the tools on this device are awesome.  It looks like it would be very helpful for him.  The thing is huge, a 7\" screen!  Overall, this seems to be a great tool.\n\nMy problem with it is that it cannot update.  I have a brand new computer running Windows 7 64 bit.  It's a Dell Studio XPS 8100 (i5 processor).  After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into \"connected\" mode when it's plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (\"Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)\").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.  I am hoping that it will update on my brother's XP laptop. we'll see when he gets back home.",

Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!",

This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.\n\nMy suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.\n\nWayne",

    "reviewText": "I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7\" GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7\".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \"Construction Ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.  Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy.",

    "reviewText": "Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.",

    "reviewText": "I highly recommend Elephant Run, by Roland Smith. Elephant Run is set during World War II in Burma, which is located in Southern Asia. The main character is 14-year-old Nick Freestone who lived in London, England. After Nick's parents' apartment was destroyed during the German bombing of London, Nick's mother and father both decided it would be safest to send Nick to Burma to stay with his dad on a plantation to get away from the bombing.\n\nAfter a few days in Burma, the Japanese forces attacked their plantation, taking Nick's father as a prisoner of war, leaving Nick to stay with the rest of the Burmese who were given the choir of building an aircraft hanger for the Japanese. Nick finds a way to escape with the help of a Burmese monk of high importance. The monk's niece joined them on their escape. Once they had left the plantation without being spotted, they hitched a ride on a couple of elephants and rode them over to the prison site where Nick's dad was being held.\n\nThanks to the help of a Japanese friend, Nick's dad was able to escape, too. While all four of them were escaping, two guards who were patrolling the prison gates spotted them. The elephant that had assisted Nick on his journey to the prison camp saw that the guards were wearing tiger pelts around their necks. The elephants, thinking that they were a threat because of the tiger pelts draped around their necks, charged the guards and killed them. Nick, his dad, and the monk's niece all were able to find refuge from the war in Australia.\n\nI thought that Elephant Run was a great book.  It was very suspenseful and it held my attention all the way through. I think that anyone would enjoy this book, especially people who are interested in learning about World War II.",

Secondly, in an ill-conceived effort at humor, the protagonist comes off like a self-righteous jerk--and a sexist one at that.  Third, there were so many spelling and grammatical errors in the kindle edition (\"accept\" instead of \"except\"--twice, by the way...) that I wanted to take a red pen and edit the book myself!

The original plug-in part made a sizzling sound one night and stopped working.  My husband tried to plug the USB end into one of about 20 USB to plug-in wall chargers that we have around the house and none of them worked.  We're assuming there must be some proprietary thing with the Nook USB end that won't let you use generic wall chargers which really sucked because he couldn't use his Nook for weeks.

    "reviewText": "I was very curious if it's really genuine or just pretending to be because it seems like almost every cable and charger sold in Amazon is labeled as being from the manufacturer.  Anyway, mine did not come in a B&N Nook box, it was in a tiny zip lock bag with a piece of ordinary paper obviously printed with a low-resolution inkjet printer that explains what Nook devices will work with it and what will not.\n\nFirst thing I did was to put it side-by-side with the original charger that came with my Nook 8.9 HD+.  It was exactly the same size, shape, color and weight.  The only difference was the printed details in the charger.  The print was brighter and crisper in the original, but it was also decent in the new one I purchased.  Also, the QR code in the original was missing in the new one.  Finally, the hinge mechanism in the folding prongs was a little different, but the \"feel\" of folding and unfolding the prong was exactly the same.  With the USB cable, there was virtually no difference whatsoever.\n\nSo, I finally plugged it in and the tablet immediately recognized it and charged.  I honestly do not see any other difference.  If it came in an original Nook box, I would definitely proclaim it to be original.  Maybe it was from a company that bought them in bulk (it definitely looked brand new) and resold it, or maybe it was from the same China factory who manufactured them for B&N and decided to sell units outside their agreement.  Who knows?",

It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.\n- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.\n- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.\n- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.\n\nWarning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.\n\nGave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV.

Also, these three books (especially the first two) were more erotica than romance, which I was not expecting.\n\nI feel like the focus was too much on sex and not enough on the characters and forging a romance. The sex scenes were very long and drawn out, and the characters spent very little time interacting with each other outside of the sex. I am not prudish - I like my romance novels to have sexy time in them - but this just felt like those porno movies that try to have a plot but really shouldn't bother because people only watch them for the sex. There wasn't a lot of plot or character depth here.\n\nAlso, I found Betts' vampires to be extremely boring. It's like True Blood vampires Disneyfied. Her vampires are out in the open publicly and drink synthetic blood called \"NuBlood\" (hmmmmm). Other than that, they don't act like vampires at all. I like my vampires to have a little bit of bloodlust, a little edge... Eric Northman is sexy, these vampires were just BLAH. I would have preferred them to not even BE vampires and the stories would probably have been much better.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend this book - her knitting romance trilogy was much better. This just fell flat for me.",

She meddles (in a good way) in the romantic lives of two other couples--the stories that make up the first two stories.  The first one is the lightest, the second one gets a little more serious as it involves the involuntary changing of a man with a terminal illness.  The third story is one for Angelina herself, and it is the most serious (in an obvious \"It's a Wonderful Life\" sort of way).\n\nThe background for the stories is that it is a given that vampires have been accepted as real, and overall are integrating into society.  There is very little blood lust/blood sucking going on (well, yes, from those Icky Criminals in the third story, but overall it's all very sanitary).\n\nThe author did a great job of setting the background in an unobtrusive way, and then just giving us the stories.  If the author was so inclined, she could easily expand into full length novels where we could learn the hows and whys of the world, but really she does a great job giving us just enough that she can stick to the shorter tales, and the shorter tales feel complete.  And naughty.  Did I mention naughty?  These are a little naughty.\n\nGreat little set of stories if these are what you are in the mood for.  Recommended!\n\nJTG",

The book impressed me, but I hadn't read anything else by Nichols, but this book made up for lost time. Nichols is a great storyteller.\n\nI'm a bit critical about the \"Christian\" message in books, mainly because it's often heavy-handed. Most of the \"conversions\" are contrived and the characters have to twist into some awkward positions in order to see Jesus. In this book, however, the theme of redemption is woven in each scene. Each character discovers God's redemptive power in their own way. Also, Nichols has a way with finding a scripture and creating a moving story around it. She beautifully illustrates the promise of Matthew 10:29.\n\nThe pacing was great, also. I only found myself skimming twice, mainly at the end of chapters because I was eager to know what happened next. Some parts of the plot seemed predictable when I began the book, like Samantha's life as troubled teen and Jonah's situation. Nichols, however, takes these time-honored roles and made them interesting enough to keep me turning the pages.\n\nMost of all, I think I enjoyed the book because it touches on the topic of ministerial burn-out. It is something that happens in church often but no one really seems to offer any solutions. The book, even thought it's a fictional account, shows a pretty realistic picture of how ministers get trapped in doing the Lord's work but not hearing from Him. I found myself going from rooting for Alistair to turn things around to being angry that he couldn't see how far he'd gone from what God intending.\n\nMore than once while reading this book, I had to force myself to stop reading in go to bed. Only a great book will make me do that.",

    "reviewText": "Mary Bridget Washburn is tired of living life as a druggie's woman. Her boyfriend spends all his time out in the back shop making \"candy\" and another man has been eyeing her. Mary knows its just a matter of time before this other man makes his move.\nBut neither man trusts Mary with money. Maybe they know if she has any she'll run away. They just give her enough to buy supplies to make meth and no more.\n\nFinally Mary knows the time as come. She hunts around the rusting trailer until she finds the stash of cash from the drug deals, and then runs away, stealing their pick up truck. She abandons the truck in town, and takes a bus to Alexandria, Virginia, where she takes on her mother's identity and finds sanctuary in the shadow of a decades-old church.\n\nBut then a little girl needs Mary's help, and Mary hopes to help them. Can her past stay hidden long enough for her to give the hope she longs to give?\n\nNOT A SPARROW FALLS was originally published back in 2002, and I'm fairly positive that I read it then, but if I did I didn't write a review. The book seems very familiar to me. Mary is a desperate woman, tired of living a life on the wrong side of the law, and yet knowing she is too far gone to return to her roots and the innocence she once knew.\n\nThe story is very well told, and not so dark as other stories I've read. There is an undercurrent of hope in this story, even in the darkness of the beginning, so you  know that somehow Mary will be able to dig herself out of the pit she's in. If you missed this story the first time, you won't want to skip it now. Pick up your copy of NOT A SPARROW FALLS for an uplifting story of hope.",

It is the type of book that reminds a person why they started reading Christian fiction books to begin with.  Linda Nichols touched on a variety of topics highly relevant in today's society including meth addiction, child abuse, and depression.\n\nHer story follows a young woman who flees her own personally bad situation and ends up in a small town where she shortly ends up employed as a nanny at a local parsonage where the pastor is not only the leader of a church but a high-profile Christian in many media outlets.  Everyone in this story needs help in some form or another, and even \"Christians\" are having trouble appreciating their faith anymore.  There is a lot to digest but the book is never without hope.\n\nI think you will love \"Bridie\" from the get go as I did and will spend the whole book hoping for the best for her.\n\nI received a review copy of this book from Bethany House to facilitate my review.",

    "reviewText": "Right now, I am standing and applauding Bethany House for finding such a jewel as Linda Nichols.\n\nI believe Linda's grandmother and my grandmother were best friends, for she has captured the sights, sounds and smells of my girlhood between the pages of this book regarding the grandmother character.\n\nThe reader is caught up into the sphere of spiritual warfare from the very first page, and then reads how it all plays out in the earthly realm. I know I have read the first few pages of this before and I'm thinking it was a contest that Dave Long held on conversion experience. It was so gripping then that I remember it to this day.\n\nThis story is very unique and, yet, it is the oldest story since time began because we all get caught in Satan's web of seduction, we all think there is no way out, we all bargain with God at one time or another, we all get angry at circumstances and must fight to forgive our loved one's choices, and we all find out sooner or later that only God can cure all ills, heal all wounds and change all hearts... if we just allow Him the elbow room to do it.\n\nThis story is very well-woven. The characters are first rate developed and we see personalities clash in a most believable way. What I love most about this story is that every character grows, blossoms, and finds sure footing on their life path.\n\nThe main character, Bridie Collins, is worn out from the bad choices she has made. One day, she's had enough of buying ingredients for cooking meth and being the maid for two slothful drug dealers, so she bides her time until they both crash from too much of a bad thing. She steals the drug money and makes her getaway, calling a hot tip line to make sure that Jonah is arrested and put safely away so he won't come after her. The drug money is stolen so her plans for getting far, far away go awry. She settles in Virginia. Bridie is not her real name, it is her mother's. Somehow, taking on the name of her mother settles her spirit and infuses her soul with a modicum of peace. She is still running away from her bad choices and not facing the music, but we realize that she has some spiritual growing to do before that can happen. It may be the middle of winter, when snow swirling around, but what a garden grows in the little family that is blessed with her.\n\nThere are a couple of things that distract somewhat, and keep this story from being 5+ stars. When the paths of Bridie and Jonah part, we follow Bridie and then we're jerked from that story into the jail cell of Jonah. It does not lend to the storyline at all knowing what Jonah is thinking. The tension is better built with the fear from Bridie rather than Jonah's intentions. Also, there isn't a thing added to the storyline by knowing what Jonah's attorney is thinking or that she finally winds up out of the public defender's office and in the prosecutor's office. Those were major distractions.\n\nIn my opinion, it doesn't matter how excellently a story is written if we are led down dead end paths which do not include the protagonist. In crafting a believable story, the writer should understand that the reader feels cheated and bewildered when we don't know where we're going, there isn't any light at the end of the tunnel, and we're in the company of a character we do not know.\n\nBut don't let that keep you from buying this book for your Keeper Shelf. It is an extremely good character study of a pastor who is man-called, not God-called and of a woman who is coming to terms, with God's help, with her bad choices and how God works in our lives for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. Excellent read. Time well spent.",

Caught up in a life of crime and drugs, she has abandoned her Christian roots, and is desperately seeking a way out. She runs away and tries to start a new life, but her past is only one step behind her. Meanwhile, the home of Rev. Alasdair MacPherson, a widower and father to Samantha and twin infants, is haunted by his wife's death...his life is in shambles and he knows no way to fix it. As this unlikely pair cross paths and discover the plans God has laid out for them, will Mary and Alasdair find peace in the Father, and healing through eachother?\n\nNot a Sparrow Falls is a beautifully written novel that is enthralling and a joy to read. This is a story of redemption and trusting God beyond reason. Forgiveness is heavily themed in this book, both from the Lord and yourself...God is not bound by circumstances. It shows how two very different people can be used to bring meaning to life and straighten eachother's spiritual paths. Author Linda Nichols slowly reveals the past of the characters throughout the book, weaving it all together and making you feel their struggles in life and why they are where they are. This makes for a novel that is hard to put down! I closed this book with a happy and satisfied sigh, and am eager to devour more of Nichols work. Not a Sparrow Falls is about new life and a fresh start...the perfect spring read!\n\n(I was given a copy of this book to review by Bethany House Publishers)",

Chapter twelve begins a most wonderful story that will touch your heart. The characters that seem so dry at the beginning come alive later and draw you in. It ends up being a very richly written book.\n\nThe book focuses on two people hiding from their past - Alasdair, a Presbyterian minister and prominent radio pastor who was recently widowed and left with three children, and Bridie - a fugitive from both the law and her past. A chance encounter with Alasdair's teenage daughter leads Bridie to accept a position as nanny in Alasdair's house.\n\nThis haunting story stayed with me several days after I read it.",

Not only was this story captivating, it left me with memorable characters and a story line that will resound with me for time to come.\nNOT A SPARROW FALLS is not a fast read. It requires a willingness to really delve into it, but once I entered the story world, I couldn't leave. The situations the heroine found herself in were heartbreaking and anxious. I loved the love story. It wasn't overt or edgy, but it was sweet and captivating. How I longed to see it resolved in the end. There were so many different threads that made up the tapestry of this story. From a family suffering from the loss of their mother, to a young woman running from a wealth of bad decisions, to a drug ravaged young man and the old woman who prays for them all.\nI would give this book five stars, but I am giving it four because there was a theology issue, I do not agree with, namely once save always saved.\nBut aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It resounded and connected with me. I will not soon forget these characters or their story.\nI want to thank Jim at Bethany House for my copy of this book to review.",

Screen shots of every action are shown, and important parts of each window are clearly designated.\n\nThis book covers only the Mac OS itself, including topics such as various settings and preferences, attaching devices, networking, and backing up, and use of a few of the built-in programs (mail, contacts, address book, itunes, ichat, etc.)  It does not cover any of the well-known third-party applications such as Photoshop, MS Office, etc.  The information is crystal-clear, thanks to carefully done page layout, and there is lots of good explanation and guidance.  Occasional red-box warnings of important gotchas are not overused, thus effective.\n\nThe Mac system has become so elaborate and capable over the years so that I'm not on top of many parts of the system as I used to be.  Thus, for many aspects of the system, it was good to see this book's first steps for how to use a feature, or turn a capability on or off, that I haven't yet dealt with myself.  However, content does not go beyond the first steps, so an experienced Mac user may want a different, more thorough, Mac OS book.  This book is ideal for new-to-the-Mac users.\n\nTwo useful things:  First, purchase of the book also offers online access to it for 45 days.  Secondly, there are two tables of contents, one the brief overview of chapter heads, the next with the detailed list of topics.\n\nThe one problem I had with the book is that, despite the thoroughness of the index, some of the topics that PC migrants might look for are missing.  For example, the index has no entry for \"screen saver\" settings, which I guess are covered under \"sleep mode\" and energy saving settings.  Hardly a fatal flaw.\n\nFor its intended audience, this book is easily worth 5 stars.  But if you're not a Mac beginner, parts of the book would be useful to you, though you probably would prefer a more detailed advanced Mac OS book.",

Frankly since Macs are so intuitive, such a book is probably not needed by anyone who has worked with any other Mac computers previously and is therefore only essential for those new to the Mac platform, i.e. former Windoze users.\n\nWhat I found most  useful was the manner in which each featured action was accompanied by a numbered illustration.  Basically when trying to use a new feature you only have to be able to read the numbered sentence and then find the corresponding number on the adjacent illustration.\n\nWhat I did not like is that many of the illustrations and their accompanying writing were so small that I needed to use my reading glasses in order to see them in full detail.  While this size issue was probably made necessary by the relatively small dimensions of the book itself, the publisher should have realized that many new MacBook users may be older persons.\n\nAs the parent of a teenager I know that younger Mac users, even first-time ones, cannot be bothered to take the time to read instructional books such as this one and thus I suspect that this book will be mainly used by the slightly older reader.  If I am correct, the publisher should have taken the size issue into account.  That it was not done is the only reason why I have dropped my rating of this otherwise serviceable book down to four stars.",

    "reviewText": "The title of this book and the editorial description are both lame.  This is not a book about using (just) your MacBook - but, rather, a Snow Leopard-specific introduction to using any Mac.  The only thing that is really MacBook specific - vs iMac or Mac Pro - is the brief illustration that shows what the various ports are.\n\nThis book is only for you if you have an Intel Mac running Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).\n\nNote, too, that every Mac comes with iLife, yet this book does not make mention of any of the iLife applications.\n\nWhile beautifully laid out and illustrated with screen captures, the editorial content of the book seems to have not been reviewed by a Mac expert, as there are numerous issues throughout that are either awkward, or not appropriate for a typical user.\n\nIn the first pages,  the author notes the use of context menus via clicking a right mouse button, but does not note that with certain Apple mice, the right button must be enabled in the System Preferences first.  He then talks about control-clicking (the way to get a secondary click with a single / left mouse button) on the trackpad - and does not mention the more convenient trackpad methods until much later in Chapter 8.\n\nHe notes that folders can be dragged to the dock, but does not point out that they can only be dragged to the right side of the dock only.  This is unfortunately typical of the almost-correct instructions throughout the book that a knowledgeable reviewer / editor might have helped smooth out.\n\nOn page 23, in a sidebar box called \"Remember your Gestures!\", Ray talks about four-finger swipe, etc., on the trackpad - but he does not introduce these until pages 213-214 in Chapter 8.  Even there, they are not adequately described.  Sort of hard to \"remember\" them on page 23 if you don't see it for another 200 pages.\n\nChapter 2 contains way too much information on extremely unusual network situations, breaking the flow of the whole book.  Most of the content of this chapter belongs in an Appendix in my opinion.  Much later, on page 150, Ray talks about sharing an internet connection in a way that most users would not understand ... or require.\n\nChapter 10 describes MobileMe backup before the more fundamental Time Machine backup.\n\nThe description of the keychain, which saves passwords, does not mention the importance of a secure login password to protect the (login) keychain.  Describing Address Book, Ray implies that a name can only be a member of one group, not describing dragging into multiple groups and opt-clicking on a name to see which groups it belongs to.  The description of displaying calendars in iCal is incorrect - suggesting that selecting a calendar displays its content, rather than checking the checkbox next to it.\n\nThe section on external monitors does not describe the designed-for-MacBook 24\" Apple display or how to operate with the laptop lid closed and with the external monitor as the only active monitor.\n\nThe Time Machine pages do not describe at all how to restore files - or how Time Machine can intelligently recognize certain applications, such as Mail, iCal or Address Book and restore individual mail messages, addresses, etc.\n\nSo, after not describing fully or correctly many of the basics of using Snow Leopard, Ray then goes into describing how to access the LaunchDaemon lists to delete services, something that most users should stay far away from.\n\nThe description of installing a new hard drive (to replace the existing one) is unrealistic unless the drive is dead - suggesting that one reinstall Snow Leopard from the original installation disks.  There is no mention of the more normal choices of (1) boot from the install disk and do a full restore from your Time Machine backup disk, or (2) attach the new disk via a USB or firewire cable and clone the old disk onto the new one before physical installation.\n\nThere is nothing in the book on how to burn data onto a CD or DVD via a Finder Burn Folder.  There is no mention of how to create a zip file (via the Compress command in the file context menu).\n\nIn summary, a lot of good content that is beautifully displayed, however there are also a lot of errors and omissions and inappropriate material.",

This is not so much about using a MacBook on any platform, but rather using a MacBook running Snow Leopard.\n\nRegardless of this, there were other limitations.  Overall this seemed to focus on accomplishing very basic tasks - common to all computers, Mac or PC - which Mac does so intuitively that I'm surprised this was the focus of the book.  I was looking for information on very specific Mac-things, such as Time Machine, how security works specifically on a Mac (i.e., no virus software), keyboard differences and shortcuts.  That sort of thing.  Mac has a lot of these, some of which are not immediately apparent to a former PC user, and I was frustrated by this lack.\n\nThis book would be best for someone with a new MacBook who is not that computer savvy on any platform.  For someone who is reasonably computer literate, this is much too simplistic, predominantly covering Snow Leopard topics that I feel most computer-literate people could readily figure out themselves...even if they've never had a Mac.\n\nI'm donating it.  :-(",

    "reviewText": "I teach Mac OS and have been looking for a \"recommended reading\" book for my intermediate Mountain Lion class. This is it.\n\nThere is little in this book so specific to laptops that I would hesitate to recommend it to a desk-top only student. It is really about the OS, and it does a beautiful job introducing the power of OSX 10.8. Almost every page of the book contains numerous full-color illustrations that hold the reader's hand while marching them through operations on the Mac. I am experienced in printing costs, and I wonder that a book so laden with color can be offered to the market at such a reasonable price. It also happens to be very well laid out. Clean and simple. You can read it in a crowded, noisy restaurant and follow the argument easily.\n\nThe review before mine notes that some of the illustrations are so small as to be difficult to read. This is a fair criticism, but is more than outweighed by the virtues of this very ambitious visual training manual. Considering what the author attempted, this book is a brilliant success. Yes, there are warts, but they are few and not consequential.\n\nIf you need a compendious OSX 10.8 resource, I would recommend David Pogue's \"Missing Manual.\" If you need to dip your head quickly and effectively into the features of Mountain Lion, I heartily recommend this book.\n\nBe warned, though, that this is not a beginner's book. It assumes basic familiarity with computing in general. And the author has perhaps erred in putting network configuration toward the beginning of the book, which is a challenging subject even to veterans. Don't let this mis-step deter you, however. This book is a great guide to Mac's latest OS, which is well worth studying in depth. I can't recall a book that takes a student farther or faster into a new operating system.",

Perhaps something less propriety would have have been nice. But all I saw in this book was more of the same. There are more pictures, which are of some help, but because \"My Mac Book\" sticks solely to the Snow Leopard operating system, you won't even get help with things like the Pages word processor. Since IPhoto is part of iLife, you don't get any help there either. Exactly what do you get help with anyway? Oh, iCal (which is largely intuitive), making files, working with Mail, using AirPort, and, get this, MobileMe--which is a paid, subscription service. Shilling for MobileMe should not be in a basics book like this, but there you are. It also goes into detail with Genius on iTunes. Genius is another of Apple's little features that is really nothing more than enticement to buy more music. So, here again the book is pandering again to Apple's sales dept.\n\nDid I learn anything from this book? I wish I had. Most of it is so basic that I knew the ins and outs already. For the stuff that really had me stumped, such as a keychain disaster, it couldn't help me with at all. I found a fix somewhere else.\n\nI suppose this book is better than nothing for rank beginners, but there are better ones out there. The official Apple books are definitely the better buy.",

The size of the book seems about right, covers are nice, and paper quality seems very good. The illustrations are clear and attractive although some of the screen shots are too small.\n\nOverall, I found \"My Macbook\" to be superior to many computer handbooks in readability, content and appearance. Of course, it won't tell you everything you might possible need to know but it gives a comprehensive foundation and you can also find answers to more advanced questions on the Web.",

I've been intrigued with Macs since my kids first got on them in their elementary schools.  I've always found them more user friendly and certainly sturdier for kid use than PCs. The only thing that stops me from taking the plunge and buying one is that the software I use for work is only for PCs.  (Since reading this book, I've discovered there are ways around that issue.)\n\nI admit I still have trouble with Mac's interface at times, and the trackpad just about all the time, but this book has helped me through my discomfort. (My two finger slide to scroll is evidently just not effective for some reason.) The layout of this book makes it easy to find what you're looking for without having to read page after page of a part or process' origins in the computer industry. I hate that about most computer books.\n\nMy conclusion:  Macs are different. And 'different' doesn't have to mean frustrating. Read the book and take the plunge.",

Of course, a how-to book is not necessarily designed to read from cover to cover and this one is well indexed and organized so that answers to questions can be found easily.\nIn addition to set-up and basic instructions, the book takes on some daunting subjects such as networking, sharing and wireless connectivity in a calm, non-intimidating way. In addition, a complete explanation of MobileMe and Airport Extreme are both very helpful.\nAll experience levels will get a lot of good information from the 325 page book. Highly recommended.",

The format of this book is non-threatening and friendly; if you can call a book that, in the way that it is not a big, boring book of foreign data.  The pages are designed with lots of color to keep your eyes interested.  So if you or someone you care about needs to unlock the power of the Macbook, the information is in here.\n\nThere are color screen shots of everything described in the book.  Sometimes when learning about the terminology, you will finally know what the initials stand for, like PPOE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet).  But it will not always set it up in a definition-like format, so you might have to pay close attention.  But that is probably just an exception.  There is no glossary of terminology, but there is a detailed index which should work the same for you.\n\nAdditionally, you will be able to learn a lot about your Macbook if you can get to the Apple Store and take one of their free intro to Mac classes offered at all stores.  I have taken it, and learned lots!",

For the newbie, however this book is exceptional! I wish this book had been out when I had first gotten my Mac. I feel that Snow Leopard (MAC OS) is intuitive enough, but sometimes just a little bit more information is needed and that is where this book might come in handy. It really covers just about everything in Snow Leopard from system settings and personalizing your Mac, using just about every application including Itunes, and basic troubleshooting.\n\nThe book is in full color, with labels on the pictures for the step by step instructions for each item it walks you through. It is very intuitive and easy to understand.\nI would say that this book would be helpful to both someone who used to use a Windows based system and transitioned to the Mac as well as someone new to computers and bought a new Mac. People already familiar with the Mac won't get too much out of this book though.\n\nI can't recommend this book enough to people who are new to either a Macbook, Macbook Pro or MacBook Air!

And where the book describes the \"four\" Chromebook models (correct at the time of publishing), there are now some newer models such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Chromebook-Wi-Fi-11-6-Inch/dp/B009LL9VDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Series-3-Chromebox/dp/B007Y8DJEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Series 3 Chromebox</a>. And where the book suggests that the Chrome file manager doesn't allow you to copy files from one location to another... well, now it does.

The black powder-coat paint matches the TV, and looks great. Adjustment and locking is easy with the included hex wrench. I would rate this \"5 stars\" if the mounting screws were better. Made from relatively soft steel, the screw head strips very easily. After ruining one screw, I replaced it with a large black deck screw. It might be advisable to drill small pilot holes before attempting to drive the screws.\n\nWord of caution: If you do not drive the proper mounting screws into the center of a wall stud, if you exceed the specified TV weight limit, or if you try to get by with a really cheap swing arm mount, you may be signing a death sentence for your $500 TV (and perhaps yourself)!",

    "reviewText": "I bought this mount for a 42 Vizio TV I inherited from my in-law to mount in my home office for computer and TV type use. I had a tight space between a desk and window to mount the TV so I wanted something that could move and this fit the bill. I was a little worried about the one stud mounting design but I made sure to find my stud properly in the wall with a stud finder and use a small nail to poke the wall to find the true edges of the board. Once I did that it was some measure to find where it would sit on the wall as far as TV height. Measure twice and drill once. I drilled the holes for the bracket on the wall starting with the top hole and using a level when marking the bottom hole. I put the lag bolt in the top hole first part way and then again used the level when putting the bottom bolt. Before tightening it down all the way I used the level one last time to get it level to my comfort level. Was done the bracket felt solid on the wall. I then mounted the bracket on the TV with fit perfect on the VESA mounts without using the extension arms that came in the kit. The kit was missing one bolt of the M8-15 bolts but luckily the M8-30 bolts fit into the bottom holes of my TV without being too long so I didn't have to contact Amazon about the missing bolt but was a little disappointed about that. Some quick screw driver work on the mount was on with the washers provided. I adjusted the tilt of the mount to face the TV down for my situation and realized I got it backwards once we lifted the TV but that was just an honest eyeball mistake. Some quick turns with the provided allen wrench to adjust the tilt and back on the wall it went. I tighten the one mounting bolt that holds it on and we are good to go. I adjusted the arm to where I wanted the TV and it felt was very solid. The articulating arms were a little stiff without the TV on their but once I put the 35lb TV on it moved fine, done want a loose swing mount. I didn't experience any sagging or off level issues. It is a two person job for heavy TVs to mount them but I did all the mount work on the wall and TV alone and only needed help with lifting the TV on to the wall when ready. Comes with an assortment of mounting bolts for the different TV holes, wrench, and allen wrench. You will need a drill and some drill bits for pilot holes. Good buy and would buy again.",

    "reviewText": "I originally bought this for a Sony 40\" TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42\" instead. I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs. I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it. (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.\n\nNow that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine. Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims. I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install. Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem. The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force. Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.\n\nI won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises. An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount. If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it). If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.",

But as for actually getting this thing set up, you are on your own.\n\nSubtract (1) Star for Incomplete Garbage/Parts:\n\nI purchased 2 of these to mount a monitor and tv (Both used as computer displays). If your tv or screen has the basic 100mm (4 holes) on the back, you will need to buy a handful of tiny washers from your local hardware store (I had to use 5 washers per screw  2 monitors, 8 holes, 40 washers). The screws that come with this are a half inch too long  you will not be able to secure your screen to the mount! While this is only another $6, it was a major inconvenience when setting this up late at night  I barely got to the store in time.\n\nAlso, some of the tools that come with this are just garbage. The little wrench they sent to adjust a few of the bolts bent upon first use. You are going to want to have your own tool set when setting this up. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SOCKET WRENCH! I cannot stress that enough!\n\nSide note: This is going to be much easier with 2 people. I was able to set it up on my own, but if you have the option have a buddy help.\n\nPros:\n- Once set up, these look great.\n- The quality seems pretty top notch (although Ive only had these up for about a day)\n- Everything is adjustable: You can set this up so that its very tight and doesnt move, or you can adjust it so that its fairly loose and swivels pretty easy (which is what I did)",

    "reviewText": "Of the many wall mount brackets I researched, this unit met my specific needs. I needed a unit that provided longer than normal extension arm length because some times the TV must face one direction, and other times at 90 to the wall surface. This mount provides perfect length to rotate the television.\n\nSurprisingly, the unit shows up assembled in its box and ready for a quick and easy installation. I did not need the extension arms, and these were not pre-installed for obvious reasons that fewer installations require them. Of the TV wall mounts I have installed in the past (quite a few for myself, friends, family, and neighbors), this one is by far the best and at a fraction of the price of other less-quality units.\n\nThe unit is sturdy and easy to adjust, holding up a 50\" 4K television in my home office.",

I didn't even attempt to use the bolts that came with this unit because of previous experience (with different products) having the bolt heads snap off halfway in the wall; go to the hardware store and spend $2 to get solid bolts...you won't be sorry when the heads don't snap off.",

We weren't timing it but it didn't take long. Actually, the hardest part of the installation was lifting the tv onto it. The directions are pretty straight forward, at least we didn't get confused. It comes out of the box almost completely put together and you actually have to take it partially take it apart to conduct the install.\n\nNOTE: the tv will swivel 15 degrees to each side. As in if you were to try to rotate the tv in 360 circle. We took the whole thing down thinking that we installed it crooked but the part that attaches to the back of the tv is meant to be adjusted for this and that is what we had to correct.",

Today, fortunately I found them with all necessary screws!!! Mannn! This thing is amazing. Within this price, they delivered a very sturdy, swivel mount with all necessary screws & washers! My 50\" TV needed a different & bigger screws and I found it in this wall mount's box!!! This is awesome, this THE best ever $30 I've invested. The mount holding my bigger 50\" TV without any problem! & I can adjust it easily. Once again, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this inexpensive yet amazing wall mount to any one.",

    "reviewText": "I originally bought this for a Sony 40\" TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42\" instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.\n\nNow that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.\n\nI won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.",

    "reviewText": "I really wanted to like this mount, but I'm somewhat disappointed.  I have installed many different types of mounts, so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent, but there are some items of which you should be aware:\n\n* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV (as I did for a 37\" LG), then be aware that the extension arms are \"maxed out\" at this size, which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.\n\n* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.\n\n* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.\n\n* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3\" to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.  If you're looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall, keep this in mind.",

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.\n\n1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?\n\n2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.\n\n3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)\n\n4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.\n\n5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32\" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already.",

Plus, the location was above the closet's sliding doors leaving only 17\" of vertical space on the wall. This mount allowed for such a tiny foot print with no problems. And it carried another solution of aligning the top of the mount and the top of TV because of the ceiling proximity. I could orient upper brackets horizontally and use a steeper angle for lower brackets. Because of a plethora of holes in the arm plate I could accommodate for any geometry. Amazingly, this kit comes with brackets-extenders if you need for weird TV form factors. The construction is very sturdy and there is no gaps in the joints. The TV can be turned and moved to any direction without skewing or loss of horizontal. Because of the extended arm it has another great potential by attaching your great old speakers to the back of the TV holding brackets. This might save you $500 - $1,000 on a Sound Bar.",

This is amazing. It is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use.  This makes the product unsafe.\n\n  I am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall.  I need to get a different one.  My prior experience was with a VideoSecu MW380B TV wall articulating mount, which is far superior for a larger TV.

    "reviewText": "We got this one recently and its a great wall mount. The unit is pretty heavy, so you will need a helper. It also includes a variety of screws to mount also. Our TV documentation stated it was a 400x400 pattern. But after putting hte plate over the back, seems we didn't need the extra extenders as its 200x200. This is on a Samsung 40\" 5000 series LEDTV.\n\nThe arm is hard to push and pull, but that is more due to being new and stiff. Make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten them.\n\nI initially was scared to mount it (what if it falls if I screw up!!!) but its pretty easy. Not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud, but i also used nails to get the actual edges (those basic studfinders are never \"exact\"). make sure you do the same.\n\nnot bad for $30-ish",

(Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)\n\nI will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.\n\nA tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.  You can usually find your compatible VESA patterns in your user's manual.  (Or a quick online search, perhaps.)  As I often say - when buying online, it pays to do your homework.",

After looking at mounts at Target and Best Buy that were $100+, would this possibly work?\n\nFast forward...  The mount took about 20 minutes to install (too longer to locate the studs than mount it).  The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully.  Very solid mount and good articulation.\n\nMy only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.  Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen (tilt) by about 1/4\" since there is only a screw on the bottom.\n\nOverall, I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20\" extension.

Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV.

Just make sure you find the middle of a wall stud for the lag bolts.\n\nIt easily managed a 47\" led lcd which weighs 35lbs, and it might take the extra 10-12 lbs of a 55\" led lcd if it's not pulled too far from the wall. Since it can swing out over 20\" I'd be carefull about going bigger than the 35lb 47\" tv that I mounted\n\nThe only thing which was dissappointing were the two plastic wire holders which are junk (very flimsy, one was broken in the package) and shouldn't be included when simple black wire ties work far better.",

I haven't tested the extension brackets, but the rest of the device is very solid.  I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.  Speaking of which, I've mounted two TVs on this, and the box included screws which fit both (in addition to many more).  However, you may need a few more washers.",

    "reviewText": "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!\n\nMom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).\n\nI knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?\n\nOption #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.\n\nOption #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.\n\nOption #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...\n\nThe mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.\n\nI hope this review is useful. :-)",

After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount!

In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.\nThis to me is a major product defect.

It mounts with a VESA 400 x 200 pattern, which is in the product description for this mount, but was not clear from the 3 options given in the documentation. To mount 400 x 200 you need to attach the extensions horizontally. For some reason this possibility isn't mentioned as one of the three options A, B, C which all have the extensions going out diagonally. The mount itself is 200 mm high, so you just need to extend it out to the sides. Another reviewer mistakenly thought it was not possible to mount a 400x200 TV (understandably given the documentation), so I wanted to leave this info here for anybody who needs it.\n\nMy basement room is wood paneled with 3/4\" knotty pine, but there was no stud close to the location I needed the TV. So I attached another 3/4\" wood mounting plate to the panelling with 6 construction screws, then attached the mount to that with the included lag bolts. The total thickness is now 1 1/2\" and feels very solid. I even was able to attach a Roku box to the mount with a couple of rubber bands which keeps it out of the way, but the IR remote still works.\n\nAs far as cons: the only one is that it's a bit stiff to move around. However, if like me you're just going to set it and leave it, that should be no big deal. All in all highly recommended for a solid, but inexpensive mount.",

With her help, we got everything done in about a half hour or so. The mount is excellent. It adjusts in every way, adjustments are easy to make and everything stays in place once adjusted. The great thing about this unit is that everything is included in the box--screws for the back of the TV, lag bolts to screw into a stud wall, even a small wrench to make the tilt and leveling adjustments. Very high quality product. Buyers should note that an electric drill, drill bit, Phillips screwdriver, and ideally a 1/2 inch rachet socket (a 1/2 inch box-end or open-end wrench would do) are needed, things that some households might not have in their toolbox.

You also need to have a stud finder).\n  - Well fabricated\n  - Mount does everything advertised (i.e. articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts)\n\nCon's: Really stretching here since this is a good deal: Instructions could use some help for the \"novice\" DIY'ers\n\nInstall tip:  It really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the TV mount\n\nInstalled a 15.5 lbs, 26 Inch Flat Panel LCD (VESA 200mm X 100mm) to this mount. Mount works beautifully! I originally had the TV sitting a little high on a stand, but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen (inherent problem with cheaper LCD's - not being directly in front of a LCD screen) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to \"tilt down\" the screen.

    "reviewText": "Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.\nNot so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.\nThree stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.

One for my computer monitor(24\") and one for a monitor I use as bot a TV and spare monitor(21\") for my laptop.\n\nThis is a stable, solid, very well constructed device. Highly adaptible to the many VESA as well as some non-standard mounting holes out there. I was worried that since I was using the VESA 100 holes the mounting plate might stick out to far, but even on the 21\" it doesnt stick out at all.\n\nThe instructions are very well written and provide good graphical representations. The arm is easy to mount to the wall, and to the monitor/T.V.. Compacts well to the wall when pushed all the way in, and extends easily when I want to move the Monitor out and around.\n\nVery stable, no vibrations, appears very solid, you won't be worried your monitor is going to fall off.\n\nThe only piece missing is the ability to adjust it up and down. You can adjust the Arm left, right, in and out, and so on, you can even adjust the tilt of the monitor, but if you need to be able to move the monitor up and down, this is not the arm for you.\n\nFor the money, you cannot beat the quality or functionality of this Articulating Arm.",

The ability to move her 26\" TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition.\n\nI subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum, about 2 feet away from the wall.\n\n1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted, the mount seems to sag, even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it. That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to \"fall\" in that direction on its hinges. SO it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves.\n\nOtherwise, it works I guess. But for $50 I'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about.

The only negative was to tilt it up or down you need to loosen 3 bolts and the supplied hex wrench too big to adjust one of the bolts so I actually had to purchase new wrench since I did not have any and adjustable wrench will not fit inside very small space for adjustment.

My hats off to the marketing folks with this manufacturer as they did their homework and included additional hardware and brackets to meet any possible configuration out there.  Including mounting tools and level were also an exceptional idea.  And tossing in a 7' HDMI cable was the icing on the cake.",

Although instructions call for finding a wall stud to mount, the hardware package includes large dry wall anchors and screws.  I opted to purchase \"Toggler\" high performance drywall anchors/toggle bolts.  These cost a couple bucks for a package of two at any big box store and they hold up to 240 lbs each.  There was no stud near where I needed to mount the bracket for the TV mount, so I used four toggler bolts, which was probably overkill.  The TV itself easily mounted to the wall bracket with hardware provided.  TV was on the wall and in use in less than 30 minutes.  Really like the 15 degree angle, which works great in a bedroom.  For the price you can't beat this mount.  Although I will probably never use the articulating arm, it is great for adding/moving cables from behind the TV by simply pulling it away from the wall.

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.\n\nPROS:\n-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need\n-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)\n-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!\n-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.\n\nCONS:\n-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my <30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.\n-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.\n-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.\n\nCONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the <$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.",

Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.\n\nThe arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.\n\nOverall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.",

I especially like the mount cover that hides the bolt heads.  Before I bought this item, I read most of the reviews here.  I thought I would address some of the negatives I read and have now experienced.  One review talked about how tight the mount was to move.  There is a simple answer to that...loosen the bolts on those joints!  Others mentioned how it was a two person job to mount.  While it might take two people to figure out where to mount it, I mounted this in an RV six feet high by myself.  Just take the bolts off of the bracket with the included wrench, mount it, then put the bracket back on.  I also read that the TV was hard to put on once the mount was on the wall.  There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don't travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.  It even includes a small loop to help with cable management.  For the money, I can't believe there is something out there better.  Make sure the bolt pattern fits your TV.",

The arm of the mount detaches so that it is easy to mount the wall plate to the stud. The mount was more than adequate for my light weight TV. It can be adjusted to swivel and tilt. The only negative was that while the plate mounted to the back of the TV with the screws provided, the lower left corner interfered with the power plug. Video Secure can provide a mount with a smaller plate. Rather than return my mount for the smaller plate, I chose to use a hacksaw and removed an approximately one by two inch corner in order to permit the plug to enter the TV. So with that caution in mind, I would recommend this product very highly. If I had ordered the smaller plate originally I would have rated it 5 Stars. I was able to do the job without any help. With a heavier TV, an extra pair of hands would be useful.",

    "reviewText": "Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.\n\nThough I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.\n\nI purchased it to mount a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LG-26LE5300-26-Inch-720p-60Hz-LED-LCD-HDTV/dp/B0039S7L1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTV</a>&nbsp;in our kitchen.\n\nThe mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.\n\nAlso, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.\n\nI decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.\n\nThe first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.\n\nThe first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.\n\nThe second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.\n\nI actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/VideoSecu-Swing-LCD-Wall-Mount-20-inch-Extension-55-lb-loading-capacity-for-LCD-TV-Monitor-Flat-Screen-VESA-75mm-100-mm-1US/dp/B000R0FG5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">VideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1US</a>&nbsp;gets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.\n\nI understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.",

I previously owed the 1950's DVD box set using the Bondi software as well, and this feels more refined and faster. I've been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.\n\nThe quality of the scans aren't great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. It's possible that was the best they had, since let's face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazine's run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said, on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. You'd think with all that space they'd scan these documents in a higher resolution, or at least offer some extras like separate folders with high-rez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960's DVD box set they immediately offered me a [...] off coupon for this set, which would indicate it isn't selling as well as they had hoped.\n\nWhich is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles, pictures, even advertisements are great to read. Sure I'd like higher quality scans, but I own both the Rolling Stone and National Geographic box sets and poor quality scans are an issue for all digitized magazines. So grab it while you can, because I have a feeling this won't be on the market for that long.",

Try looking for a dimly remembered story and returns may not be very good. I have no more problems using the Bondi reader than I have with the reader for the New Yorker or National Geographic and the search results are compatible. I have had the Playboy 50s through two PCs and the change from Windows to VISTA. Bondi supported their reader with a download that installed with no problems. The Playboy 60s had an updated version that installed over the old one without problems. Bondi has more than Playboy under their system. If that is your reason for not buying, you cannot buy any product like this.\nPlayboy is an American icon and a record of the good life for 60 years. The magazines are a trip down memory lane, the fiction is still great, the cartoons are still funny and the women are beautiful.",

    "reviewText": "This one is the real deal for the Nexus 5.  Works perfectly and picture quality is amazing.  It should work perfectly for your device as long as you have slimport (Nexus 4/5/6, LG G2/G3, Nexus 7 2013, others) and use a good quality HDMI 1.4 cable.  To my knowledge, Samsung phones DO NOT support slimport.  If your phone supports slimport, you are much better off buying this adapter compared to MHL adapters which require power input.\n\nI was looking to buy a HTPC or setup a small itx box for running XBMC/TVMC/Kodi on my non-smart Plasma TV, but realized I had a Nexus 5 with a broken screen that was still functional.  Instead of spending a lot of money on an HTPC box, I decided to try out this slimport adapter with my Nexus phone paired with the TVMC Kodi app to stream movies.  I'm happy to say I've found the perfect solution for my needs.\n\nI previously tried using a chromecast for mirroring my Nexus phone, but the input lag and reduction in quality didn't cut it.  Audio was a little off sync with chromecast also.  I haven't noticed any input lag, display problems or artifacts with this slimport adapter at all. Audio over hdmi works through the slimport adapter just fine.\n\nThere are many generic style and older slimport adapters for sale on amazon that are problematic, but after reading the reviews of this particular one and using it myself, I can vouch for it.\n\nOne little tip I'd like to add if you plan to use this slimport adapter with a smartphone for TVMC/Kodi is to download the Yatse remote app.  You can use your OTHER phone as a remote over wifi to control the device attached to the slimport adapter.  Perfect!",

I believe it is not getting a very good connection and will cut out. Then I have to go over to my phone and wiggle the wire until it comes back on. This gets it to work but I have to not move the wire while I set my phone back down or it'll cut out again. Sometimes it does it so much and I can not find the sweet spot that I just stop trying to watch anything. It could be great but mine just isn't working.

Connected phone to 55\" HDTV, turned phone sideways, and was watching high def streaming TV via phone apps in full HD resolution (e.g. no black bars on top/bottom).\n\nOne thing to note about the packaging.  On Amazon it says for LG G3, but when I received it the box does not explicitly state support for LG G3.  My assumption is LG uses the same connection setup as prior LG phones - thank goodness LG stayed with their standard connection port.",

One side goes into the LG G3 (mine is from T-Mobile) the other will connect to your HDMI Cable (in my case, I connected it to the Asus S1 travel projector) and you even have a plug on the side so you can charge it while it's working. It transfers audio and video in great quality.\n\nOnce connected, your monitor/projector/display will basically mimic exactly what you see on the phone. With NO lag. It's like working on a giant phone. I was especially happy to find out that if you use the built in Video playing app on the LG G3, it knows you have connected an external device when playing videos and will let you turn the screen off to save battery while playing a video. The projector is even smart enough to change the orientation based on how the phone is held.\n\nI got my phone connected to a couple of Philips ShoqBox bluetooth speakers and now it's officially MOVIE TIME!",

The proper way to use it is #1 you need your phone charger to plug it in the small port of the slim port to give it power to display it on your TV.  This does not mean it will charge your phone at the same time too.  On some phone it will charge your device (G4). Now #2 this one is important, you have to put your phone on airplane mode in order not to lose connection from your device to your TV.  If you don't do this video from your phone to the TV will be cutting in and out all the time or won't display it at all.  On some phones it might work without using airplane mode.  But I know that on mine (G4) it won't work unless I put it on airplane mode. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy your product!!.. I was pretty close to throwing mine away in frustration.

    "reviewText": "I own a few of these.  They are good solid microsd cards, and work in most devices, even ones that say they only support up to 32GB cards.\n\nSadly, one I bought ended up having an issue, where it was stuck in read only mode.  I could access and copy the data off it no problem, but could make no changes at all.  For example, no deleting of data (the files/directories would appear to be deleted, and then revert back), no new data (would disappear), and the drive could not be formatted (would error out).  Trying to run repair utilities on it would also fail.  The great thing about Sandisk, and why I use their cards almost exclusively, is that I was able to go online and fill out a warranty claim, and in less than 48 hours they sent me a postage paid mailing label to return the faulty card to them for a replacement.\n\nWhile the prices for sandisk microsd cards are often among the cheapest anyway, it's worth paying a bit more to buy from a company that stands by their products 100% and makes things so easy and quick for their customers who do happen to experience a rare problem.\n\nI'm a loyal sandisk customer, and Sandisk is loyal to their customers who trust them with their data storage needs.",
