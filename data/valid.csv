"GREAT! But really not the BEST...: Half-blood prince seems to be a book I have been expecting for a long time. It doesn't really break much new ground and follows the same introduction. J.K. seems to be trying to explain so much through talking and talking, which makes it really boring sometimes. There's not much of a surprise for the bad guys and actually no surprise at all. I could say I would find my 7 hours of this book not attractive at ALL if there had not been the ending. It really had an emotional impact, yet NO big surprises. NOT as perfect as the Prizoner of Azkaban or The Order of the Phoenix, but still a great experience for Harry Potter fans.",1
"good easy summer read: This book is so detailed in the small things that I really felt i was there. the cottages ,Vicars house. the gardens around each house even the trees were detailed. I loved meeting each person who lived in the boarding inn 'the helpers and the children.It is so refreshing to read a book that is clean no filthy language ,perverted sex and liberalism .I just enjoyed a good well written book and each one in the series was as equally as good as the first.I wish movies could be like this story actually it would make a great series like Little House On The Prairie---any producers listening?",1
"The Fantastic Deputy: Hocchuth's play is a piece of anti-Catholic fiction. The characters, the speeches, the accusations are fictious.In fact Pius XII protested repeatedly to the German authorities about the persecution of the Jews. He did more than protest. He personally hid thousands of Jewish refugees in Vatican City and at Castelgandolfo. He encouraged the convents and monasteries of Italy to hide thousands more. Vatican diplomats saved many Jews by providing passports, fake baptismal certificates, and safe conducts. It is indisputable that the energetic interventions of Pius XII in Hungary and Romania saved tens of thousands of Jewish lives. But in Hochhuth's play a fake Pius XII struts around the stage in a daze over stock options.If you want the facts, try Pierre Blet's splendid new book.",0
Great Book: Wonderful book I did not want to put it down. I thought that the characters and relationships were very believable. Easy read and a good story.,1
"What a fun time: This is a really fun video - the Sharpe genre is very entertaining and gives an intersting insight into a soldier's life during the Napoleonic era and beyond. This adventure, set in India at the time of the East India company, is like an old fashioned romp. The bad guys are really bad (lucious Toby Stephens!) and the good guys are great (salt of the earth Sean Bean). The main story is wonderfully set in a fortress in India; the scenery in majestic. The short about the making of the movie and the outtakes complement the movie wonderfully. Highly recommended for a cozy evening in front of the television!",1
"by far best series by the astonding L.J. Smith: L.J. Smith is the best author I have ever read and she certainly doesn't dissapoint her readers with this beautifuly done last book in a 4 book series. Tears of loss from the third book will turn to tears of joy in this perfect ending to an enchanting series. I laughed I cried I feel in love with this series. I recomend it to anyone who loves a dark story with romance, comedy and terror. Can't wait for Smith tocome out with another series.",1
"I'll say it: the best album in the history of hip-hop: The year was 1994 and Notorious BIG dropped his lyrical opus ""Ready To Die"", a masterpiece that contained party songs as well as street songs that actually made the masses of hip-hop heads think. This album is simply flawless in that every song is tight, there are no filler or subpar tracks. It's a shame that BIG was taken from us, because he represented all that was good about hip-hop!",1

"movie is not immortal: Let me start by saying the C.G.I. was great and the scenery they created was awesome, and the colors were outstanding. That being said the rest of the aspects of the movie were weak. The storyline was good, but presented poorly. The acting,except for Mickey Rourke as the evil king, was only passable. And come on!!!!!! Do we really need that much blood guts and gore to tell a story. I think Tarsem Singh did the movie a disservice by going over the top on the GORE. I would have rated the movie higher if the violence was left in with a lot less blood and guts.",0

"Wonderful Item: This waterpik is very good. It has a mechanism by which you can set how strong you want water to be pumped. It flosses your teeth well. It's easy to use. I bough it for my parents and they are not that good when it comes to dealing with electronic products since they are a bit old, but they are easily learnt how to use this since it is simple to use.",1
"A must have for every mom who shops!: What a wonderful product! I bought this floppy seat after seeing a mom using it with her daughter at a Toys-R-Us. I am so happy I did! My 7 month old son is sitting up now and I can safely place him in the seat of any size carriage and not worry about it! It is soft and cushy, and covers the entire seat (including the handle), and even has it's own safety belt. I really feel he is protected from germs because there is no way for him to lean over and suck on a yucky carriage handle. It also helps keep the toys he plays with from falling out of the carriage because it covers all the little openings they could fall through. Other mom's stop me all the time and ask me where I bought it. This is a must have for any mom (or dad) who shops!",1
loud and disk dependent: The disk spins making a loud sound and the software does not load to my harddrive. I am dissapointed in the product. Product code was not available on my disk so I used the posted registation number. It appears to me that there is little interest from the company in their product.,0
Good: I got the product in good time after I ordered it and the product was also matching its description. It said it was new and it new and in great condition. I would buy from this seller again.,1
"RETURNS WARNING>>>: Okay, i ordered this thinking it would fit my 14"" screen... it claims to fit 14, 16, 19 inch screens... well it was wayy too big, so i returned it. The returning process is ridiculous because you have to call customer service which the ""moody/mean"" people are never missing, then they have to ask all sorts of questions as to why you want to return it and junk and to top it off they take 15% off of your refund money for what they call ""re-stocking"" fee, plus you pay for the shipping return too. I think thats a rip off, so i dont recommend this company to do business with.",0
"You know what this is.: III isn't my personal favorite Star Trek, but obviously it is a must have for any Trek Fan. Finally they come out with the special editions. Dvd quality and extras are good but not great. Best there is though and certainly worth the price.",1
"Good Range: I purchased this item as extention speakers from an auditorium to other rooms for an overflow crowd. It was impractical to run a wire to the other room and the room was about 200ft from the auditorium mixing board. I plugged the transmitter in the mixing board and place in underneath the board. I placed the wireless speaker on top of a shelf in the room. It took a little testing and moving. Eventially, it worked well and it was loud and clear. I recommend this product.",1
"Objects May Have Class, But This Book Doesn't: I'll try to keep short. Pop's book is not worth buying if you want to learn Java. Why? Well let's look at the pros and cons of this bookPros-Easy to read (Text is decent sized, organization makes some sense)-You can learn from the book (Not much, but....)Cons-Talks down to you (If your using the book, you're probably in college and aren't not a child)-Animator (When will you use this out of class? Never!)-Hard to read (Organization can also be bad at times. For example, Pop sometimes cuts sections of text in half with a few pages of code)-Pop doesn't write code in a convenetional sense. He has his own 'unique' style. This seems to throw some people for a loop.-You don't learn that much from the bookSo would a recommend that someone should buy this book? No, there are better one's out there such as ""Beginning Java Objects: From Concepts to Code"".",0
"Poor reproduction.: Often the text is difficult or impossible to read. In some of the equations, entire variables are illegible. A different edition would probably be a better choice.",0
"Sleep Studio 3-Inch Visco2 foam mattress topper: This improved my sleep, i actually noticed less pain and restfulness after putting this on my bed. First i never got hot once on this bed so i guess the small holes in it work like they suppose to. The memory foam is memory foam not cheap knockoff foam like some other toppers out there, you can actually lay your hand or weight on it and it forms to you. Not too stiff and not too loose, I am over 300lbs and it sinks in but still has the consistency to not completely bottom out or make it hard to lay on. I do like to mention though that when this first comes out of plastic bag it has a slight odor ""most do"" but is not too strong and is somewhat pleasant green tea or ""mint"" smell. it eventually goes away, just lay out for a day or two and you should be ready to go, although it takes probably a week and its ALL gone. I would recommend this topper over others out there.",1
"Waay too expensive: I love this product and it's not easy to find. So I paid the price to get it online, then found it for $5.50 at Oliver's Market.",0
"The Ultimate Pirate Collection is a winner!: The Ultimate Pirate Collection is not only a great collection of exciting sea-faring adventure movies, it is a study of the evolution of movies as they transformed themselves from silent to sound. Movie buffs will be fasinated with the production techniques used to craft these old films. They also deal with very interesting social and political situations that are very intersting to history buffs. Being both a history buff and a movie buff myself, I could not be happier with this collection. It's the best $8.47 I have spent for a long time.",1
"Put your reading glasses on!: I bought this book as a gift for someone who's a big fan of Robert Kennedy. I have to say I was disappointed in the font size--extremely small print. Unfortunately, I don't even know if my friend will be able to read this book. I can't speak to the content because I, myself, have not read it.",0
"The Standard: This is the second TI-84 I've purchased for my kids. Each one had to have it for their math classes. It was the model we were told to get so it wasn't like I shopped around and picked this model for a specific set of features. Having said that, it's worked well and my other one has worked several years so far.",1
"Best CD of ""The Shamen"" and one of the best of it's genre.: Boss Drum is one of the best Techno-electronika-dance CD albums of the late 80's/early 90's. The title song ""Boss Drum"" has a beat that you almost can't help dancing too. ""L.S.I."" and ""Ebeneezer Goode"" are also outstanding dance music from the height of the Rave era. ""Fatman"" is probably the only track on the CD I don't care for, but the remainder are all music I like listening too. This CD is frequently in my CD player and I have over 850 CDs at the time I write this.",1
"Good tool for health & fitness: Ordered 28 of these pedometers for participants in our church's 12-week Health & Fitness Challenge. One of the participants has one and recommended this type. Everyone seems to like the pedometer except 2 did not work properly. Could be they were not set properly, however they seem easy to use and operate. Most everyone is amazed at how many steps they walk each day. A great tool to begin or maintain a healthy lifestyle!",1
"not that bad: tool is not that bad. it's ok for rough sharpening and that's what i do - sharpen paintscraper blades. it's quite convenient to sharpen them with see-thru wheel. i don't think ws3000 is good for very precice work, because the wheel is wobbling and in beginning it was chewing the frame.their customer service is very helpful. i had problem finding the right way to order new abrasives and i sent them e mail. answer came next day and solved my problem 100%.",1
"Mom...and Loving It!: I used this book for a bi-weekly mothers group, and it has been a big hit. The writers are down to earth, and realistic ladies who understand what it is like to be a christian mother in today's society. They bring scripture into every chapter, and have wonderful words of wisdom for moms with children of all ages. It can be used for large or small groups, studying 1 or 2 chapters each meeting. The words in this book, and the discussions that come from the topics, are extremely motivating to our group.",1
Great sounds: This is a real good CD. Very relaxing and feel like you are in the midst of a tropical island. This is a good buy,1
"Region 2 warning is wrong: Amazon's warning on this listing that it is Region 2 (i.e. won't play on most US players) is wrong! Like most opera DVDs, this one is Region 0, which means it plays in all regions, and NTSC - the North American video system.This is a wonderful disc, and I hate to think Amazon is inadvertantly scaring of buuyers with this bogus warning. Opera discs need all the sales thay can get!",1
"God this is the worst single of 2005: The Pussycat Dolls are one of the worst act I've ever heard. ""don't Cha"" has got to be the worst song of 2005. The lyrics do not make any sense. ""Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?"" These girls are not hot. they look like men in drag. ""Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?"" Nobody wants to freak these girls because they are too ugly. they look worse than I did 2 years ago When I used to weigh over 500 pounds (And that was not a pretty sight). ""Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?"" the pussycat dolls are too raw. Put some of them on a George Foreman Grill. Set it and forget it! These girls can not sing and have NO Business being in the music business. DESTROY THEM!",0
"Virgin Mobile is the BEST for prepaid cell phone service: Virgin Mobile is the best prepaid service provider. TracFone is just HORRIBLE (minutes go as high as $.50 a minute and text messages are $.30 each and I think you have to pay to receive text messages with TracFone. With Virgin Mobile, its $.25 a minutes for the first ten minutes of the day and $.10 a minute after that. Text messages are $.10 to send and free to receive. A lot of content is available at virginmobileusa.com for putting on your phone (ringtones, celebrity voicemail greetings, MTV and Comedy Central Content, and a lot more). You only have to play $20 every three month which is A LOT cheaper than most cell phone service providers. And best of all, NO CONTRACTS!!! Virgin Mobile is the way to go for prepaid phone service.",0
"Club class? More like cruise control...: Not a bad story, with the usual Ballardian ideas. But that is the problem: J.G. Ballard is getting lazy. Okay, so exposing the tedium, the superficiality, the pointlessness of bourgeouis life is the point of his writing (isn't it?)... but Ballard's books are getting more and more similar. This is just Vermillion Sands but less fantastic, Running Wild running on empty (and much less economical and experimental in form). All Ballard's characters, from The Drowned World to Cocaine Nights, are like millenial parodies of people out of a Noel Cowerd play - 'how frightfully dreadful, and pass me another cocktail, darling...'. Ballard is probably right ot say that unfortunately this homogenous, leisured, airport lounge, gated-communities culture is the future in a globalized, Americanized world, but surely there are different ways of approching it than to write the same thing, in the same way, over and over again?",0
"dont buy this version: Go buy an international version which is a lot cheaper than this, and they have the same contents. This version is also printed in Black and White and the paper is really cheap. Don't make a mistake like me buying same product for 90$ more. Again, the only difference between hardcover and softcover(international ver) is the price.",0
"Narcissistic garbage: The book is too technical for the man in the street, and not technical enough to qualify as a textbook, so it leaves me wondering why on earth it was written, unless it was to satisfy the author's narcissistic craving to see his words in print. Since it provides no definitive answers for anything -- because there aren't any -- there's no point in reading it.",0
"Nice game: Buy THIS PRODUCT!!!Very nice...fun...Two cities Sanfransico and London.Many vehicles... including double ducker bus,fire truck and army jeep..Army jeep is little difficult to unlock.Very nice 3d cities...clouds..",1
"Pathetic: Saucer is a waste of the paper it's printed on. The wooden dialogue is enough to not recommend the book, but that's just one of the (many) reasons. If you really feel you have to throw away several hours of your life reading this drivel, check it out at your local library so you're not actually wasting any money on it. Better yet, just pass on this one. It really is that bad.",0
"Great Work, Great Band, Can Someone Explain SCENESTERS?: I really like it. Great tracks include ""Dance Dance"" ""Nobdoy Put Baby In The Corner"" and ""Off All The Gin Joints In All The World"". Personally, I like TTTYG better, I am a big fan of high pitched singing, but Patrick has great vocals here too!Will someone explain to me the Scenester thing here? Who is it? What is wrong with it? I want to avoid it!!! Thanks[...]AND BUY THIS CD and GO TO WARPED TOUR",1
"The Best Of Italy - A Cookbook: One of the best Italian cookbooks we've found. The recipes are very ""downhome"" in nature and authentic representations of the cooking we encountered during our trip through Italy. Highly recommend this one. In fact, my wife just ordered another copy to keep in the galley on board our boat.",1
"Bad Translation; Poor Printing: William Arrowsmith is a very poor translator. He makes Hercules speak in hillbilly dialect, complete with misspelled words so we ""get it.""Also, the printing is terrible. None of the periods showed up in my version. That's right -- you can't see periods. Most of the other punctuation marks are smudged, and commas are missing their tail so they look like periods. Only a publisher of classics could get away with this kind of shoddy workmanship.",0
"Cute, my baby loves it, but terrible thermometer: I agree with the other reviewers, the ""HOT"" warning shows up even in tepid water temperatures. It's a great toy for my baby, she loves to play with the duck and chew on the bill while having her bath, but as a safety gauge, it's pretty worthless.",0
"science or comedy?: As an engineer currently working for NASA, and as a former Lockheed Martin engineer, I found parts of the book sadly laughable. Dan Brown should stick to writing about historical things instead of trying to be the next Tom Clancy. Even Clancy occassionally gets it right. The editors should be fired for gross stupidity as well.",0
"Pleasant way to wake up: This product has some great options for the price. The time projection is helpful for seeing the clock without having to roll over in bed, the buzz alarm is nice for mornings when I must be up and out of bed very early, and for all other mornings the sound machine alarm option is a much more pleasant way to start the day. The sound quality of the is not great, but that would be my only complaint.",1
"Out-loud Belly Laughs: I bought this book to read on a quiet day alone at the beach. After 15 pages, the other beachgoers must have thought me mad, for I was sitting by myself guffawing at Sedaris' wacky characters and situations. If you don't laugh out loud at the 7-page essay ""Cyclops,"" check your pulse: you may be dead.",1
"If you can't sound like them, sound like yourself: There are a more than a few FM tribute albums out there, and although I'm not much of a fan of them and don't like how the wanna-be's try to make money off of a band that is alive and rocking, I have to admit there are a few decent ""tributes"" on the market for FM. I came across a decent one tonight, and THIS IS NOT IT. The lead singer is flat, tries to imitate Stevie's and Christie's voice, but falls quite short (even on her face - did people encourage her a little too much in her singing? Sometimes when listening to these albums I note that although they aren't the real thing (who can ever be but the originals?), they could do well with their own works. Sorry to the singers on this, but if singing lessons are in the future and not insulting the real band by the ""tribute"", you could have a future. I just don't understand how this one passed inspection.",0
"Tulsa, OK: I do not usually take the time to write product reviews but I am writing this one in lieu of sending a letter to the manufacturer. I purchased a LitterMaid litter box approximately 6 years ago and was very pleased with the product. The motor eventually burned out so I purchased a second LitterMaid litter box approximately a year ago. Parts are now cheap and do not assemble properly. You cannot remove the litter receptable area to empty the soiled litter. You have to empty the entire unit. One of the guiders on the rake broke after 6 months. I gave up. Will never buy another one.",0
"Wish it weren't so: I had high hopes for this book - in particular trying to find a new series to read to my kids (ages 7 and 8). The problem is that the book is written in that self-indulgent, quirky style that a number of recent British authors (esp. of children's books - e.g. Pure Dead Magic) seem to find cute. Filled with non-sequitors and long asides that don't add much to the storyline, the book did not hold my kids' interest well. I suppose other readers might this writing style interesting, but I think it's a cheap gimmick that takes away from spinning a intriguing yarn that could capture a kid's imagination. What was particularly notable was the difference in the level of interest/attention my kids had for this book in comparison with the one we had finish prior: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl - a book that they really enjoyed.",0
Great Printer: This is a great printer. You can find many reviews about it all over the web. I just wanted to mention that the printer only comes with the standard 250 page tray and not with the optional 550 page tray. When I bought this I thought it came with the optional 550 page tray.You have been warned.,1
"Sharyl I Bancroft is a Fraud: Sharyl, you should be ashamed of yourself. These reviews are for consumer input only. It is obvious ""Sharyl"" is not some little old lady from Arizona. My guess is that Sheryl is a twenty something hired gun. Most likely some young man with a fine arts degree or a literature background. I say this because the review reads like pure fiction. Five stars?!? For a forty dolar plastic ruler?! Could you have toned down the rhetoric a little? Its really too bad. This is just one more aspect of our culture where one must sort through the crap to get to the truth.",0
wheres the memory card!: i enjoy playing the gamecube console but you gotta have a memory card and if its advertised with the system it should arrive with the system,0
"Works but very pricey: It goes without saying that it's often necessary to pay a lot for replacements for consumer items. Still, markup should be reasonable.",0
The thermophore arrived soon and well packaged. Good transaction.: I did receive the product as ordered and in good time. And the price was better than most. Great treatment.,1
"Net broke first use: I purchased 2 of these for my daughters. By the 3rd kick, the soccer balls had ripped through the nets provided and rendered these products useless. Guess they might be ok if you don't actually try to kick a ball with them. Total waste of money.",0
Repeat: I thought thatit would be different. If you have Knitter's magazine then you have a lot of these stories. I like reading her part in the magazine but it is a shame that I paid for the book when I already have the magazines.,0
Champion Plus Swiss Army Knife: I suppose the best thing I can say about this knife is that I find myself using it all of the time. I didn't realize at the time that Victorinox makes many other versions of this knife. Some have locking blades and some have less or more features. I use the saw blade a lot for trimming branches along hiking trails and to my surprise it has never bent out of shape from becoming wedged like all my other saw blades. It also cuts through very easily. I'm not a knife expert but this knife exceeded my expectations. It's a handy little knife to have around.,1
"White Bird: I will always remember this most about White Bird: when John Thomas just found White Bird.This book was awesome,exciting,terrible and sad. I think others should read this book because it was both good and sad at the same time!",1
Sprays my cabinet doors - Spray is too high - Awful Product: I truly hate this product. I've used the original Swiffer Wet and the Clorox mop. This one requires batteries - such a waste when it could be a pump. The spray goes out about 3 feet and I had to wipe down my kitchen cabinets and my wooden table legs afterwards. The scrubber is difficult to flip over to use. The pads come dry so you have to use the sprayer to wet them down. It uses a lot of the solution. Since you can't refill the container with your own cleaning product they have you sucked into buying bottles of their solution. I'm throwing mine in the trash and going back to the Clorox model.,0
"A Must-Have for Bills fans: All I can say is that I am one proud Bills fan after watching this DVD! I would recommend it for anyone who calls themself a fan...It's certainly not easy to capture a team's 50 year history in only 1 hr and 45 minutes but this release is solid. You'll learn not just about the team, but which players & coaches were most beloved by Bills fans and the city of Buffalo. I've only had the chance to watch the main documentary so far, but that alone is worth buying this DVD for!",1
"I feel I was suckered!: I went to see the movie and it really intrigued me. As many others I was led to believe that although the movie was fake, the story was true. I ordered the book that evening. I again was very intrigued and finished it a few hour after receiving it in the mail. I was talking to a friend about the movie and the book, and she pointed out the disclaimer that I easily overlooked. It is ALL fiction. The story is very scary, but most of the fear is from thinking the story is true.",0
"Less than one star: Many years ago, when I struggled in the throes of alcoholism I would have clasped this book to my bosom like a drowning person clasps a life saver. These type of books are very misleading, they encourage seeking after ""cheap grace"" and they totally ignore the Christian message of love and service toward others. This is a very bad, fast-food type religious book based on very shaky scholarship and is an example of what Fundamentalists like so much to do -- proof texting -- using one example to bolster an argument even if that example goes against the tenor of the whole work. Not worth the money or the time to read it.",0
"Excellent Read.: This was a well-researched and empathetic book, told in a very matter of fact manner that really painted the picture of what the Dust Bowl dwellers experienced. The unexpected surprise was the history lesson concerning the lands history and the Government's role in it's development.I was most surprised that of all the bits and pieces I'd heard about the Dust Bowl, I'd never clearly heard much about the cause of it before so that was enlightening. I understand it may be touchy to even suggest Humanity may be responsible for it's own trials sometimes but it was what it was and Timothy told it well.I'm glad a learning experience came out of it for not only those who had to suffer through this but for those of us who get to read it about it as well! This book left me with admiration for the survivors and a new respect for the Middle belt of America.",1
"A treasured keeper: I've been reading romance all my life, but never can I remember reading a book that touched me as much as this one. Draven is a great hero and Emily is the perfect match for him. Kinley MacGregor has a new fan.",1
"outdated bore: Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of creepy black and white horror movies, but this 'horror' anthology looses its appeal at the very beginning. I usually don't think movie remakes are a good idea, but using the outline of this movie (dummy that comes to life, living out a dream) in a more modern day setting would probably be pretty good. Dead of Night attempts to be atmospheric and ends up just being..dead..",0
"Far from humorless, this twisted comedy is da bomb: Far from the humorless exercise in torture you may have been led to expect, this movie is a tour-de-force of rapier wit and twisted hysteria. A potent cross between comedy and psychological horror with a twist of sarcasm thrown in for good measure, this movie is a monument to the comic genius that was the Akroyd & Belushi team. No serious comedy collection is complete without this masterpiece.",1
"SHOULD HAVE BURIED THIS ONE!: It pains me to give a Blackfoot release a bad review but trust me ,there was no other option on this one.Blackfoot was without a doubt one of the greatest live acts I've ever seen but this recording does them no justice.The fire that Medlocke and Co.always brought to the stage is without a doubt missing here.If it's live Blackfoot at their best you're looking for,then look no further than their first live release 'Highway Song'and you won't be disappointed.",0
"Dumb: Just Dumb. I""m waiting for the HiRez Blu-Rays to be release after Lucas's inevitable death. Surely at that point someone sensible will take control of the helm.",0
"Good film, great extras: The breezy rehab story of Gwen Cummings(Sandra Bullock) and her 28 days towards the road to recovery isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definitely enjoyable.The key points to the DVD that may warrant you buying it are Betty Thomas's directors commentary, three character testimonials that were cut from the final film, instructions on how to make a gum wrapper chain like the fiesty heroine,theatrical trailers,and talent files. But the best thing, and possibly worth the price of the rest of the disc, is the hilarious 26 minutes of ""lost episodes"" of the fictional soap ""Santa Cruz"" that everyone at the rehab center watches.That alone is almost as funny as the movie, with the actors playing their scenes with intense seriousness amid ridiculous plot situations even more far fetched than the average soap.",1
"Motor City Madman Kills Again!: ted is playing better than ever...with a stripped down 3 piece band, he is rocking at his very best, with better than ever riffing, licks, leads, and TONE! Nuge fan's get this one!",1
"totally bizarre and hilarious double feature: It's Alive is one of the best Z-grade movies I have seen in a long time, and I got some gut busting laughs at its expense. It is slow moving and features really bad quality filming, but the creepy main actor, absurd editing and preposterous situations (especially the prisoner/maid who is ""tortured"" with a dead mouse and a whistle) were so hilarious that I could not take my eyes away. For anyone who enjoys bad horror/scifi, highly recommended. For anyone who will take it seriously, perhaps take a pass. The War of the Robots was incredibly boring, I am not sure how I made it through and yet I did. The real gem in this collection is It's Alive.",1
"no, no, no: These eye pads are super saturated. I thought it would add something extra (as far as pampering) to 'face-mask night'. The watery stuff gets in your eyes. So, I rang it out, figuring less product might get better results. After a few minutes the skin around my eyes became very irritated. Itchy, burny, dry, yuck. You want something to cover your eyes with? Slice up a cool cucumber.",0
midsommer murders set 13: I found the quality of the DVD excellent and I enjoyed these stories in the series. I would recommend iit to those who like British mysteriees-not violent but a riddle to be solved.,1
"Overrated: I'm not sure what the big deal is with this stuff. I tried it on my 2 1/2 yr old 10 inch omelet pan and I must say am underwhelmed. Despite several applications and lots of scrubbing, this $15 jar of cleaner was no better than my 89 cent can of Bon Ami, and maybe not as good. I'll probably use it up only because it cost so much, but I won't be ordering it again.",0
Photoshop elements 4 classroom in a book: Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 Classroom in a BookThis book is designed around a CD that was not included. If I had known that I would not have purchased this item.,0
"Not as good as ""One last Time"" or ""What if god were sun"": I'm a John Edward fan, but didn't enjoy this book. In fact, I couldn't finish it. I loved ""ONE LAST TIME"" and ""WHAT IF GOD WERE THE SUN"". This book is difficult to follow because too many names are introduced, too much technical lingo. You need to take notes just to keep it all straight. I understand it's an auto-biography and in life, several people cross your path, but this was just too much. I think he could have simplified his story and left the names on the acknowledgment page. Sorry, John...didn't like this one.",0
"Cute and bright!: Super Pocoyo is a collection of small Pocoyo episodes which are great for kids with small attention spans or just as something quick to watch. In Pocoyo there is a narrator that talks but other than that the characters only make a few sounds/words every now and then. It is a cute and simple show great for preschoolers. My 2 year old actually cracked up when watching this DVD and then I laughed because I couldn't figure out what he was laughing at! The animation is bright, colorful and full of fun shapes but as far as a plot goes there really isn't one. The show just has Pocoyo and his friends doing simple tasks and small adventures. It is not really meant to be educational but rather ""learning through laughter"" and showing friendship.",1
"wonderful book: We enjoy this book, the whole family. I saw it first in a children's corner in a museum in Santa Fe, and loved it from first sight. Had trouble buying it... only used copies are available. It's wonderful! Pictures are amazing (especially if you love cats). They are all alive. The story is sort of gloomy, but very fascinating. I love the book!",1
"From the May issue of IRS.theroadlesstraveled.org: This one is so marginally tolerable you could ALMOST give in - wait for it to show up on cable, blundered upon by channel surfing, and stand it for whatever length you deem worthy. It will seem fun then. Rent it, and your pizza arrives lukewarm. The good news: the computer animated crocodile is very cool.",0
"Terrible Waste of Money: I have 3 small children, so I constantly have spills and spots on the carpet. So I thought this would be a good investment to remove spots as they happen. Boy was I wrong. It doesn't get out the spots. It leaves the carpet REALLY WET. As for it being easy to use and lightweight it isn't. It is more of a hassle to use than it is a convenience. It's bulky and to try to get a spot out is impossible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Don't waste your money.",0
"Wow - What a great DVD: This is a great DVD that has singing, instruments and will make you laugh at times time and cry at other times. The director did a great job and the ladies sing with beauty and grace. It is great to watch and or just listen to.",1
"complete waste of money: I am incredibly disappointed in this. IMHO, it is a complete waste of money. It is very difficult to use. The pliers are always in the way and have to be manipulated before you can use ANYTHING. The ""ruler"" is useless. There are no scissors. I own a Gerber Suspension which is light years ahead of this piece of junk.",0

"Dreamin' in the 50's!: Subtitled ""The Secret Nudes of Denny Denfield"" this is another book of male nudes brought to us by David Chapman (""Hollywood Nudes"", ""Adonis"", & ""Mountain Men"") who has been an inspiration in giving us a history of gay male nude photographers. This photographer was not known at all compared to most of the rest. I thought this book was an excellent display of his male nudes. There are about 63 pages of nudes here, not a big book, but a good representation of his work. These are photos of men from that era in clear black & white set in outdoor surroundings. It's surprising how muscular these men were for that time period.Denny loved photos of nude men, which were hard to purchase in the repressive 50's. So he spend many hours taking his own on the beach of the many attractive men he met. These are very posed pictures but the men are none the less erotic. I enjoyed learning about this photographer and seeing his photos for the first time in this book.",1
"Great - Happy to Have!: I think the mini co-sleeper is great! Perfect height, lots of storage space underneath to put extra diapers, blankets, toys, whatever in...the only thing that take's some getting used to are the catches to lower/raise the 'bed' side of the sleeper. They were hard to move up/down when I moved it to the living room and back (which was way easier than a regular pack-n-play, since the mini has wheels on one side!) Overall, I think it's a great product :)",1
Excellent: Good musical. Very powerful and it really touched my heart when I heard it so i suggest it too others,1
"A good read!: There isn't much mystery to the plot, nor it explicitly explained why Ruth changed her burial decision. However, it's packed with Chinese culture, details of what life was like in China, the political movements, etc.. I recommend this book strongly to any one who would like to learn more of the Chinese culture/history, specially to the ABCs (America born Chinese).",1

"It's what I was looking for: I have 3 little dogs and a very small backyard. Need I say more? The size of this septic-tank seems to be perfect for the number of dogs I have. It took me about an hour to dig the hole (using a post hole digger). So far I have no complaints about the system. I installed it about 2 months ago and it's working perfectly. The top of the tank is plastic. I read one reviewer's comment that said the top had cracked after some time. Mine seems to be holding up well so far. Once I've used it for a while, I'll add more to my review.",1

"wait for cable.....: Aside from a few attractive ""actors/actresses"" -- and I use these terms lightly, this film has little to offer. The acting was terrible, the plot was okay, but needed alot of work!!! There were holes in it.This is a cheap ripoff of ""Wild things"". They even went so far as to have a Denise Richards ripoff who was trying to hard to be Jason Vorhees.Don't waste your money, at least wait for it on HBO if you really are curious about it.",0
"love jazz: If you love smooth jazz, you will love this cd. It's great for driving down the road with the top down.",1
"Tank Problems: I too had trouble with the tank leaking. My hands are small, making it very difficult to screw the top onto the tank tightly enough, so I learned to make sure it was on good, and made cappuccino successfully twice. Well, this morning I made very sure it was on tight. Perhaps I put too much coffee in it?? I did not tamp it down, though. Turned on the stove and waited. All that happened was that the milk boiled - no coffee. I finally poured the milk out and hoped the coffee would come up. It never did. Then I had a time removing the button mechanism - finally got it off, but I cannot get the tank top unscrewed!! I may have to send it back with a note that the tank contains coffee and water! Very disappointed!",0
"3 Cups???: This coffee press does what it is supposed to do, for the most part. You can make coffee with it, but I have concerns about the measuring device(s) used to get 3 Cups. When I opened the package, I couldn't imagine three cups of coffee came from such a tiny press. So, I measured the pour and only 1 cup of coffee came out (1 US cup = 236.588237 milliliters). Since it is a ""one cup at a time"" press, do I only get three full cups and then have to throw it away and order another? The instructions do not tell you how to obtain three cups of coffee from this press. The instructions outside say use 3 scoops of coffee grounds. The instructions inside say to use 1 scoop (per cup). I measured only one cup, but the box says 3 cups. Do I use old grounds to get my next two cups? Ew... So, how did the manufacturer get three cups?? I was expecting a press that made three cups of coffee in one brew.",0
"Great shampoo: This is a great shampoo. I was looking for a sulfate and sodium chloride free shampoo after a brazilian blowout, and came upon this one after reading reviews. Its very cleansing (unlike many others that don't have these ingredients) while not being too harsh. Main drawback is the price, and a very mild subtle fragrance.",1

"My view of ""Hell On Wheels"".: This is a very compelling adventure of when the transcontinental railway was being built. The adventure has compelling characters and the story is very well written. I have enjoyed owning and watching the first season again. Owning it makes one able to solidify the continuity of the story.(As opposed to watching an episode per week). I would recommend this series to anyone interested in it. Len",1
"Gets into important subject areas.: For the most part this book is what one might expect from the title: it covers a lot of ground quickly, and is fairly interesting and fun. What raises the book a notch in my opinion, is that Shenkman sometimes gets into important subject areas. For example, there is a fascinating section on myths of Nazi war preparedness and wartime production. I had read Albert Speer's somewhat self-serving book years ago, and the material Shenkman provides helps put in better prospective the apparent lack of impact of allied bombing on Nazi armament production. There is a chapter on the American family which is jumpy and incomplete, but at least it whets the appetite for a book on this subject, as well as providing some fascinating facts.",1
"EW EW EW EW: This cd reminds me of ashanti, being a mix of annoyingness and a bad voice. Tamia sounds like a cat wailing in the night. If i wanted to hear this cd i would have stayed up at night and listened to my neighbours cat wailing at the moon. Tamia, do youself and society a favour and stop singing.",0
"Great Technical Writing But No Scares: Levitating and Psychic zombies are the least of this book's problems. Forget the ridiculous premise of phone signals downloading instructions to the masses or the fact that a major plot point was written a number of years ago by author Brian Keene (going after a missing son in THE RISING), let's get down to brass tacks here -- it wasn't scary in the least!King falls back on his usual formula of gathering survivors together to battle the big baddie and then, of course, prevail so conveniently and in such a preposterous and illogical outcome, you have to ask yourself, ""Why is this a bestseller?"". Having the name Stephen King still sells books, but at some point, people will realize that the master of horror is now past his prime. Mr. King needs to go back and read his early work from the 1980's to remind him of why he was so great in the field of horror, and ultimately, how to scare the audience.",0
"Don't Waste Your Money!!: I think that Derringer wrote the previous reviews ... 5 stars for what? Muddled guitar, so-so vocals, and bad songwriting? All three of these guys have some great music in their past, but sorry boys, the party's over.",0
Horrible!!: I bought these bottles for my newborn and initially found the vent system to be working but after 2 weeks all the vent systems on the 6 bottles we had stopped working simultaneously and the nipples were collapsing. I had to keep pulling the bottle away from my hungry baby to allow air in bottle. These suck. Don't waste your money when other companies offer the same BPA free products for a fraction of the price. I returned these to Babies R' Us for a credit and bought Playtex Drop-In system bottles (liners are BPA free) and they have been great. Gas my baby had been experiencing also seemed to decrease after switching as he is not sucking as hard.,0
"Popularity does not imply quality, people...: Even when this game first came out, it was fairly mediocre. Let's move on, shall we? There are many, many games that topple Half Life and Counter Strike released since 1998.Contrary to what the Amazon editorial had to say about this game, Half Life is not the bloodiest (Soldier of Fortune), is not the smartest (No One Lives Forever), and is not the scariest (System Shock 2 or Clive Barker's Undying).Half Life is a hypefest.",0
"Not even ONE star!: CHEESE! Absolute CHEESE! I wouldn't give this ONE star, but there was no option for zero stars. This has to be THE CHEESIEST production ever made. Granted, she's no fitness guru, but come on! If you're absolutely clueless as to the art of striptease, it's a good introduction. But, it's NO workout and is so basic that it's almost insulting to those who can actually do a lap dance. Oh well, you live and learn. Anyone wanna buy mine? I have the 2nd video too. :(",0

"Worth the Wait: As an older listener, much of this CD was not to my taste. I really need to give it another go round to realize more positives. It took me forever to realize that the best cut from Nu Day was ""Tell Me Who""; it just hit me one day. I had been drawn to that CD by the wonderful single ""Stranger in My House"". The early cuts on the current CD remind me very much of other R&B singers in Tamia's age range. It was a bit of a turn-off. There were no songs to match ""Tell Me Who"" or ""Stranger"". However, the duet between Tamia & Levert knocked my socks off. Were they ever in synch! Then, when I reached ""Tomorrow"", I realized that my money was well spent. It made the wait very much worthwhile. Just listen to this young woman's voice! A phenomenal talent.",1
"Warning: The music on this CD is great. My comments have to do with the way in which Amazon describes the product. This is a CDR, without any liner notes and the track listing basically copied from the web site. But you will not learn this by looking at the Product Details. You will find this information under Editorial Reviews, where it says: This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.While this information would have been better placed under Product Details no where does it tell you that you will not receive the liner notes.Amazon is misrepresenting the product. I hope my short review will help others who are considering purchasing the CD.",0
"cheesy: Susan Jeffers, Ph.D is a fine writer and her book ""Feel the ""Fear but Do it Anyway"" is really a must have. unfortunately, perhaps due to the time produced, this set of affirmations comes across as incredibly silly because Dr. jeffers is not equally gifted with a soothing voice. it is nasal, with ups and downs of inflection that are more like a narration of a bad children's book. And the music....egad, even if it were well produced it is nauseatingly tinkly and grating.Some pieces of this are ok, and if done by someone with a better voice, with better music, it would not come across sounding to fatuous as it does. It might make a 10 year old feel confident, but not for long....",0
"Not worth the money: I was very dissaponted when I toasted my fisrt slice of bread. One side is toasted and the other side is burnt.

"Buyer beware--NOT PLUS SIZE: These underwear are not what I ordered. Nowhere on the package does it say ""Plus size"" or Grande or whatever designation Jockey is using these days to designate underwear sized for curvier derrieres.

You may not get what you think you ordered.",0
"Possibly the Most Overrated Film in American History: That the AFI put this miserable roll of film in the top 100 says more about the AFI than anything. This movie is quite possibly the worst movie that's ever been made outside of Ed Wood. NOTHING in this movie deserves merit. The mean-spirited scenes involving people of North Dakota and the subtle attacks on Asian-Americans is quite evident. I truly wish the Coens would realize one thing: It's great to have relatives in the business, but that does not make one an artist or a filmmaker.",0
"By All Means Skip This Product and Buy the SanDisk Sansa: I owned this exact product for 7 months before it died unexpectedly. It replaced a Rio that I owned for 6 years and used for 30-60 minutes every day running or lifting weights. The Lyra's battery consumption was horrible compared to the Rio, and even worse to my new 1 Gb Sansa. I'm still on my first battery with the Sansa, and it has played what would have been 3 batteries worth of MP-3's on the Lyra.The user interface and features on the Lyra don't compared to either the 2000 Rio or the 2006 Sansa. Sadly, Rio exited the business, but the SanDisk product is at least as good. Plus, for the same price I paid 7 months ago for the 512 Mb Lyra, I got a 1 Gb Sansa.It is sad to see the vaunted RCA name on such an inferior, poorly designed, and undependable product.",0

"dissapointed: I got this book as a ""joint"" present for my wife and myself expecting it assist us in adding ""life"" and ""spark"" to our sexlife. We have both been fairly dissapointed, though. You are supposed to tear out one page per week and do that for your spouse sometime during that week. I was instructed for my first assignment to fill a tub for my wife with burning candles around the room. We both do lots of things like that for each other anyway. Some of the assignments are sexual, others not so much. I think I might recommend this book to newlyweds, but not for people that have been married for any length of time. My wife and I both agreed that we have been able to use our own imaginations more evectively than we have been instructed thus far in the book. I would recommend each of you writing down 20 things that you've always wanted to do, regardless of shyness or fear, and put them into a hat. That way you can really spice things up, and save 30 bucks in the process.",0
Low review read why: This order was going to make me happy but instead made me dissapointed because the ends of the posters were crinkled and in addition to that the poster itself on its body was also crinkled.

"A good book that is, sadly, not dated: Although the book takes place in 1946 and concerns rampant anti-semitism, both overt and subtle, it's a book that trancends time. The book's anti-semitism could easily be replaced by any other kind of racism and feel right at home in 2005. The story concerns a liberal Christian writer who takes on a magazine assignment to write about anti-semitism and his angle is to pose as a Jew so he can find out firsthand. It is a rude awakening for him, whether it is a hotel that does not cater to ""those people"" or a fiancee making off-hand anti-semitic remarks and thinking nothing of it. Some people might get thrown by writing that was done fifty years ago, but it is a book well worth reading.",1
"CHEMISTRY LEFT IN THE ACTOR'S TRAILER: Unbeknownst to each other, Mr and Mrs Smith (Brad and Jolie) are assassins, very good assassins. They met ""on the job"", fell in love, and got married but kept their murderous alter egos secret from each other. Now, however, they don't like each other very much. When they both have the same ""job"" to do, their animosity turns into violence toward each other. MR AND MRS SMITH had good potential as a story but instead devolves into is a slick but pedestrian and superficial shoot-em-up. And you know what? I didn't sense any on-film chemistry between Brad and Jolie. They must have left their passion for each other in the actor's trailer before the shoots. MR AND MRS SMITH reminds me a little of THE WAR OF THE ROSES, a much better film about marital conflict that gets physical, although, of course, the plot lines are not that similar. Brad is always cool, but I don't get all the fuss over Jolie: she bored me as did the film.",0
"I was very disappointed: If I could give this book zero stars I would. Halfway through the book I gave up and read the ending, just to get this over with. I loved Patterson's other novels. They always kept me hooked. Too bad for this one.",0

"Amazing Clutch Performance: I put a Centerforce II Pressure Plate on my 1994 Jeep Grande Cherokee, along with a Centerforce Clutch and Centerforce Throwout Bearing, and I have been very impressed at the amazing performance it has given my jeep. It grabs 100% better than my factory clutch ever did, and gives the vehicle a much easier drive and more power for off road wheeling. The peddle feel was a little hard to get used to at first however, I was forced to relearn how to drive my car. I will most likely use this company on my 67' Mustang and 96' MX6 if I ever need to replace their clutches. Wonderful products, will certainly buy again.",1
better every time: Critics said it couldn't be done. O its done and done with gansta sytle. 50 cent's first premire cd blew away all the rap competition and put his respect threw the roof with known masters of the art. Founded by some of the best 50 cents mix of mellow beats and intense lyrics allows this rookie rap alstar confidence and composure superior to all. Skipping from one track to the next this musical masterpeice just keeps getting better and better. From one rap lover to another this cd is a must for a solid collection of strong rap music.,1

The old one held up for several years. The new one which is now made in China is a P.O.S! Just another example of why some american companys should have kept their business here in the good ol' USA. I would have gladly paid more to get a exact USA made replacement, So now here I am currently looking for a different product altogether.",0
"Wanted: An Editor: The pattern here soon becomes familiar. Start with an oddball premise, sometimes shocking, sometimes offbeat, occasionally brilliant. Find a voice, an authentic voice -- perhaps working class, maybe self-obsessed neurotic, occasionally just delightfully kooky. Then, with these admirable ingredients, proceed to beat the reader over the head with this same premise, this same voice, for 30, 40, or 50 pages. While slogging through this, occasionally smiling, sometimes laughing, but mostly drowning, I recalled Jack Kerouac's famous line ""you're a genius all the time."" Kerouac wasn't and neither was DFW.

I went back too look at the bags again because I am looking for a masculine bag for my Marine husband who wouldn't be caught dead carrying this bag. Well... Wouldn't you know it popped up unavailable AGAIN!. I seriously doubt that I bought the last one too. So now I am just waiting for amazon to write me back telling me they are sorry, but they can't process my order. I live in a rural area, and I have no idea where a Babies R Us is down here. I think that the closest one is 2 hours away... Maybe I will have to have my family look out of state where they are and send it to me.",0
"Signifying nothing: After all the shouting has died down, the truth is that Campbell's work looks great - as long as you're sufficiently young at heart that you cannot see how shallow his ideas are.This is a classic example of Western-style religious rebellion, especially in the 1950s and 60s - rejecting one's own traditions in favour of sanitised, homogenised, exotic Eastern teachings. It is romantic, defiant, and ultimately vacuous. Yet for many people, especially, perhaps, those with above average intellect, a flirtation with Campbell's work may be a necessary stage in their development - a part of their own ""hero's journey"".Though fun while it lasts, like all of Campbell's writing there is nothing here of any lasting substance. As Shakespeare so eloquently put it:""It is a tale, told by an idiot,Full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.""It just takes some people longer than others to spot Emperor Campbell's nakedness.",0

But after trying it on several times, I find although it is called Neck and Shoulder Massager, it can not do much to the shoulder and the massage is only done by simple vibration , which comes with the low frequency noise and makes me dizzy after 5 mins. Whenever you turned on the heat option, the strength of the massage gets weaker and the dimension of this thing is too big for asian people and not convenient for travel.",0
Print: It just looks like a cheap tee. The graphics aren't impressive. My husband is a big fan of Metallica but he's owned this shirt for two months and has never worn it.

"Must have missed that....: This book was very disappointing. The authors use of nicknames and other jargon is completely overdone. He spends more time trying to convince you that he was part of a privileged circle. He also focuses on a small handful of factory riders when racing was made up of many stellar privateers. But the beauty of the racing in that era was that all of the riders supported each other, partied together, traveled together and had a very close camaraderie that does not exist in racing today. It did not matter if you rode for H-D or BSA or Triumph or were a privateer - you were friends and stuck together. This author unfortunately does not capture the true essence of that era in racing. Read Gerald Foster's book instead.",0

The video quality is good, it interfaces well to a PC over firewire, small size, decent controls, etc., etc.But, I am returning it.The motor noise on the audio is a killer drawback.I have been taking videos of my 4 month old son but during playback it sounds like there is a locust invasion preparing to bounce during any break in his cooing.I was wondering if I was being too picky so I compared the audio with that of the Canon miniDV I bought in 1998 (yes, 1998) and the Canon was sooooooo much quieter.Too bad....'cos this cam was otherwise very nice.",0

Anything Moffatt!: The song Crazy is really good...very upbeat. Lara is a romantic ballad and Ya Ya is just plain nice. It's very worth it.,1
"One of the most addictive games you will ever play!: These games really bring back memories. I never was really into video games until I found these games and got absolutely obsessed with them. I think that this set would be a good start if you've never played the sims games before at all.You can't beat a game and it's seven expansions on four discs for only $40. I also recommend The Sims 2,and the expansion packs The Sims 2 University,The Sims 2 Nightlife, and The Sims 2 Open for Business.",1
"For Equine Lovers Everywhere: This book was amazing. I loved horses to begin with, but after reading Mary Stanton's work of art, my love for them grew. Her novel showed me a new way of looking at the lives of horses and helped me in my own writings. This book is a MUST for any horse lover.",1
"Read the back cover: I believe this book is a great book. However, people who buys it are not aware that the book is for intermediate level. It is assumed by the author that they should have a basic knowledge of how to use excel. Please read the title, and the back cover page to let you know for who it is written. This book was not written for beginners, do not give a bad review about it if you do not know how to use excel at all. Buy a book that is for you. a beginner level book not a beginner to intermediate level.",1
Great Book to have as a collector: I love poetry and this Book on nineteenth century american classics is must have for any one who reads books. This is a keeper and a collectors must have book. M coleman,1
"Several Negative Elements: The biggest problem was with the film were the swimming scenes of the hot springs near Laodicea, featured during the introduction and further during the segment on Laodicea. A distance picture is featured on the cover of the DVD case but they showed much more of the Water Park from the Hot Springs. The Music is far from conservative, with a rock beat (soft and medium) mixed through the film. Somewhat minor, but David Nunn has a little bit of a quirky personality. Other than reading from Revelation 2-3, Nunn used no other scripture. It was very obviously recorded while on a tour group. Adding to the problem of attire in the group there was really no discretion regarding the crowds at each of the different sights.",0
"Looks great & unconventional office supply: Like its office supply mates (see other reviews), this acrylic tape dispenser is sturdier than you'd think by its sleek and chic look.Complements any office decor with style, and gets the job done.Not the heaviest tape dispenser, but I haven't had problems with tearing tape off: It doesn't tip over, and the tape cuts where it's supposed to.Recommend. :-)",1
"Wake Me When It's Over: 1.) I'm bored 2.) He uses too many allusions to other novels, so that if you're not well read, this book makes no sense. 3.) Most American readers are not fluent in French, so to have conversations or interjections in French with no translation, is plain dumb. 4.) Did I mention I was bored? 5.) As with another reviewer, I agree, he uses a lot of huge words that just slow a person down. And it's not for theatrics either, it's just huge words mid-sentence when describing something simple. Nothing in the sense of imagery is gained. 6.) Also, to sum it up, it's a story about a pedophile, whether you interpret it as something else or not, is up to you, but there's the main plot for you. I would not reccomend this book to any of my friends.",0
"Tae Bo: When I was first introduced to the video ""Tae Bo"" I thought it was a great workout video. It was something new that I'd never tried before and no matter how long i did this workout, i could never get tired i recommend this for anyone trying or wanting to stay in shape it's great and i give it 5 stars or like sisko and ebert, i give it two thumbs up!",1
"Extremely Disappointed: My 4-year-old son and I both love the ""old"" PJ Sam games. So needless to say I was very excited to see the new software in store. I picked one up and gave to my son for Christmas and much to my dismay, it just wasn't the same. Moving from scene to scene is so slow. It seems like the new game is less sophisticated than the older ones. Very disappointing for me and my son.",0
"The Magic Was Lost: As a fan of Ly de Angeles non fictional work I was delighted to learn of her new book, The Quickening. I couldn't have been more disappointed.I found the plot of this book to be almost incoherent with mini stories loosely tied together in what amounted to tedious chaos. The ill developed characters were equally overly heroic or overly villainous, all sporting chips on their shoulders the size of Texas. It is clear that Ly de Angeles was attempting to bring the Sidhe, the Tuatha de Danann into every day life for us, and that is commendable, but all she achieved was to make them look common and washed out. The magic was lost.Ly de Angeles is capable of far more. Some of her work is visionary & extraordinary but this is not one of them.",0
Not a good solution: I've been using these for a few weeks with my 2 and a half month old. They are too long so it's impossible to get the car seat straps as tight as they should be. He also hates the cramped feeling around his head and cries when I use them. I had to stop using them.,0
1 yr is all you get: This can has done everything advertised. Went through 2 rounds of batteries in 1 year which is actually quite good. The motor died almost exactly 1 yr to the day I bought it. $200 a yr for a trash can is too steep but it was great while it lasted,0
"An unsurpassed love story: Of all of Jane Austen's adaptations, Persuasion seems to me to be the best. The story of a long-simmering love that was lost and ultimately found again is told in such a subtle manner as to tug at one's heartstrings, and draw us into the enduring love story between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. The two leads are impeccable in their performances...Amanda Root plays a lovelorn Anne who tries to 'speak' her true feelings in gestures rather than words, and Ciaran Hinds makes a dashing Captain Wentworth, who still smarting from Anne's rejection of his proposal years ago, nevertheless still loves her. The rest of the cast do an equally amazing job of playing out their respective parts, and the scenes of the English countryside, and the coastal city of Bath are purely enchanting. A poignant, and well-told love story that will endure through time, and definitely worth multiple viewings!",1
USB 2.0 IDE HDD Enclosure: Used this enclosure on a hard drive removed from a dead laptop to be used as a portable drive. Easy to assemble and has worked great; super price on a quality product.,1
"Panasonic doesn't make this product anymore: I bought this massager and had a terrible experience after using it for a couple of months. It stopped working and charging. I contacted the seller asking money back or a replacement and they asked me to contact Panasonic. Upon contacting panasonic, those guys simply sent me a different model (which costed me $15 to ship it to them ). It was ridiculous the way Amazon handled this whole replacement I wanted to get done and the seller was also dumb enough to understand the problem I was facing. I say stay away from this model!!!! This has now discouraged me from buying any electronics from Amazon.",0
"I bought this ...and like it.: I like the iPod dock overall. It's easy to use and the remote works well. It's not quite as intuitive with the controls as I would like. For example, you have to hit ""MENU"" to go up a level. And ""SELECT"" to play something. You can't just hit the play button.The on-screen display is black and white, like the old PONG games of the 70's. I expected it to have the same iPod screen look. But that aside it does a good job.",1
"A very interesting book.: This book is about many different famous characters. It tells myths about Theseus, The Pygmies, Antaeus, Hercules, Cadmus, Phoenix, Cilix, Europa, Ulysses, and many more. All of these characters complete many different tasks. I reccomend this book to people of all ages and especially to people that have an interest in mythology.",1

WILL NOT BUY THIS: I couldn't agree with many of you more that feel the movie industry or whatever money hungry enterprize is behind this release that I for one along with about 23 (YES 23) other family and friends will boycott this release. We will purchase the extended blu-ray version when and if that release comes out. We can WAIT until then.,0
Awful!!!: This was a awful book compaired to the others. I havent even finished it yet. The charecters and the story were boring. This one can definatly be missed.,0
Hopefully the next edition of this book will be better: There are several mistakes in the book. Also the solutions for problems printed in the back of the book are incorrect. There are several typos.,0

"good intentions: I was excited when I ordered this pen online--I thought that I could finally put away my separate pen and pencil. However, I was greatly disappointed when I actually sat down to write with it. I would compare the quality of the ink to that of a Bic ballpoint pen. The ink doesn't ""flow"" like a Pilot pen. Maybe the cartridge that came with the pen is a dud. I'm going to give the pen one more chance by ordering a refill cartridge and seeing if that works better. Who cares if it can write upside down and under water? I just want it to write decently on dry land.",0
"""compelling and rich"": I completely enjoyed this movie. It wasnt fast paced, but never seemed to lag. The realistic storytelling centering around urban youths reminded me of ""Kids"" and ""A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints"". The acting was natural and compelling, and the story carried the weight of intensity without being violent. Not large in scope but just a collection of really good acting performances which made me forget about the camera.",1
"Great when they work...: I've got nothing new to add to many of the less than favorable reviews of these speakers. Bottom line is they sound great out of the box, but aren't built to last. Like a lot of other reviewers, mine developed a problem with crackling and static in less than a year. It's not a problem if you don't mind leaving your speakers on 24/7 and never adjusting the volume/bass. Personally, I'd rather have a pair of speakers that do what they're designed to do without crapping out after 6-12 months.",0
"A great premise, but...: First of all, I love the premise of this novel to death - a mysterious ""pulse"" sent via cell phones turns listeners into crazed, zombie-like killers. Unfortunately, after a great set-up with the main character describing the chaos that breaks out around him as people with cell phones go bonkers, the story quickly turns to rote Stephen King story-telling. I'm talking about vivid dreams that - suprise, surprise - reveal a future plot development, cross-country treks through a ruined society by a motley assortment of lucky survivors, impossible coincidences, and, worst of all, floating, telepathic ""zombies."" The story just turned so damn silly at the end that I was anxioulsy waiting its conclusion.This seems like the sort of story King can write in his sleep. It's strictly by-the-numbers here, folks.",0
"Beautiful: I had looked for Christian Hymns sung in a simple but commited-believing way for a such a long time! So difficult to find here in Germany! Then I ordered this CD! Super! Hit the mark! Simply beautiful! Glorifying the Lord! Thank you, Gary! Only one little mistake: For the title ""Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring"" it says ""Traditional"" in the booklet. That's not true. This melody was written by the composer of composers J. S. Bach! (BWV 147)! Let's give credit where credit is due!PS: Anyone know more of this kind of interpretation of hymns? Write me: fountain@nikocity.de",1
"MUST HAVE FAMILY MOVIE: This is a great movie, and finally an original one. If you enjoyed Toy Story or Bug's Life then you'll enjoy the story of a bunch of chickens trying to escape from Tweety's Farm. The chickens are lead by a single chicken who seems to be the only one who realizes what fate awaits them if they don't escape. There were a bunch of crazy animal lovers who took this movie to be their anthem when it came out, how chickens are locked up like concentration camps, etc...really makes you laugh at the ends to which people will go to get a little publicicity.",1
"A Forgettable Film: A coming-of-age story set in pre-Israel Palestine,The House on Chelouche Street was nominated for the best foreign film in 1973. The focus is on a boy of 15, Sami, who is forced to take work in a machine shop to help support his widowed mother and siblings. The movie follows his transformation from child to man, set against the backdrop of the political violence of the time. The translation is very poorly done, and only some of the dialogue is translated. The white print is sloppily set up against white screens, making it very difficult to read. One gets a sense of the film through watching the actors, not from the dialogue. The movie is not bad, but there are much better movies around in this genre and from this culture.",0
"Don't waste your time or your money on this book!: This book was recommended at an investment seminar so I checked it out at the library (thank God for libraries!). The one good but certainly not ORIGINAL idea is that you shouldn't work for money but let your money work for you. And that's true, if you have any savings, it's folly to leave them earn 2% somewhere and then be taxed on that ""income."" Anyway, the tone of the book is most irritating and condescending, but there is one part that is extremely telling, when he advises an author to take a sales course if she wants to sell her books. She gets annoyed at him for suggesting such a thing to a litterata, but that's exactly what Kiyosaki has done with his books, he's SOLD them well despite all the drivel. Live and learn...",0
"Can't wait to read it with my son!: I have a 2 year old son and I really want to start some Christmas traditions with him. I originally was looking for a classic pop-up version to this book, hoping to find some beautiful illustrations and pull outs/flaps that he would adore for years to come. It looks like the classic pop-ups are phased out (I only found non-traditional versions in pop-up format)This book is wonderful! The illustrations are vivid and traditional, and the binding is durable. The animotion is a bit dark, but that is ok, as it is detailed and there are some on almost every page. I plan to read this with my son every Christmas eve and store it with my Christmas decorations (unfortunately it will not survive on my son's bookshelf LOL).Great deal at $11 with free shipping- the book was original priced for $18!",1
"IS THERE A ""O"" RATING??: I found EXACTLY the same as the previous buyer above, only I run dual monitors on two different computers, that means I purchased four (4) of these totally unreliable things, and after 14 months of use I have only one (1) remaining (and it will probably go out any day now)!! That means I sunk well over a thousand dollars for these three monitors and they've completely gone out, and it was too much to box up and send back for repairs for $250 + shipping each to manufacturer, only to have them go out again soon I'm sure.I WILL NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER, BUY SCEPTRE BRAND MONITORS EVER AGAIN!!I don't mean to be harsh, but I sure feel this brand has been harsh on me, sorry folks.",0

"Pretty good remote: Pros: It does everything it is supposed to do. Easy to program and what a great remote to be able to push one button and turn 3 to 5 units on and all of the correct setting for each. And when I am getting sleepy at the end of the evening, to be able to pick up just one remote and push one button to turn everything off. Wow.Cons: The buttons for such things as pause, stop, start, etc. are not easy to find in the dark. Those buttons should be easier to find by feeling.",1
Love the Facial Brush: Great Brush! I have been looking for a facial brush with nice soft bristles and this is the brush!! The details of the brush are exactly as explained and it feels so soft on my skin.,1
"Waste of Money, Waste of Time: This book is a rip off, and you should avoid it like the plague.The problems aren't from actual LSATs, they're created by the REA. This means you'll spend a lot of time working through problem types that won't appear on the test, and you won't cover a lot that will. They also just feel different than actual LSAT problems, and are substantially more difficult, though not in an educational way.This book is riddled with errors. Some of the rules for the games directly contradict, making entire problem sets worthless. Some of the answers are incorrect, too, although it's impossible to tell because they don't diagram any of the problems out. Instead, enormous blocks of text attempt to walk you through the problem but ultimately just make it more confusing.I'd give this a zero if Amazon let me, there's no reason to buy it.",0

"Bent out of shape: These were so bent up and out of shape when I got them. They were shoved inside a box the size of, and I kid you not, a little bigger than a toilet paper roll. The plastic ear covering on one side is cracked and pulled out longer than the other side that no matter how much you try to reshape them, they are still crooked. If I could have given 1/2 star, I would have. And then they were suppose to come with 2 pair of complimentary sunglasse, I only received one. But since the 2 pair where in such a tiny box, maybe I should be thankful the seller didn't try shoving a 3rd pair in there.",0
"Missing Something: Connery was good. Thurman was good. Fiennes was good. The supporting cast was fair-to-middling. The teddy bear scene was a trip. But the film was lacking a certain carefree quality. It seemed to take its subject matter too seriously and at the same time not give the audience enough time to emerse itself in the world of the film. Overall, a flop.",0
"Great Story: This was an absolute excellent movie. The story line was great. I liked the characters, the actors, and just everything. I give it 10 stars out of 5.",1
"Underrated Marx Brothers: ""Go West"" is a guilty pleasure of mine. Being a big fan of The Marx Brothers, I am always ashamed whilst talking to fellow film buffs when I say that one of my favorite Marx Brothers films is 1940's Go West. And while it's not Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, or A Night at the Opera, it is still a highly enjoyable film, partly due to my love for western films. Some good gags in this one, including the hilarious pick-pocketing scene in the begining and the wild chase on the top of a train at the climax. Overall, if you are a fan of classic comedies or the Marx Brothers, you won't want to miss this. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun.",1

"Don't Buy: Good luck winding the coil on the paper toilet roll.....it is extremely difficult for an adult and impossible for most small children. I tossed in the garbage halfway (about 40minutes) in winding the coil, only to half that part ""spring"" out and kink as soon as my finger slipped off it once.",0
"Way too confusing: This book may be understandable for a professor. But as a student, it is way too confusing for a person who is just learning econometrics to grasp. A student can get really lost in this book. Overall, it is not worth the money to purchase",0
"It's good, but NOT the original motion picture sound track!: Without question, Jerome Morass' ""The Big Country"" is one of the greatest motion picture sound tracks of all time! However, this is NOT the original sound track. Tony Bremmer and the Philharmonia Orchestra deliver an excellent and credible performance, but it is still missing the ""spark"" of the original. I give it four stars because of the material and it's a must have for any serious film score collector. If I have to wait until the ""original"" becomes available, this rendition is a good way to pass the time!",1
"You get what you pay for!: This product is ok for the price but has several features missing that I would have liked. The one I got doesn't track fiber or sodium. But the major problem I have with it is that you can't connect it to a computer to print out a weekly diet sheet. Also you can only add 100 foods that are not listed and they only include 800 foods, so I find that I'm adding ""raw egg"" instead of ""boiled egg"" because it is not listed and I don't want to waste my 100 entries on something that has the exact same calories. Also the closure on it is a little bit hard to open. I will probably use it until I get something better and then sell it to someone in my diet group (or on ebay).",0

"Excellent Stories but Questions Hold: I have had this book for many years, and the stories in it are the definition of ""short sweet and too the point"", making it a very good read for those in it's target demographic, the only thing holding me back from a 5 rating is the title, ""True Tales"" I ran a search on several of the stories looking for some supplemental information but was unable to find any news reports or confirmation of these stories happening, Unless someone could bring forward evidence to the contrary I would be hesitant to list this as Nonfiction. Accuracy notwithstanding this is still a very good read.",1

"Relentlessly Boring: Watching this movie was as excruciatingly painful as the real life characters and story.Two of my friends walked out before seeing the entire dreadful extravaganza. If I want to experiencethe pain and suffering of people in poverty, all I need to do is turn on the Los Angeles nightly newsto see the latest drive-by shooting in Compton, or a dead body found in a dumpster in San Dimas, or the latest group of illegal immigrants arrested and deported, or the latest DEA drug bustPrefer reveling in the extraordinary scenic beauty of Rio, the incredible Brazilian cuisine, the fantastic music,the world-class Carnaval, and the vitality and joy of the special people who live there.I always judge a film by whether or not I will view it again. I'll donate my copy to someone who prefers sufferingover joy and happiness.",0

"Too much useless information: I'm Korean and bought this to brush up on my language skills. Half the book is filled with a stupid introduction that has nothing to do with the language. The remaining portion teaches things you can learn on television. This is a commercial book for people who want to have it in their bookshelf to show off. This is not a good book to learn from. They don't even have the alphabets listed together on one page that can serve as a reference for writing skills!!!!!!! If you don't have something as basic as that, the glossary in the back isn't going to help you out very much. Returned the book as an unsatisfied customer.

"Repetitive: Adler offers few fresh insights in this sequel to ""Understanding Human Nature"" as it mostly repeats his concepts of inferiority feelings and social feeling. In fact, one of the later chapters lifts sections of the first book word for word. Moreover, Adler veers into prejudice in his ardent promotion of social cooperation by suggesting single people or those without children are failing to meet their obligations to contribute to society. He also misattributes homosexuality to attachment issues. His first book is a classic - among the best I've ever read on psychology. This one is better left in the 1930s.",0

"The Palmer Diary of the Revolutionary War: This is a small booklet and came from the seller so quickly! It was really well packed in cardboard and a plastic enclosure to protect it. Thank you for that. It is an account of Colonel Jonathan Palmer in Stonington, Ct, during 1774-75. Actual reproductions of his actual writings are included with history also. A good read for anyone interested in the Revolutionary War times. I have very fortunate to find these wonderful books from Amazon and from buyers that are located in other states to have and far from where I live.",1
"A Second Classic: While the songs on this second self titled LP aren't as uniformly brilliant as those on his debut,and the overall tone is more somber than before, this is still an essential recording. The first single ""Prayer For The Dying"" is actually a better song than the much lauded ""Kiss From A Rose"" (overplayed through most of 1994-95) and stands only second to the astonishing ""Bring It On"" which opens the LP. The sound and textures here are a tad more organic and acoustic than the first album and lend the songs a nice warmth. ""Don't Cry"" sounds a little sappy to me now, but the sentiment is still nice and his ""duet"" with Joni Mitchell ""If I Could"" is a pleasant, if inessential addition since you can barely hear her underneath the production. This is a good transistional effort that further cemented his popularity with American listeners.",1
"Unfulfilling, often frustrating diary of a for-hire skipper: Skipper Heutink clearly enjoys sailing, and occasionally enjoys his paying guests' company too, but he consistently fails to give us much to care about. I found this book frustrating because the author focuses on his infatuation with pretty girls (he's married and his son is his first mate), the daily trivia of mooring, cooking, and drinking, and how proud he is of his son and the trimaran he built. The prose is poorly edited and hard to parse, mostly due to Heutink's inconsistent nautical jargon, tendency to omit salient details, and failure to include maps with the names of places he visits. He's no storyteller; this is a fleshed-out (and mostly pretty dull) diary with no connective tissue. I learned nothing, and had more questions at the end than when I started the book.",0

In my case, I was in need of something relatively small & firm to raise the front legs of a bedroom dresser that had sunken into the carpet.These little guys were a perfect fit & raised the dresser just enough to prevent the drawers from sliding out on their own. They even have adhesive, if needed for slick surfaces. Since only two were required, I'm already prepared for the next feat of engineering that needs their help.",1
"He knows the ""business"": Finally, a mystery writer with a background in business. What Grisham does with the world of law, Scott does with the world of economics. His writing is brilliant--clever plot, memorable characters and savory details. He's definitely got an audience for this book. I can't wait to read the next one.",1
"This guide is crap, buy the Original Snake Eater guide: This guide is complete crap. Don't waste your money on this guide unless you want online maps. BUY THE ORIGINAL SNAKE EATER GUIDE. This guide does not cover details on the camo, face paints, weapons, CQC (close quarters combat), or show the locations of the kerotans.",0
"Gertrude & Alice .... the real deal !!: Oh my goodness .. if you've been 'enamored' of Gertrude & Alice for years & years, or are just discovering them .. this is THE story of their lives together. Grab this book before it goes out of print again !!",1
Barry White disappoints: I love Barry White! I couldn't wait to get home to play this CD. Unfortunately it seems heavy handed in the treble end and loses those deep tones one looks for. The essential sound of the Dr. of Love is there in those low spoken introductions. Mix of the great hits of the 70's plus more recent songs. Improves with the right company and the lights down LOW........,0
"Watch is okay, the band is not: Title says it. The watch itself is fine, the band looks nice at first, but gets broken in couple of months. The weak area is where it connects to the watch, and it is really weak. This is watch for kids, probably first watch for most, and this was not great experience.",0
"Best Watch: As an avid purveyor of watches, I added this on about a year ago. Probably the best purchase I have ever made. I get countless comments on how good it looks. This is great for the office and also great for casual outings. You will not regret purchasing this watch.",1
god they really suck: this love is their only good song and it's overplayed and sounds very familiar cause the formula has been done over and over again year after year. The lead singer sounds like a screeching cat on the rest of this CD,0
"Perfect for organizing, but not very pretty: Perfect for organizing my shoes and saving some space in my closet, but it's not very pretty to the eye. I'm happy with it though.",1
Very Inaccurate: Upon receiving the Slime 2021-A Tire Gauge I tested it on 4 tires of a known air poundage which was 40 lbs (checked by two other gauges). The Slime 2021-A gauge read that they were at 80 lbs. so obviously something is wrong with the Slime 2021-A. I'm glad that the other reviewers had good results but mine are so bad as to render this gauge to be useless and I expect to send it back to Amazon.,0
"Not a ""Real"" Watch: The Stuhrling watches are great for show but are unfortunately of horrible quality!Do not expect this watch to work for long! Its also a big watch!",0
"Poorly made: I can't believe $17,000.00 was spent on this piece of tripe. Where did the money go? This movie had bad acting, bad lighting, bad sound, bad camera work, bad editing with the same establishing shots shown over and over and over again in nothing more than a lame attempt to get the running time to feature length.I have seen movies made with less money that are extremely high quality and entertaining.",0
"Really silly, tiny target.: Couldn't believe how toy-like this target turned out to be. It's very small. Very. And the if you place the sides into the ground, you're down at squirrel level trying to aim.",0
"A must have for the serious XML practitioner: There are plenty of generic XML books out there, plus a bunch of titles that focus on specific XML applications or XML related topics (SOAP, XSLT, XML Schema etc); what Mr Harold delivered this time is something different, that really stands out from everything else available at the time of this writing. This book is about best practices, patterns and anti-patterns, and about how to use XML correctly and efficiently. As with other titles from the same author, this book is a pleasure to read, clean, informative and well structured. In my opinion a must have for the serious XML practitioner. Be advised this is not a book for beginners, the author takes for granted you already mastered the fundamentals of XML and many related technologies like DTD, Schema or Namespace. In order to really get the best out of it you better have some experience using XML under your belt.",1
"The best: The program is proof positive that programing can be great with out violence, filthy language and bombs .Hollywood directors take note.",1
awesome book: This is one awesome book and 100 percent the truth.The gentleman who owns this book needs to sell it to me.Amazon has my offer.Thank you.,1
Not exactly waterproof!: Had this watch for less than 1 year. It is supposed to be waterproof to a depth of over 600 feet. Went swimming in a pooland the water obviously came inside the watch. Wasnt even waterproof to 6 feet!Called Invicta about warranty repair. The cost of the WARRANTY repair is $28 + shipping!,0
"Lovely traditional Christmas story: Christmas stories are ""a dime a dozen"", so I'm always on the lookout for an especially meaningful one. The Cobweb Christmas is a gem. It tells the story of how tinsel came to be used on Christmas trees. This is a medium-length story, so one for kids who've developed an attention span. If you're looking for something different that focuses on the magic and beauty of the holiday then you're sure to enjoy The Cobweb Christmas.",1
"asylum: this is very amazing. nothing like first addition.... so you can watch this without watching first. dark, but smart story.",1
"One word - ....: 3 things keep this from being a great movie. 1. Daredevil DOES NOT KILL! This is a violation of the very core of the character, who believes that the legal system must decide someone's fate. 2. Matt fights Electra in a park in front of a crowd of people, openly displaying his ""powers."" 3. Speaking of powers, Daredevil only has heightened senses, not the ability to jump from a skyscraper and land feet-first without becoming the Human Accordion. Whilie it's necessary to use a little tweaking of the story here and there when bringing a comic that's been running 20+ years to the big screen (see SpiderMan for an example of how to do it properly), the liberties taken with this character were too much.",0
"Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, The Masterpiece Science Edition: This book is just a re-print of the regular version with the same title- there is nothing special about it, so don't be fooled. Quite the contrary- it is horribly laid-out/edited and looks like someone never proof-read it for layout/format. It is even difficult to discern where each chapter (section) ends and the next begins (yes, it really is that bad). I haven't noticed any additional or different content in this book (despite what the title and description of the book elude to), when compared with the regular version.Einstein's original [translated] content in the book is in fact all there, and intact, and naturally quite good, but this edition of the book is just a poor quality reprint. If you are interested at all in this title/topic, simply buy the regular version, ""Relativity: The Special and the General Theory"". It is a proper version of Einstein's book.",0
"Not for young children. Promos mask its real darkness.: The advertisements for this film that you see on other DVDs and videos are purposely and horribly misleading. You buy this video expecting a joyous musical romp with animals of the Serengeti for your children. Plain and simple this is a movie of death. The lead character dies a horrible death and there are fights to the death. This is not a children's movie. See the first ""Editors"" comments. Compared to NEMO, artistically the animation is simply not that great. The background scenes are repetitious. Disk 2 is basically an advertisement for the musical. My youngsters never get tired the the original Disney Jungle Book. We've seen it hundreds of times. We viewed this movie once and that was enough.",0
"Best thing since sliced bread!: This is a great book, it tells you in a straightforward way how to analyze your longitudinal data to answer questions of critical importance in the social sciences. It's not wedded to one particular piece of software, as many books on statistical topics are, but uses examples of real data and different software (HLM, MLwiN, SAS, Stata) to conduct the analyses. An absolute must for the researcher who collects longitudinal data.",1

"Charming old-fashioned story: This is a charming mystery story, a period piece written and set in the early 1900s, and woven through with a bit of light romance. I love well-written old books and was delighted to discover this one by Louis Tracy, free in the Kindle edition. There was the occasional ""printing"" glitch, but nothing highly annoying or indecipherable. If you like old books and don't mind idealized womanhood, you may enjoy this book.",1
"Worst product ever: One star is way too high, this is the absolute worst product I've ever purchased. Everything *almost* works, nothing actually works. I tried SD cards, CF cards USB memory sticks, NOTHING worked all the way through. Some times the system will crash when you plug in a card, sometimes it (says) it records for two hours but then hangs ""closing"" the file, mostly it just says there is not enough space on an empty 2GB card to start recording a 5 min video. After several hours trying I never did get a single video to record and work. TRASH, I usually just put up with bad design, or leave it to rot in the basement, this one is going back. No more Neuros for Ken.Neuros OSD Media Center (6011000)",0
"Great For Doors: If you need to trim door slabs (other than pre-hung)- this is the best tool. It produces very smooth cuts with little effort. It is also quiet. I'm not sure if a dust bag is available - the tool throws a lot of dust, so be ready. I have used it to trim up to 1/4 inch of 80 inch long doors (precor masonite doors). The tool is prefect - provides a very straight finished edge that can not be accomplished using any other power tool, even a table saw",1

"Useless: Swaddling is great if you use the right blanket, but this one isn't it. It's too stretchy for a tight fit and the ""easy diaper change"" feature makes it too easy for the baby to kick out one or both legs, which just wakes them up. You'd be better off buying a Miracle Blanket. They're more expensive, but they actually work.",0
"More books, please , Ward: Finally, I'm also looking forward to storytime. My 2 year old loves this book and so do I. The right combination of beautiful illustartions (you should have posters too) with a sense of humor, with counting. She points at the grapes, peas with glasses and recognizes ""grandpa."" We'll be waiting for your next book!",1
"what is it with turkish food?: This stuff was so bitter, i got goosebumps and shudders. I also bought some rose flavored turkish delight and same reaction. Seriously, how do they manage over there? I read reviews about this Halva being SO GOOD that you have to restrain yourself from eating it in one fell swoop. I really can't see that happening. I can see it going into the trash tho if no one else in the house will eat it. Also it was nearly impossible to just slice up as it fell apart in crumbles.",0
"Great music!!!: On this CD, Harry is back to his New Orlean root. Very lovely! The music & lyrics seem to intice me to visit this wonderful place.",1
"A modern-day Christmas Carol: Imagine Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol set in the modern world. That's what director Richard Donner and writers Mitch Glazer & Michael O'Donoghue have brought us. Instead of 19th-Century Britain, it's now 20th-Century New York City. Instead of Ebenezer Scrooge, we get Bill Murray as Frank Cross. Instead of sentimental drama, we get some satirical and verbal comedy. The only things that stays the same are the three ghosts, the Scrooge personality, and the definition of Christmas. I wouldn't consider this one of the greatest films of the holidays, but I will say that it works well as a Bill Murry comedy. There are dozens of funny jokes and plentiful sight gags that you can enjoy watching again and again. Overall, I'd say that this is a very good Christmas film and I did enjoy watching it, but please not that it may not be appropriate for little kids.",1
Ridin' High: I think it's one of Jerry Jeff's best. I especially like Night Rider's Lament. I would recommend this one to all Jerry Jeff fans.,1
"Not so impressed: Well, it doesn't keep the coffee warm for very long at all. The switch turns off and there is no warming plate under the thermos. Less than an hour after making the coffee and it is nothing but lukewarm. If you add some cream, it's no good at all.I'm also miffed that just after I bought it, Amazon lowered the price. Did they do that because it doesn't work very well?",0
"The Worst Textbook I've Ever Had: This book is without a doubt the worst textbook I have ever been assigned in a college course. It is useless as a reference, it is boring, and the layout does nothing more than confuse the reader. I knew that this textbook was bad when I tried to look up a formula that I had forgotten. The book was not able to explain to me something that I ALREADY KNEW. What a shame.",0
Best Simchas Torah gift!: We bought this plush Torah for out 10-month-old. He grabbed it and snuggled with it right away. He held it while dancing in his Daddy's arms. Smiles all around. I definitely would recommend this toy to parents who want their kids to relate to Torah.,1

"There is a much better product.: I bought both this product and the Waterfall Soap Saver by Jobar. I find the Waterfall Soap Saver to be a much better product but unfortunately, at this time, I see it is not available. After buying the Waterfall Soap Saver, I would not use this product. Please see my review on the the Waterfall Soap Saver.There are a number of problems with this product. It is made of metal and I would not use it on my counter-tops because I am concerned with scratching. It says it is made of stainless steel but it appears to be chrome. Because of the other reports of rusting with this and other ""stainless steel"" bath products, I suspect it is not made of stainless steel or it is made with a very poor grade of stainless steel. The design requires constant cleaning.In summary, buy the Waterfall Soap Saver instead. Ask Amazon to re-stock it.",0
"I love this.: It very different from the yoga I am use to. At first I didn't want to do it because I thought it was weird, but once I tried it I felt great. The fire breathing and the gentle aerobics are awesome. I dont see myself getting bored of this anytime soon.",1
One of C.S. Lewis's best: I loved this book! It can difficult at times to read but the struggle is worth it. Check out The Great Divorce also by C.S. Lewis.,1
Times Up Game - a hoot!: Our family played this game on Christmas Day and had a blast. I laughed until I cried at some of the charades. It's a great educational game in that you have to remember (or learn) historical and other famous figures. Can be a family game but also recommended for teens and adults as a party game. I would highly recommend this game.,1
"Solid Rock & Roll: As a fan of the Crue since the Theater Of Pain days, New Tattoo is definitely classic Crue. This follow-up to the less-than-popular Generation Swine CD shows the Crue at their best. Hell On High Heels gets the CD off to a fast start and it never slows from there. This is one of the few CD's that does not have a bad song on it. Vince, Nikki, Mick and Randy really outdid themselves. If you are a fan of just solid rock and roll, than this CD is definitely worth buying. Though it is difficult to pick any one song as a favorite, some of the notables also include ""Hollywood Ending"", ""Dragstrip Superstar"" and ""1st Band On The Moon"".",1
"My eyes!: Ack, how did this steaming pile of cinema ever get made?Matt Leblanc proved his acting talents peaked with ""Friends"", but then again with such a lousy script, I'm not even sure Harrison Ford could have attempted such lines and come out with his career unscathed.William Hurt is miscast here. He just doesn't strike me as the idealistic scientist type with his low key mumbling. The space uniforms were very wierd....watching Lacey Chabert (presumably 14 years old at the time) wearing a skintight outfit ... makes ya feel wierd, though I didn't mind it much on the older chicks.Gary Oldman plays his tired evil-guy sniveling role yet again, and while its nice to have cute kids and robots in movies, this is definitely not a kiddie film with all the violence and stuff blowing up.",0
"Not American made quality!: The clear plastic percolator window on top has broken with light use. It should have been made of glass like the old quality percolatos like Revere. If you buy this, be prepared to shell out for a glass top, which is available and should be on all new percolators. Made in China but with the mask name of a rugged American mountain/park is just more bucks in the pocket of some CEO.",0
"This is awful.: This is a terrible movie. It won't satisfy those looking for a gay film, nor someone who wants to watch a horror film. Only the most depraved sadomasochist could enjoy something like this--and they would have to put up with a ludicrous plot, senseless torture and, above all, the worst acting I've seen in a horror film, which is saying a lot.",0
"They don't ship the item shown: This is the second time I've ordered this item from Amazon. They don't ship the product that is shown with the plastic, black sleeves. They ship a lesser product you can buy from Office Depot for $20 with a three-ring metal binder. I've had to return this item twice now, because the company doesn't ship what is shown. Very annoying. I have one of the CD binders pictured already, and I needed a second one, but I can't get Amazon to do the right thing and ship what they are showing in their pictures. False advertising--buyer beware.",0
"Not for me: At 1mm these picks feel too thick and stiff. To the touch they feel powdery or dusty for some reason, an unpleasant feel. After a few minutes of playing they make your fingers sweat and become very slippery- unlike any other pick I've tried. Because of that, after 2 or 3 uses the print on the pick starts smudging. I'll say though that the sound they generate is very crisp and bright. They are also very durable. But they're just no fun to use. Celluloid picks are still my favorite. But I have purchased a tortex pick from a band at a concert. It's unbranded, smaller, has print on both sides and yet exhibits none of the problems that this Dunlop pick has. So the issue isn't the tortex material itself. I suspect it's something Dunlop does, or most likely doesn't do; some surface treatment at the end that they are skipping on to save money I bet.",0
"Ahhhh, should have believed the reviews!: Yep, people weren't kidding. After a few sheets were printer, the cartridge error mentioned here so many times happened. But hey, for $5 you might get lucky.",0

"The Gold Standard for Music DVDs: This DVD was excellent. It sets the standard for correctly produced video performances. The stage seting, lighting, camera work and of course sound were the best. Mr Klugh said not one word during the entire performance. There was about five seconds of claping before the next cut...YES! All music all the time! If you like Jazz and especially guitar you will not be disappointed!",1
"OMG!!!!!: I place this movie in the ""World's Worst Movie"" category. It was so hard to follow as it constantly jumped from reality to fantasy and back to reality and I was soooooo sick of the emphasise being put on her nails bleeding and the scratches on her back (and that the psycho girl needed to lose her virginity.) I can't believe Portman won an Oscar for this or that the movie (on it's own) was reconized for anything. I watched this on HBO and will NEVER PURCHASE the DVD, total waste of money. TERRIBLE MOVIE.",0

"Agree with others that Win98 is Less Stable than Win95: If you have Win95 don't upgrade to Win98 - It is less stable and many of the programs for Win95 just plain do not work. Maybe WinME is better but it is still based on DOS - Microsoft is always announcing that their next version is going to be better -Well, we're are still waiting.",0
"NOT for everyone: Yes, it's an expensive cast. Yes, it's beautifully made. Yes, it makes an excellent job of conveying a particular mood.The trouble is, there is no let-up from that mood. Two hours of a downward spiral of doom, depression, angst, despair, and suicide, with no let-up at all. With no refrain from such melancholy I was relieved when it ended - the film is lacking in contrast somewhat.I wasn't left with anything at the end of the movie - just a desire to cheer myself up. It didn't make me question anything and it didn't raise any issues for me. I found it unchallenging - the only challenge was following the dense plot and the tedious, whispered monologues.Your mother might like it - but she'll wonder what you're trying to say when you give it to her.",0
"A disappointment: While finding a line of salt free beans at a reasonable price was great, I have had a hard time using up these kidney beans, they are mushy; unpleasantly so. You'd think they would make a good bean in bean soup or refried beans, but I didn't think so. A friend tried them as a shortening substitute in cookies with the best results; taste was fine once she ran the beans through the food processer and added them to cookie dough - but what isn't. Blending them and then using them as an addition to soup or 'secret vegies' in meatloaf and the like may have been the best use.I did a little experimentation and evidently salt helps beans from turning unappealingly mushy. I've learned to either cook my own and add just a touch of salt or use a 'low salt' product. Color and size are good.",0
Great movie: The whole family really had fun watching this movie :) I would suggest this movie to anyone that wants to laught.,1
"Think Before You Buy: All you need to know about this book is that there is a disclaimer on the back cover which tells you that Tiger Woods had nothing whatsoever to do with the creation of this book. I bought and read the book before I saw the disclaimer. Stupid me. Shame on me; much more shame on John Andrisani. You won't learn anything, or at least anything useful. Look into Manuel De La Torre or Dede Owens (especially ""Smart Golf"") to really improve your golf game.",0
"Great Companion Book to Sloane's ""Museum of Early American Tools"": This book is an excellent read for the woodworker interested in early American ""know-how"". The sketches are well drawn &, along with Sloane's vivid descriptions and quotes from a few ""Old Timers"", make one feel like Eric is telling you right across the kitchen table how & why early lumber & woodworking tools were made & used. I highly recommend this book AND Mr. Sloane's book ""Museum of Early American Tools"".",1

"Better than Airport Express: Nothing - I mean Nothing works like this. I've searched open source directories, forums, etc. and this is the only thing that will play Microsoft DRM'd music across your house. Airport only plays iTunes - period. So if you want something that will play streaming music vs. lame iTunes then get this. I use it for Zune & Slacker.If you want to have audiophile grade output get this. Sometimes a pain to network if you have multiple routers. But if you have multiple routers chances are you know what you are doing anyway.",1

"Nice, but not worth it: the rio 600 is a sharp player. the sound qualty is great, the features are great. but it isn't worth it unless you have a small collection of audio. it just can't hold that much. 64 mb can hold max 25 good length mp3's. and if you want to upgrade sonic blue is the only palce to buy new memory. instead of removable memory cards, they sell backpacks specially for the rio, and the biggest memory card they sell is 128 mb. the controls are also very difficult to work. they are small and you tend to hit the wrong button. if you are looking for a small mp3 player with good sound, it is nice but i don't think it is worth it.",0

"Misleading product information: The Amazon Editorial Review is incorrect and misleading. The included CD does not offer guidance on two of the fifteen arrangements. No instruction on either ""Strawberry Fields"" or ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" is given. Since those two pieces are the sole reason I bought the book, I am very disappointed.",0
"Don't try this at home...: I found this book a vivid page-turner. Other readers have criticised some of the factual content and feasibility, but this is no reference manual - just sit back and hold tight! Matthew Reilly kept this book fast-paced and the plot literally writhes with incredible, immensely enjoyable, cascades of action.An easy read, my only regret is that the book was flipped out of my hands by the automatic train-doors at Clapham Junction when I was 30 pages from the end...The film that follows can only aspire to the book from a distance.",1
"Pretty Photos and Very Little Else: This book has beautiful photos - but even some of those are mislabelled, claiming to show the wrong place!Other than that, it covers the major tourist attractions of the country in broad, general terms.Even this poor coverage is full of errors and spelling mistakes.Practical information is ranging from the completely absent to the very limited.It may be OK to have this book as a souvenir - certainly not as a guidebook!",0
"HAYWARD PUMP: I hope pumps Okay because it is dead winter but that's why it was $100 cheaper. First box was damaged and returned.

"Dangerous Fortune is a finely crafted historical novel that entertains and informs at the same time.: I recommend A Dangerous Fortune to anyone interested in the tumult of early capitalism and the contest greed and principal set in late 19th century London, peopled by bellievable characters and with just the right mix of intrigue and sexual tension.",1
"Interesting, mult-layered and entertaining!: Wow! What a great, insightful album. Not all the electronica that rumours would have you believe. The album starts out with the great American life and goes right into a fun, poppy ""Hollywood"" A great listen that would be hard to get bored with. The lyrics and the message are inspirational to putting life in perspective and exploring all the facets of life and what is important. I don't mean to say this is some grand statement on life, but it is certainly interesting as well as entertaining. Looking forward to spinning to it!",1
"Corrects for the failures of the ""Anthology"" collection.: This is the same collection as the ""Anthology"" set that was issued a couple of years ago...but this time they got it right and went back and cleaned up the set and digitaly remastered everything....Excellent collection featuring all of the works of Asia from the Geffin years.",1

"Freakin Sweet: When you first see the box cover you might be like what is this.I actually like the cover but I agree with many of you that they should go with the family guy type disc box.Now,for those of you who have never watched the simpsons and have lived in a cave for along time its a great show.Its like family guy only less language and they dont go deep into jokes.But Homer will always enter the scene doing something stupid and hilarious!My opinion season 1 is still funny but you should just skip straight to season3,because the animation is horrific!!!And once you are done watchin all simpson dvds watch FUTERAMA! Thanks Matt G. for true comedy!",1
"Truly puerile (hence its popularity): This 640-page essay in political correctness is a bloated bore of a book whose fanatical reception is a frightening commentary on the utter debasement of U.S. literary ""culture."" If you love comic books, never progressed beyond puberty in your mental and emotional development, think like everybody else does, and have an infinite capacity for tolerating tediousness, this is definitely the book for you. The author is far from unskilled in verbal artistry, but his conception of character, plot, and theme is that of a highly gifted high school sophomore. In short, this is a children's book, not something a mature adult can enjoy.",0
"An unfortunate collection!: I am a fan of countertenors (Scholl, Bowman, Deller, Visse, Jacobs) but I have to say that this album was a complete dissapointment! This album is a joke!!!I especially like Andreas Scholl voice and although in this album his voice is as great as usual I would advice that anyone wanting to listen to really great examples of this countertenor's voice look elsewhere! Try instead one of the many albums of Bach's cantatas where he has appeared, or maybe his Handel arias album called ""Ombra mai fu"", or even his ""Heroes"" album!",0
Clapton Crossroads DVD: Love this DVD. Great to sit & watch or just have playing in background while doing stuff around the house.,1
"Disputing Thomas Thompson: Thompson is among a small group called the biblical minimalists.They say no Israelite nation existed before 800 BC. Yet the Pharoah Mernepthah mentions Israelites in a stgele he had erectd about 1207BC. They say that the Hebvrew Bible is mostly fiction concocted to compete with the Hellenistic of the Greek conquerors in the 4th century BC. In that case, you would expect Greek and Babylonian loan words in the Book of Exodus. But there are none. There are,however, Egyptian loan words.I could go on but don't want this review to take up too much space. Robert Meister, Brookline. MA.",0

Favorite Sandals: I have been wearing Reefs since high school and I am now in my 30s. They feel and look great and are just very comfortable. I have tried other brands in the past but just keep coming back to Reefs. The smoothy sandal is traditional and goes with anything. I love them!,1
"Outsorced to China: Made in China. Another good product that a company doesn't care enough about to make in their own country to maintain quality control and support it's citizens, but only their greed. Don't buy it. You can see that it's made in china by visiting their website and looking at the instructions pdf download on the bottom left corner. Terrible state of affairs that we live in.",0
"The kitchen counters are MINE again!: My cats absolutely loved to get on my kitchen counters and drink from any dish I had in the sink. I tried everything: Double-sided duct tape, aluminum foil, shaking cans, and water guns. Nothing worked. Then I decided to give this thing a go. Well let me tell you, this device got the job done. After just a couple of air sprays, the sound alone scared them off. Now they won't go on my counters at all if the spray can is there, even if the thing is turned completely off!Note: The sensor is quite sensitive. It's been known to pick up movement a good 10 or even 15 away. As a result, I recommend placing it on the *front* of the counter and aimed toward the back. (Don't forget to pick it up when startled kitty knocks it over. ;))",1
"Save yourself 2 trips to the doctor, and it's paid for: This is SO worth the money!I really wanted this, but didn't want to spend the money. A friend of mine and I went to lunch (she has a 9 mo old and I have a 7 mo old) one day and she had a Floppy Seat. I didn't. It was appauling to me how much our daughters were putting the straps in their mouths; hers on the strap of the Floppy Seat, mine on the chair provided by the restaurant. YUCK! So, as I reasoned with my husband, you have to figure that this seat costs the equivalent to two doctor visits.We ALL love it! I love how wide it goes on a shopping cart seat, because my daughter always seems to want to nap at the store. So, I just lay her sideways! It's obviously comfortable, because she falls asleep sometimes.Did I mention that this is worth the money??",1

I got this for my sister, even though it had pretty bad reviews, because she wanted it so much. Bad idea...it stinks and she was super disappointed. I am sure, with the technology out there, this product can be much better eventually. Sorry my review is so harsh, but it needs to be. I really feel they can put out a much better product.",0

"The ride is so smooth: It would be easy to forget this CD as a whole, due to the fact that its title track became an anthem of a generation. Taken in the context of the whole, though, ""1999"" is the one that put him not just on the map, but on several. Prince had been well-known to R&B listeners, but this one took him mainstream in a whole new way. He held nothing back in his lyrics or music, which managed to chronicle the fears and forays of a decade.",1
"Saved the day from enamel!: I was painting clear, glass vases white for wedding center pieces. Not a good idea to start with, but my wife wanted it done. I laid down 3 spray enamel coats over the course of a couple weeks because it tends to run and not go on very thick. On applying the 4th and final coat, about half paint ended up crinkling. I didn't change technique or anything.After finding this epoxy spray paint, I literally sprayed ONE coat that was very thick and perfect every time. The paint is extremely sticky, as you might imagine, being epoxy. Overspray sticks to shoes, clothes, etc, and WILL NOT come off. This is the best stuff I've seen yet.",1
"Come back, Martin Amis!: I wait for Amis' books like I would the Second Coming, and I'm usually not left wanting. Unfortunately this was not my experience with YELLOW DOG. I felt at times he was trying to emulate Burroughs' cut-and-paste technique with the plot, but I didn't empathize enough with the characters to want to go back and retrace my steps. Yes, there's some diamond-sharp prose in this book, but it doesn't hang together. Where's the brilliance of LONDON FIELDS? The belly laughs of THE INFORMATION? Sorry, Martin, but you lost me on this one.",0
"Disappointed: Couldn't wait to watch the movie, but realized that the quality of the DVD wasn't very good when it started freezing for short periods of time, and then froze for about five minutes at one point. I put the DVD into another player and it did the same thing, so I realized it was not the player. I had to take it somewhere and swap it for another copy, which turned out fine.",0
"BRIDGES THE GAP....: I recently heard one of the cuts on this album, SUMMER OF MY DREAMS, composed by David Mallett, and I HAD to have it. I was not familar with either Kathy Mattea OR David Mallett before, although I've since learned that he's written some pieces that most of us know. HER voice is haunting and beautifully rich. I really like all but one of the pieces on this album, and plan to make a tape for my car. This album bridges the gap between country and folk music beautifully, and I heartily recommend it.",1
"Star Wars: Honor and Duty: A nicely written side story of the Star Wars saga. This gives the reader a view of things for the view of individuals not normally seen or heard from, unless Darth Vader is killing them. Good quality graphics and a nice flow of the dialogue. It would be a good addition to your Star Wars collection because it shows that there were others involved and how their upbringing, duty, honor and family affected their decisions, ultimately affecting how the ""big"" conflict turned out.",1

"A Boring Rehash: This isn't a biography ... it reads like a new version of ""The Films of Joan Crawford."" What a lame idea to try and tell a person's life story by listing and describing the films they made ... what does this have to do with her personal life? OK, so they wanna refute Christina ... but, geez, guys, how about a little objectivity? Or new information? Or how about some photos that have not been used and re-used in every Crawford book since the Jazz Age?",0

Pretty swing but didn't work for us.: The swing is lovely - colors are great but it's tight fitted - no space. My grandbaby was only 3 months and it was snug. The head support it sewed on therefore you can't remove it. The tray is a chore to take off and put on. The lightshow was great but the knobs and music worked at random. I returned it.,0
"astonishing: There are poems in this volume that will make you laugh, more that will break your heart, still more that will make you gasp in amazement, and still more that will make you recognize you've just made a huge discovery in Lisa Haynes.The poems each carry an individual power, but their collective effect is exponentially more intense. It's been a while since I've read a book of poetry that really feels like a book, a whole, an entity. This one is its own complete experience.Lovers of American poetry in particular will enjoy this book, and recognize antecedents in William Carlos Williams and others. Even without that categorization, though, the sensuality, compassion, forthright honesty and unsparing language here is refreshing and often astonishing.",1
"Vile,disgusting and totally a waste of time and money: If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I bought this book,tried to read it and was so repulsed that I tore it up and threw it away. I felt like I needed a spiritual bath. I had never destroyed a book before and have not done since. I own hundreds of books of all different genres. I would never recommend anyone reading this. I was disappointed since there were so many positive reviews. Buyer beware. I am not a fan of the ""Left Behind"" series and was hoping for a decently written end times novel.",0
"Old School: Nice ornate drawings and rich colors (I especially love the yellows and reds... my brother said they looked ""evil"").Cards seem decent quality, and little booklet included with background and history along with reading spreads and brief divination meanings for all the cards.Seems like all you need for a good tarot starter.Price is worth the cards alone; the book leaves things to be desired if you want more in depth info.",1
"Don't start this one at night!: This was my first book in the series. I loved it. The characters were clearly drawn. I could taste the ravioli and empathize with both Carina and her yearning for her husband's love and his inability to give it. I won't spoil the story, but this was a compelling, real book. I think most women will be able to identify with Carina in some way. Great job! I'll be waiting for book 3.",1
"Inexspensive, yet still not a good value: I bought these speakers without hearing them because I just wanted basic sound for one of my computers. I had an older Altec Lansing satellite/subwoofer computer speaker system that was only slightly more expensive, so I expected these to sound reasonably good because the older ones sounded quite good for the price. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, but I was very disappointed when I hooked them up and started listening to some music. They are very dull and there seems to be some plastic resonance to the sound. Bass is nonexistent. Low midrange is about as low as these will go. Do not expect any ""punch"" whatsoever. News clips, fine, but music and even movies suffer.",0
"I really should have paid more attention to the reviews: Let this be a lesson - don't look at the number of stars, read the reviews. With the number of big name actors, how could this movie be so blah? About the only positive point I can make is that the unarmed fight scenes looked realistic.",0
"Idea Great, Execution Not: Herbert really shot himself in the foot with this one. A fantastic premise ruined by boring characters, silly sub-plots, and inane observations.This book feels like something turned in to fulfill a contract. There is a chase scene that goes on....and on.....and on.....for something like 100 pages. And rather than creating supense, or concern for the characters dangerous predicament, you just wish they'd die and leave you alone.I won't ruin the plot for you, but just let me say that it's been a long time since I've read a book with so many inconsistencies and absurd solutions, not to mention the repeated use of 'deus ex machina' to save the day.If you worship at the shrine of premise, this may be worth a read. If you also need characters to care about, or even tolerate, give it a pass.",0
"A great and terrible book: There are very few books that I meet that I don't like, this would be the second one. It was terrible. I know the author was thrilled with her research about the period, but I thought it was lame. I'm not a huge history fanatic, but even I knew the basics about corsets and button hooks fot shoes. And I find the relationship with the gypsy absurd. I can't imagine no matter how ill behaved a young Victorian lady may have been she would have never allowed herself to fall in love with a gypsy.The parts in the story where they cross over were quite lacking in description. All I could sense was a white haze with your own character description choice plopped in, since there was none to reference.I found myself to like the description of the author more enjoyable than the book.",0
"Just an OK Side Scroller: Overall, this game is no more impressive than any other side-scroller... it gets annoying at times, since unlike most games, you get only 2 hearts instead of 3, meaning 2 hits, you're dead. Also, the characters vary too little... the NES Tiny Toons where all the characters were different is better than this game. However, one thing really fun in this game is the ""Whack-a-Monty"" mini-game. It is just so much fun trying to get as big a score as possible playing this game!",1

"It's really not that bad!: If you're looking for an in-depth intructional video, this is not it. Nor is it a high-impact cardio workout. I'd say that it's more for muscular tone & endurance (my arms were BURNING by the time the warmup was over!), and it's also pretty relaxing. The camera work was pretty bad, but not quite as abysmal as it's been made out to be. When you can't see the appropriate body part, it's often during repetitions of a move she's already shown you - if you have any kind of dance experience at all, it shouldn't throw you *too* much.As I said, if you want detailed instruction in proper belly dance technique, this is not the video for you. If, however, you want something fun and different to add to your exercise repertoire, you just might enjoy this.",1
"""Give me back me 16 dollars!!""--Eminem: Perfect use for Eminem's words. Pretty sad when the best song on the CD is a RIP off of the greatest rapper of all time (who HATED Jay Z) which isn't even that great of a song anyway. His career is over, not impressed. Save your money.",0

I'll tell ya': All those wondering what happened to the killer guitar work on her first album need to realize that that was not her playing, but a young and really soulful player by the name of Sean Costello. It was a great combination... if you're a blues fan, or a blues guitar fan in particular, you'd be better off getting Sean Costello's Moanin' for Molasses. That one's killer all the way through. In my alternate universe he's the big star...",0
"Just right: The product is just right for an 8 year old. Should last at least a year depending upon his growth. My 10 year old got one as well but considering he is smaller than the 8 year old, it works. 15Mph does last quite a bit of time before it needs to be recharged. Both kids are 80 pounds or so. The product is perfect for those who can't make the jump yet to the gas Pocket Rockets.",1
"GREAT IDEAS FOR THE SERIOUS MARKETER: I have to disagree with the negative review of this book. The fact is, it's written for financial advisors who are READY to spend thousands of dollars on marketing their practice, because that's what it takes to build a business.

DO NOT BUY -- see class action lawsuit re: defects: Nearly cried when this TV developed a nasty series of blue blobs on the screen after only 2 years. Learned late that the optic block was known to be defective by Sony but they sold this model anyhow. A class-action lawsuit is pending. The optic block is so expensive and expensive to install that it would cost more than the TV is now worth.DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. READ the internet re: all the complaints and the pending lawsuit. Never again will I buy a Sony.,0
DO NOT BUY - MISLEADING: In the description it clearly states 6 mascaras - I wish I would have read the reviews before ordering because you only receive one - It costs more money by ordering it this way than if I would have went to my local store and purchased it.

"Nice workout: I really enjoyed having Lindsay Brin's workout during my second and third trimester. My sis, who was due two weeks before me, found it in her local library, and told me how much she liked it. It can be hard finding a workout that is specially designed for prego moms, so I was happy to hear of a good one! I ordered it, and was more than pleased with the actual workout when it arrived.

"A close to definitive Best Of collection: This MCA import-only release represents Kitt's output on the Kapp label during the late 50's/early 60's.

Definitely worth the investment!",1

Stopped using it after that, but unfortunately didn't throw it out. Yesterday changed the water in two pleco tanks and didn't have my usual Novaqua, so I used the Amquel Plus. Big mistake, all the plecos in one tank died within hours, and half of those in the other tank are dead too. So the only common item in the three deaths is using the Amquel. Don't know if it went bad or something, it really stank and the tank water still stinks. So I just don't trust it any more.",0
"What an awful pick for #1: Any true Beasties fan will tell you that Paul's Boutique is their best album. Check Your Head is better if you want to hear the Beasties' musicianship.

"Something is different (and wrong): I've been ordering this bulk pack off Amazon for probably 5 years or so. I actually preferred this tissue to regular tissue (maybe because i have to change the roll less and feel like i'm wasting less and it was reasonably soft and seemed to be good for getting the right amount).Something has all of a sudden changed. It is actually rough now and hard to handle (it used to be soft despite what all the haters said). I literally can't touch it it feels so rough. I have been using it and although it's function to some extent it's highly undesirable. I had a big pack of these and someone thought i had ordered it by mistake (since single ply cheap tissue) and put it in the trash and i laughed at them and said why would I waste perfectly good toilet paper. Now the ""New Look"" one IS actually going in the trash (or return, i'll see if I can despite using a couple rolls).",0

"A WONDERFUL OVERVIEW OF EVERYDAY LIFE IN NEW KINGDOM EGYPT: For anyone interested in knowing how was it like to live under the rule of the great New Kingdom Pharaohs of Egypt, this is the book. With grace and elegant style, Dr. James gifted us with a wonderful overview of everyday life taking as evidence the registers from tomb and temple wallpaintings and inscriptions, from which he has taken nice and amusing ""bites of reality"". There are texts from private and official letters and bussiness-documents; everything was masterly handed by the great British Egyptologist, so as to let us recover a lively glimpse of ancient Egyptians and their way-of-life in those golden ages.",1

Thoman E. Mails, the author, acts as a mouth piece for Dan Evehema, a 102 year old Hopi elder. The two relate a brief but through understanding of the Hopi including a current and ongoing conflict within the tribe, a conflict with ""global"" significance. Dan Evehema has a story to tell, one that will really grab you, that will sound familiar, and true, one that you may even feel a part of. A story that may oneday save your life as well as give you spiritual strength. Contains: Christian/Biblical similar stories from Genisis to the book of Revelation. You'll say ""wow"" a lot.",1
"Buy some mini-speakers instead: I read all the technical information on this product, but I should have waited to read these customer reviews! The product does not work in the LA/Orange County area; there is too much interference from other radio stations. The customer service rep at The Gig Store (the vendor of this product) told me that they have had many returns because of the interference problem and they don't intend to market it to urban areas!I am extremely disappointed in the product and would not recommend it.

Paris je ne t'aime pas - not this version anyway: We went to set-up and selected audio english sterio - but after numerous tries only got french - this film apparently does not have an alternative sound track in English. We then selected subtitles in English - the subtitles were geared more to deaf people than those who don't understand french - with non verbal sounds described.The film itself is a series of brief inconclusive vignettes - with poor and incomplete story lines and no great acting from the outstanding cast.The disc was poor - the picture broke up several times and - at one stage - we had to stop the disc and restart it a bit further along.Apparently the film was acclaimed at the Toronto and Cannes festivals and by the New York Times - which should have been sufficient warning. No doubt it also went down well in Trois Rivieres and Chicoutimi!Our advice - if you want to get all sentimental about Paris - try A Tale of Two Cities - you'll cry your head off,0
"Miss the good old days: Simply put, this book is not good. Anyone looking for quality BP stories should buy the trades written by Priest.

"Excellent Easy Day Hikes in the Santa Fe area: This hiking guide was all we needed for my family and I to enjoy lovely and easy day hikes in the Santa fe area.

The hikes included in this book were excellent selections of the various choices available to the santa fe day explorer. Thank you Linda and Katherine for such good information and suggestions!",1
"not bad for the price: Have only used for about a month, however seems to work just fine in all operations. Probably need to fine tune my use but as I get acquaited with the Oster I am sure the quality of what I use it for will be better. Lot of frozen products do not give use for a toaster oven except when to tell you not to use one. I use it more then heating up a large oven for such items as a single biscuit, pocket snacks, broil fish and such. Handy little item. I recommend this item if looking for a toaster oven.",1
"As Funny as a Chick Tract, perfect for smug self-satisfied loosers: If you are a fuming democrat or liberal, and if obvious substitutional humor tickles your funny bone, then this is the book for you. An example of what is on offer here: the cover features a cartoon of George W. Bush, caricatured as a gorilla, in a head shot pose of Rodin's ""The Thinker.""Yuck yuck yuck!Stay tuned for my own edition on former President Clinton modeled on author David Martin's guidelines. The cover will feature a picture of Clinton modeled on the Pompeiian House of the Vettii's portrait of Priapus weighing his prodigous member.As Jack Chick would say, ""Haw-Hawwwwwww.""",0
this cd is shure to rock the pants off all pj fans so buy it: Eddie Vedder is probably the best live rock singer of our time. 5 albums of great songs is condensed into this cd + a track that could only be picked up as a legal mp3. This will put a slight hault on the bootlegging market which is so numerous yet legal because Pearl Jam allows rrecording of live material and distribution over the internet. Since these songs will have been professionally edited they will sound much better than the same songs live that i have.,1

"It's all relative: Hey, this ain't the Beatles. The Fourmost established their reputation as a tight, exciting act in Liverpool alongside the Beatles, incorporating a cabaret-styled humor in their act BEFORE they were forced to go cabaret. They relied totally on outside material, and certainly didn't know how to cope when Merseybeat ended by the end of '65.What they are is good example of prime Merseybeat, even on a goofy tune like Girls, Girls, Girls. The Beatles did much the same thing with Searchin' early in their career (though, unlike the Fourmost, they didn't actually release it on record, though they did commit it to tape at their Jan, '62 Decca audition). If you buy prudently, this disc is under $10.00, including shipping. There are enough good songs, IMO, to justify the price, and, at 33 songs, you certainly can't say the record company was stingy.If you like Merseybeat and aren't expecting the Beatles, you'll be pleased with this disc.",1

"Don't Buy This DVD!: Do not buy this! It is an exact copy of one of the dvd's that comes in the Eminem""The DVD Collector's Box. They rewrapp the dvd and sell it as if it is another documentary. Additionally, it is not authorized by Eminem. It has Uncle Tom in it spewing untruths about Eminem. There are no voices that represent Eminem. There are some remarks by Eminmen all pulled from one interview. Any true Eminem fan or person looking for the truth about the rapper should not buy this DVD!",0
I hope the bottom does not fall out: I am very disappointed with this grill. After it taking forever to put together....I was impressed with the look BUT after I BBQ for the family for Easter the paint has started to peel off the bottom of the grill. I have never experienced this with any grills and I purchase a new grill every year. I would advise another brand name and staying away from the cheaply made Meco Series. If the bottom falls out I will be returning it because I paid way too much for this grill for it to look ugly after the first use. Very disappointed...especially during a Holiday,0
"This is a joke: Not only did we spend the cost to purchase this product but another $40.00 to send things off to be tested for mold and mold spores and the report came back and didn't say a dam thing, we had a mold speciality company read the report and they told us they didn't really say anything important in the report because there was no testing done for the air quality coming in or going out of the home.",0
"Garmin c340: Excellent choice. I was confused when first deciding on a street pilot for my husband. He is very fussy and it was a big deal to choose the best product for the money. I am so glad I chose the c340. It had all the features that I knew would interest my husband. Some of the street pilots only say turn left or turn right without announcing the name of the road. This little unit does everything. It does not have an mp3 player, but didn't want one. That is why I chose this model. Also I purchased the tripold weighted mount, because I read other reviews where the one that fastened to the windshield had fallen after hitting bumps. So I didn't want to take that chance and purchased the extra mount. I would recommend this model to anyone shopping for a street piolot or GPS.It was his best Christmas present. Eileen",1
"Gielgud loved it...now why can't we have it?: John Gielgud stated that his performance in ""Providence"" was the best movie performance of his life. I wouldn't argue with that. A superb cast includes Ellen Burstyn, Dirk Bogarde, and David Warner. The film attempts to show the world through one querulous, dying novelist, and then the world as it really is. Many films have dived into the creative process, but this one succeeds brilliantly. I'm writing Criterion to ask if they could put this on their release schedule. There are so many awful films that have been released on DVD--why this one remains unshown is beyond me.",1

"Poignant Insights: The ancient observer's insights have stood the test of time. Some elements of human nature remain consistent regardless of the century or technology. Aristotle thought classification was important. In this work he sets forth a taxonomy for poetics. One of the more controversial statements he makes in this book is ""poetry is both more philosophical and more serious than history."" He doesn't leave it at that, being the philosopher he is he goes on to explain himsself. He adds, ""poetry speaks more of what is universally the case, whereas history speaks of particular events."" This book will give you a comparison that spans cultures and centuries.",1

"The new management imperative in finance by James T. Gleason: The author provides an excellent overview of the development of risk management products and best practices since the early 1980s. The book also covers the latest developments taking place in counterparty risk measurement and the move beyond relying on value-at-risk models only towards 'stress testing'. In the final chapters of the book, the author provides a roadmap for developing an enterprise wide risk management framework and some of the pitfalls that may be encountered in its implementation. The book is clearly written by someone with practical experience of the subject matter and, unlike many other books in the field, explains the issues without reverting to complex mathematics and statistics.",1

It started freezing up, and then yesterday I returned to find a router that does not work.I have now spent 12+ hours and talked to 6 expert techs that have no idea how to fix this problem. Most of the ""experts"" are less skilled in computer networking than I am and I am a film director. Additionally, the software does not fire correctly, and once on the wrong path is not recoverable.Therefore, I would be very weary of jumping in. When it works, it is beautiful, but when it crashes you are abandoned and without support or help.... Make your decision.",0
"Useless: This book is basically just a long list of platitudes, like ""strive for excellence"", ""plan ahead"" and ""be nice to people"". It contains very little of substance and is incredibly superficial.Apart from that, it is poorly organised (apparently every single paragraf deserves to get its own header!), extremely repetitive, and also contains annoying small mistakes (like referring to a reading list which doesn't exist).",0

"A Waste of Money - <1 Star: This book looks just like a compilation of the ""author's"" position trading books but with editing to put in the words ""day trading"" where ""position trading"" used to be. There's no other difference. The only potentially useful info to a newbie was about monitoring the first 30 minutes to try to determine the direction of the day. However, everyone has been doing that for years and most websites suggest it, without charging. Who doesn't know what an oscillator divergence is? That's not a system and while a valid indicator for some trading styles, is certainly not unique to day trading.

"The first few chapters were mesmerizing: I read it six years ago and haven't read it since, although I would like to again. The most I remember about the book was its first few chapters, on the murder of the Clutter family. How Nancy's friend ran out screaming, ""Nancy's dead!"" About Nancy's stuffed bear. How the teacher who entered the Clutter house and recognized Kenyon even though he had been shot in the face. All of these were hauntingly descriptive. The second half was about the trials, but I was more hooked on the first half. Even though it happened more than 40 years ago, I know the Clutter family are at peace and so are the people who knew the family when they were young. The Cold War ended, Vietnam came and went, techonological revolution took place, but the story of the Holcomb murders will never be altered.",1
"Poor implementation for report dictation: If you record something for transcription on the DS-2, you cannot review it and then pick up again.

Sometimes I make dictation mistakes, realize I have, rewind a bit and then record over the mistakes and continue.With the DS-2 one can only record a file. If one wants to listen to the file, the file is closed to dictation. One cannot correct mistakes. This makes the unit nigh useless for me.I think I'm going to offer it up on Ebay.",0

"Perfect Pushup the perfect workout: I am always a little skeptical of new training equipment. They seem to over promise and under deliver. Some products do this more than others. The ones that completely under deliver I send back. The Perfect Push up doesn't fall into either of these categories. It is exactly what they said it would be. The first time I used it I felt a huge difference in my chest, shoulders, triceps and abs (particularly my obloquies). I use it almost everyday and have felt in just 3 short weeks a measurable difference in my strength. I have recommended this to my friends which I never do.The only thing I wish they included was a more in-depth workout plan.Other than that it is a great product.",1

The graphics are wonderful, even on lower settings.I've found I get the most fun out of this game when I play it with a group of friends on a LAN. The game really lends itself to this sort of venue. The online community is also good, but a little tough to crack into if your a begginer.Another thing that made me like this game was the fact that, while gripping, it never pretends to be real. It is a game inside a game. This greatly increases my enjoyment.All in all, highly reccomended.",1

When the copy i bought from the Amazon merchant arrived, I tried to return it, but I could not find a return address anywhere. I sent the merchant an e'mail asking for a return address four days ago, but I have still not recieved an address.

It truly is the WORST movie ever made and the Rifftrax gang makes it even MORE funny than it was never intended (by the original Director, Writer, Producer, Cinematographer hmmm... did I leave anything out Mr. Ed.

I highly recommend that anybody who needs an MSK3K style laugh pick up this movie and watch it but don't get too overly cerebral with it because these guys who did the original don't have two working brain cells to rub together if you know what I mean (as evidenced by the lead headlining dead guy Bela, again nuff said).

"Worst Christmas Movie Ever: Bought the movie thinking it would be interesting for our four year old. The movie was terrible! The premise was awful, the notion of wolves eating reindeer not really great for kids movie. There was no humor, and no redeeming story. In fact, the notion the ""Daddy"" reindeer flew in to town and spent one night with the ""Mommy"" reindeer, and then left to never see his unborn son again is not necessarily a good theme. Finally, a purple poodle appearing in the middle of the North Pole. I recognize that snowmen can come to life, but at least make the premise plausible.

The best break dance instructional video: I thought this video was very helpful and awsome. It boosted my energy and strength. Before I had the video i could hardly dance.

It's da bomb--literally and figuratively!!!: There is no game on the XBox platform that is as engaging and challenging as Madden 2003.

Exposing the wolves: Found this an extremely helpful book. It exposed the strategies used by manipulators and the way that they can present. Knowing some of this will hopefully help me protect myself from future harm in my personal and work life. Should be compulsory reading.,1
"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!: Did I mention that this movie was terrible? Cheesy clunky script, idiotic premise, bad acting, unbelievable sets (except for the ones on the actual Unicorn). And since when does a fairy have vampire teeth? Really, I would avoid this movie and get some of the Hallmark miniseries. Much better quality!",0

"Carry me to the stars...: I'm not one who falls in love with a song right away...it takes me several listenings before I really get into it...not with ""Drops of Jupiter.""...I clicked onto MTV one day, and Train's video for this song came on....instantly hooked...mesmorized....I asked for the CD for Christmas, and cannot wait to jam that song in my car, moon-roof open, driving past the sea............my new theme song.......",1

"An incoherent mess: Despite the fact that the little bit of plot that's here is pretty simple, Reiji Saiga's poor writing, awkward pacing, and dreadful layouts make it almost impossible to follow. Things seem to constantly happen for no reason to bland, cliched characters. And if you're hoping that it at least has decent action, it's almost impossible to figure out what's going on in the fights, which are brief and usually only finish with only one character ever making contact with the other. This is up there with Bomber Girl as one of the most dreadful manga series ever translated into English. Avoid.",0
"For the eager listener, this is a miracle: If you're willing to listen and imagine the time, place and circumstance of this recording, its as remarkable a musical thing can be. This very modest voice coming out of what must seemed an Old testament plague, to tell us stories, sing us a simple song. It is almost like the world was starting again, with its uniquely American voice to piece itself back together, without the trappings of history beyond the memories of this man and his companions. Pretty damn beautiful, Woody.",1

"In Love: I don't know what any of you all are talking about saying this is a no good album and don't waste money on it. It ROCKS. I had doubts at first, being a HUGE STP fan, and absolutely HATING GNR!! I didn't like the album at first because it had too much of the guitar sound from GNR, but I finally just sort of tuned that part out and Scott's voice is heavenly! Also, for all of you who can't get this album to work on your Ipods - get a different MP3 player, because it ripped just fine on my comp and plays great on my MP3 player! no probs. Love you VR!!",1
"Total ripoff: This is a piece of fluff, worth about 5 cents. I clicked on it, thinking it was a bargain cd. It was -- for amazon.",0
"Not one of his best...: I'm a huge Roald Dahl fan, but I found this to be one of his weakest books; in essence, it teaches ""If someone isn't nice, it's okay to steal from him."" In addition, the story seemed rather uninspired; though the relationship with Danny and his father was touching, it seemed to wrap itself around a metaphor of dubious origin; father and son bonding over stealing & killing. I'd suggest the superior ""The Enormous Crocodile"" , or the quintissential ""james and the giant peach"", ""matilda"", or ""witches"" (my personal favorite) over this questionable entry.",0
"Waterproof Case makes Underwater pics Crystal Clear: I had hoped to be able to take some great pics with the underwater housing, but am stunned by just how good it is. The detail in the pictures is crystal clear. It allows you to use every function of the camera. It also means you can film underwater, and the sound is very clear. It was a great investment to compliment a fantastic camera",1

It will protect golf clubs for a long long time.This case is big enough to hold a complete set of golf clubs in the bag, with a couple extra drivers, and shoes too.Overall I'm happy with my purchase. If anyone at the airport asks what's in the case, I'll make up a story about how I just got back from raiding the tomb of a 5000 year old mummy.",1
"Rating and a rant: This was a great deal! The amount of olives seems overwhelming at first glance but quickly dwindles after some divvying up with friends and a few parties. One of the varieties of olive did become mushy upon refrigeration but the others held their firmness. Now, I myself can't purchase them again because Amazon has declined to ship groceries to Alaska any longer. I really cant fathom why some companies choose to treat both Alaska & Hawaii as though we are located on another planet. If you are shipping from the west coast, it is the same amount to ship to either Alaska or the east coast. How 'bout cutting off New jersey's olive supply? I digress....buy the olives, have some for me.",1
"Be prepared to do the prep: This book came highly recommended from a friend who is still making his way through it. These are complicated recipes that are not for the novice, and a lot of them require that you have several other recipes in the book (stocks, spice mixes, oils) prepared ahead of time, but when you do get it all together you and your fellow guests will be raving about the dishes. Oh my my my.Most importantly, the book will teach you how to make your own versions of the sauces and oils that up till now you've been buying in supermarkets. And when you taste the difference you'll never go back. And that's all in the very important first chapter. With used copies going for a ridiculous $1.99, you could buy the book just for that.On top of that, Tropp writes in an entertaining, chatty, and informative way that makes the book a pleasure to read even if you're not going to cook.",1
Cant wait for book 3!: I read the ending to the revised book. Thank you Wahida for fixing this and I am glad that Trey is going to make it. Can't wait for Thug Matrimony.,1

"Great, in theory: First of all, I am a huge Bill Simmons fan. I am also a fan of all the local Boston teams (even though I wasn't born in Boston). So, in theory, this should mix into a great book.I started out liking it and eventually tossed it in a corner in disgust. Mainly due to my own stupidity in buying it.Here's the premise. Write a bunch of articles on a website. A few years down the road, slightly edit them, add four hundred footnotes (most of which have also already been published), and sell book.So...here's the rundown1) Old Articles2) Mostly old footnotes3) Footnotes that are hard to read (I don't wear glasses by the way)4) Notice how many times Bill repeats himself when you read the articles back to back.Like I said, I look forward to Bill every week. Love the Sox and really thought this book would end up in my ""keep"" pile. Instead I hope I can get $5 at the local used bookstore and feel like I got suckered.",0

"The undermining of the Catholic Church: This book is important reading for Catholics who take the practice of their Faith seriously. Time and again, during recent years, we have seen purportedly ""Catholic"" authorities, speaking through the media, contradicting beliefs universally taught pre-Vatican II.Has the Church changed so radically? Is what was once wrong, wrong no longer? Does it matter if the formal liturgy of the Mass is changed by the Celebrant? Why?Cecilia Martin documents many abuses, justified by their proponents as ""reform,"" currently assailing the Church. She shows how enemies hijacked the genuine reforms of Vatican II and selectively misinterpreted them to promote an agenda aimed at its destruction. Far fetched? Read the book! It is well written and referenced. Reach your own conclusions. If they are the same as Cecilia's, follow her advice on how to counteract this attack from within.",1

We considered moving it to her account but then she saw my library and decided that she would just rather read the books I had purchased so I left it on my account. We find this one of the best features of this system - both of us able to read the same books.

Thanks for such a great product and system.",1

"This is not the ENVY from Japan: I bought this CD here on Amazon thinking it was a CD from the semi-Mogwai-related (they are on their label in Europe) Japanese band Envy. What I got was a truly awful goth-emo-whine album. Please avoid at all costs if you are looking for the Japanese band. Somehow, this record has received great reviews from others, but I smell a rat. The album is truly abysmal.",0

"Excellent game!: This game is absolutely brilliant!As promised by Konami this game shows PS3 capabilities at its best.The game has a fantastic storyline, amazing graphics, great attention to detail, great sound and a bunch of gadgets and different weapons to keep you busy shooting for a while.I think that this game is only intended for experienced gamers in this genre as controls are a little hard to get used to for some people as Ive seen and same with the tactics to achieve your goals. Also it requires serious time to get the most of it, casual gamers should be better playing a single soccer match of PES or a race or two with gran turismo 5. Don`t even waste your time trying this game out if you don`t own it or you ain`t planning to get it cause the cut scenes are very very long. The game requires full attention and several hours to be played.If you like warfare/spying games this is the best title out there hands down.",1
"One of R&B's Finest - Yet Vastly Underrated: I've followed this guy since his very first single - ""I Am Somebody"". He's only gotten better with time. His voice is silky smooth and his range is extraordinary.Unfortunately, he never ""nailed"" the crossover success that was afforded to the likes of Luther Vandross, Peabo Bryson and Jeffery Osborne. However, his talents and skills are most certainly in the same league.If you've never checked out his work - this CD is a wonderful introduction to one of R&B;'s best kept secrets.",1

"Keeps going and going and going: What a great CD. It continually finds its way into my cd player even after 8 years in the rotation. I think back the the other CDs I bought in 1995, and few of them have withstood the test of time (Radiohead's The Bends being the major exception).If you have never heard of this band, give them a chance and you may be surprised. I'm only sad that the band never reached it potential.From Pop to Punk, the disc covers a lot of musical ground.",1
"She sucks!: Well, for me it's not so much that she is ""bad singer"" (I am not a music expert neither) - but she just seems to lack what is for me one of the more important things in the showbuisness actually : the individuality.Everything about her is so fake, commercial and primitive - she try so muuuch to be someone else that she is to please and be ""so damn cool"" lol .. she just make me pitty to look at and listen to her ..sorry but not!(And ..no it's not a comment of a fat girl with 7 childs lol ...but one of an actress and model unfortunatly .. and apart of this one who really enjoy looking at beautifull women.. tell me about someone like Penelope Cruz or Carre Otis, but Miss ""L.Jo"" ??

"Works Great. Solid Construction. Easy Storage.: This is my first panini maker but so far turns out to be exactly what I had hoped for.Pros:1) Solid Construction2) Nice lock for folded storage. Sits upright in our kitchen cabinet.3) Nice grill marks (I use olive oil on the outside of the bread.)Cons:1) As with all these types of small appliances, if someone could invent a removable grill section, it would make it much easier to wash. As is you just have to be careful when washing so as to not flood the sensative areas.2) I want to eat Panini's every meal.Would give it 5 stars if it would just have removable grills to make it easier to clean.",1

"Excellent: I bought this juicer for myself as a Christmas present last year and it has done a fantastic job this year introducing me into the world of juicing! The filter is made of a fine mesh and works great at removing chunks. I enjoy playing around with fruit and vegetable combinations. Cleaning it is similar to cleaning a food processor with the addition of the filter and spout. I find myself paying particular attention to these two spots, as food tends to collect there. Overall, I think it's an excellent juicer and highly recommend it to others.",1
"Funny, date movie material: Taken at face value, this film is fairly funny, but a romantic comedy, one of those good date movies. Now from a guys perspective, what the heck, Just so out landish, and not in a million years, and I can't give a woman's perspective, but I expect his dorm speach would probably end with laughter and future future torture by guys and eventual transfer. So, shutting of the brain is good for some of the story. But otherwise Not bad. A young man at college gets lucky after a party at the girls dorm with the mystery girl in the stalled/dark elevator. He spend the whole school year looking for her, and contrives a plan to work his way into the dorm. Anyhow, will he figure out on his adventures to the dorm who this girl is, or will he end up with his heart empty. Worth a watch, not bad for the collection (in the box in the dark corner of the closet marked ""chick flix"")",1

As soon as this stuff was exposed to water it came off rather easily. It goes on white and is clear once it's dry.

At least it's easy to remove",0

"Way behind the times!: Read the other reviews to get a good idea of what you will be dealing with. It is definitely buggy...even with updates. I firmly believe a game should be fully functional out of the box. This game requires and will continue to require updates and patches. I have a pre-release copy becauseI was a beta tester. I have played the retail release version for over 3 weeks.Forget this game and go buy Elder Scrolls: Oblivion!!!To be honest, if you want the best of both FPS and RPG environments...skip this game. The graphics are outdated, the concept is outdated and the inventory management system is horrible. Just wait till you have 2 or 3 characters to manage!!!! UTTERLY FRUSTRATING and TIME CONSUMING!!If you like clicking around with your mouse all day....you could just cruise websites...it won't cost you a dime...or you could play this game!Pass it over, especially if you played the first NWN game. Not much new folks.Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is still the GOLD STANDARD!",0
"An American Quilt: A seminal movie in American film history, this shows Altman at his early, novelistic best. Sets of characters come and go, cross paths then recross. From the airport, to the Grand Ole Opry, to the Parthenon, Altmans' ablility to see the individual in the grand scheme of the vast American landscape is beautifully evidenced in this picture. A Bittersweet Love Song to American Country Music.",1

"Rich, textured sound, awesome tracks: This is one of the most awesome CDs I've ever heard. The vocals are rich, throaty, intimate and strong simultaneously, and the lyrics are haunting and moving. The kind you sing over to yourself and don't even realize you're singing until the force of the words just hits you. From the melancholy and understated simplicity of ""JT Interlude"" to the throbbing rock guitar on ""She Said,"" the entire CD is a fluid range of everything good in indie rock. This CD is part of the human experience.",1

What the heck?: So when does a movie stop in the middle and leave you with no closure? When you watch Onegin! It's really slow at the get go and then when you think the movie it finally going to pick up and get good it stops! And stops with no real conclusion as to what's going to happen to all involved! I did not like this movie one bit! I was highly disappointed and would recommend that people see anything else.,0

"A wonderful book for young and beginning artists!: Finally a book that outlines techniques, tools, the artists environment and everything in between. The premise of the book is that we are not given the proper tools to excel as artists. Given the proper tools and instruction, anyone can greatly improve their drawing capability. I look forward to using the methods outlined in this book to assist my 6 year old aspiring artist in developing her talent. This is a wonderful book.",1

"Poor Research: Reading this book was quite painful. Sean Hannity's writing is terrible and he uses the word ""evil"" way too much. He lacks an understanding of history. Hannity generally distorts historical events to suit his point of view. The main problem I have with his book is the research. It's obvious he didn't research his book correctly. He lacks primary sources, and the ones he uses are limited to memoirs. If he had used more government documents he likely would have found his own beliefs to be challenged. As a college student I can tell you that if I had written this I would fail for having done such a bad job on my research. Don't read this, it's not worth it, and if you aren't polished on your history definitely don't read it. This book is so inaccurate it hurts. I read this junk after reading Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and The Last Man, so it was like going from Foreign Affairs to People Magazine. Put that one into your dome scope...",0

"Zero Stars -- Do not buy this book!: Well, Stuart Woods has already proven he can write. Too bad he doesn't try to write in this book. It has all the hallmarks of being tossed off in fulfillment of a multi-book contract. One wonders, nevertheless, how any self-respecting editor could have passed on it.The book is a piece of garbage. It's not worth even a dollar. I read it because I paid for it, but as I've done with many paperbacks I should've just quit reading and tossed it after 30 pages.For anyone who has admired Stuart Woods past productions this project will be a profound disappointment.I should have paid more attention to the Kirkus review, which is on the mark.Do not, repeat not, buy this book!!!",0
"This is a well thought out review: I have many many points to illustrate to discuss my displeasure in this feature film.1. It is not goodIn not good I'm specifically speaking about the content, design, and follow through of the picture.2. It wasted my time.In the time I spent watching this movie I could have been doing any number of things. From Botany to small home repairs. I could EVEN have watched something good (which this was not)3. It had a big budget for no reason.The actors, stage crew, all the way down to the film stock used for this film could have been better served with any number of better projects (even romantic comedies)If pressed I'm certain I can find more things I disliked about this movie.",0

"A Voice of an Angel: This is an excellent CD for the new Nat ""King"" Cole fans that want a true representation of his vocal technique on various tracks with both a Big Band, and a large string section. My favorites on this CD are ""When I Fall In Love"" (I think Karen Carpenter's version and N.K. Cole's are the best recordings of all time), ""Once In A While"", and ""These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)"" (Cabaret singer Andrea Marcovicci, has the best female version of this song). What a beautiful and expressive male voice! Except for living legend Tony Bennett, they sure don't make singers like the Nat ""King"" Cole anymore. I think we only have a handful of contemporary American crooners, like Harry Connick, Jr., Barry Manilow, and West Coast based new 'cabaret-pop' sensation Michael Poss, to vocally express unique interpretations of the ""Great Standards"". This is an excellent CD! Order it now from Amazon.com.",1
"BIG ACTION FILMS SELDOM PROBE CHARACTER AND MOTIVATION; BUT THIS ONE DOES.: With all the great battle scenes it was a feat of writing and editing to so sharply etch the characters in such a multilevel, realistic human way. Exciting, well-choreographed action and deep, dimensional characterization equals a great historical drama.Everything worked. Great art direction, costumes and rich production details mean that Hollywood should grow past its box-office-driven big star movies like Troy and Alexander, depending on CGI tricks alone, because China films are a-coming. See this fine movie and see what I mean.",1

If your munchkin produces more than that...blowout. I've never had urine leak from these. I tried getting the cheaper ""big-box"" diapers but a percentage of those were unusable due to manufacturing defects. These are more expensive, but every one is usable.

Delightful story: Sky rider is a beautifully illustrated and encouraging book for children of all ages. I loved the dragon and Del and the lessons they can teach all of us.,1
"Yet Another Positive Review: I'd rate this somewhere between a 4 and 5. I read this book before a recent trip to Australia and found Mr. Bryson's comments about both the country and the people to be right on the mark. Additionally he has a great sense of humor. I saw Australians reading the book, perhaps the ultimate endorsement. Althought I only went to major cities, Mr. Bryson made me want to go deep into the continent. A great read.",1

"Sorry, I love Los Straitjackets, but this is not up to par: While there are a few well-performed XMAS tunes here, this CD lacks ""sparks"". There is nothing that is remarkably well done, and there are a few tunes that are rather poorly arranged and delivered without passion.Some tunes imitate the style and delivery of the Ventures Christmas Album. That disk is a truly excellent collection. But the Ventures just did it better. Los Straitjackets are a great group. I own all their CDs, but this CD is less than what they are capable of.",0
good product: My dermatologist suggested this product to me after I had an allergic reaction to a medication and broke out with an itchy rash. I still have itchy skin so I though I would look for this online. The product seems to work well even though some of the ingredients are not exactly the same. The price was no different than purchasing it through my dermatologist however so I think I will save on shipping next time and just pick it up at the doctors office.,1
"Revealing hoaxsters and raising doubts about others...: The author presents an interesting collection of well documented essays (and a few historical photographs) that intrigue and educate the reader about some of the greatest adventurer and discovery hoaxes over the centuries.

Did Hannibal really cross the Alps? Was it Tenzig Norgay first to summit on Everest or was it Hillary? If Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon, who took the famous picture of him descending from the space capsule planting a foot firmly onto Moon soil? This book can get you thinking.",1
Nem sempre é possível repetir a dose: The Lost World - O Mundo Perdido - segue-se ao Jurassic Park. Deixando de lado o aspecto tecnológico no sobra nada na fita. As duas estrelas so atribuídas exclusivamente pela tecnologia empregada. Nada mais.,0
"The ONLY Life on Mars worth seeing: I second the previous reviews stating that the UK version of Life on Mars is infinitely superior to the American remake. It's really very sad and funny, both, to see what a lackluster job ABC did.The UK version, i.e. the original, is truly a masterpiece. Buy it (at any price), and watch it in peace and quiet with the best quality A/V setup you can manage. You will not be disappointed.For the record, I'm an American, and I had to create my own sort of British slang glossary as I went along. For me, this was half the fun. (The fabulously obscene Gene Hunt was the other half.)Buy it. ~~~ Buy it. ~~~ Buy it.",1
"Cheaply-made volume: I bought this volume because several of the reviews mentioned that there were illustrations by John Tenniel. Unfortunately I failed to read the small print: keep in mind that most of the reviews posted to this edition refer to other editions. The edition I bought was the CreateSpace paperback with the pink and white cover.This particular edition has NO illustrations. It is also cheaply made -- the cover is flimsy and the binding is poor. Finally, the quotation-marks printed in this book are all straight, not curved -- as if it were typed up and printed from Wordpad.I was not satisfied with this volume. There are other volumes that cost less and are of much higher quality, for example:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)",0
"Read This Before U Buy: In 2005, the EPA canceled permission to use phenothrin in several flea and tick products, at the request of the manufacturer, Hartz Mountain Industries.[1][2] The products were linked to a range of adverse reactions, including hair loss, salivation, tremors, and numerous deaths in cats and kittens. In the short term, the agreement called for new warning labels on the products.As of March 31, 2006, the sale and distribution of Hartz's phenothrin-containing flea and tick products for cats has been terminated. However, EPA's product cancellation order did not apply to Hartz flea and tick products for dogs, and Hartz continues to use phenothrin in a concentration of 85.7% in many of its flea and tick products for dogs.[3]I bought this as a quick solution, and thank heavens I read reviews before applying to my beautiful Yorkie. <3",0
"Gentlemen (and ladies), start your food pros!: I borrowed this book from my local library and tried 3 recipes (rice and lentil; pumpkin seed and squash; mushroom). The patties all turned out delicious and had excellent texture -- and each kind had a different flavour. The author has obviously tried each recipe and tweaked them to perfection.It does take a little time to put a recipe together, and it's best if you own a food pro, but the recipes will yield 9-12 patties, enough for a few meals. If you are a vegetarian already, some of your usual leftovers can be used as well.Rounded out with greens and all the fixins, these patties make for lowfat, healthy and tasty meals.",1
"totally satisfied: this is a very good book, directly they speak about the topic with good tutorials. most books has unwanted stuff, but this is a very small book with so much to learn. i think this is a very good book for the people who new to this subject and for the one who want to start it.",1
Dissapointment: To predictable. I could have written a much better script. The acting wasn't bad though. All four people that watched this with us had the same opinion.,0
"I know what I want - and the Boys give it every time!: I just got the UK 12"" single - after listening several times, I can tell you the song's not the greatest they've ever done (remember listening to the CD singles of ""Before,"" and wondering if you'd like the ""Bilingual"" album when it came out?) - but it's still very good. Who else can combine average lyrics with electronica and make a song that's danceable, sad, and full of meaning? The remixes are OK, but at least the lyrics are included in the Morales and Maddkatt remixes (the 12"" has 3 extras - Dub, Thee Drum Drum Mix, and Thee 2 Blak Ninja Remix - that are just drums and samples, no lyrics). Hearing this 12"" only whets my appetite for the CD singles - PSB's B-sides are always a treat! Not to mention the September single ""New York City Boy"" and the CD itself - ""Nightlife"" -due in October. If this song is any indication of what's on the new album, then Fall 1999 will be awesome for all PSB fans!",1
"Love the show, poor quality recordings/DVDs: I loved this show as a kid. I was excited to see it finally offered. However, it is a very poor quality set. The DVDs are not numbered, they are packaged in an odd way that stacks them against each other, there are no special features and worse part of the quality of the recordings. They are faded and sometimes a bit jumpy. All that beautiful scenery I remember is faded yellow/brown. Like watching a 20 year old VHS tape. I would love to see this digitally remastered. We'll watch them still - but would wait for a better version before buying any other seasons. I wouldn't recommend this set.",0
"Crashes when trying to view streaming video: This review applies to version 4 of the BEFW11S4 router. I do not know if older versions have the same issues or not. The latest firmware does not support streaming videos!!! Turns out, this is a very well known issue with this router in the on-line community. If you try to watch videos from web sites like cnn.com, roadandtrack, etc. the router will crash and have to be re-booted. The older firmware revisions did not have this problem. However, only the latest firmware revision correctly supports UPnP (a very usefull feature for file-sharing software). Linksys has not come out with a any new firmware version since middle of 2005 which really goes to show their commitment to customer support.",0
"Too many characters: Kress tries to pull off four main viewpoint characters in 400 pages and fails. She has a great opening hook, and then the Vegas showgirl we followed for the first 25 pages hardly gets mentioned. Then the reader is alternated between a ex-marine with a drinking problem who wants his kids back, an FBI investigator who is stalking his ex-wife, and the wife of a deceased researcher who just found out he was having an affair. Each of these four 'main' characters come with supporting casts of three to ten minor characters.On top of all that, Kress is trying to write a science fiction based mystery novel where the bad guys are the mob. Kress needed to pick one story and write it, instead of meandering.Too many disparate elements jammed together forced the cliches to bubble up to the top. Predictable end. More a dysfunctional screenplay than a novel.Honestly, the best thing about the book was the title. I think ""Oaths and Miracles"" is a wonderful title. Bad novel though; not recommended.",0
"It's ok.: This is an ok book, but it's a cheap take from ""The Wave"" when this story was originally written.",0
"distracted by plastic surgery: I never read the book nor did I know there was one. I actually checked this movie out from the library. The movie was actually boring and I was continually distracted by Heather Locklear's appearance. Unfortunately her plastic surgery makes her face appear swollen, distorted and ugly; i could not believe that this woman was once attractive; way too old to play this role in this very dull, uninteresting movie.",0
"A Pleasant Surprise: This is a wonderful debut album that really grows on you. My favorite tracks are Burn, Round Here, and When We're Apart. It's a very honest sounding record. Definitely worth a listen if you like folk or indie music.",1
Great book of inspiration!: I do not usually like abstract art yet I love the art in this book. Each page has an abstract picture with an affirmation. I would recommend this book to anyone and especially if you had a difficult childhood.,1
"Too brilliant: I bought this recording because Anne-Sophie Mutter's Autumn on her Meditation CD is so lovely -- but that version, as it turns out, was conducted by Von Karajan. The playing on this version is brilliant, but it's just too brilliant for me: the attack is so loud and aggressive that I couldn't settle down and enjoy the music nor even listen to the whole thing. The big lesson for me is to buy versions of her recordings in which she herself is not the conductor. I plan to donate this one to the local library and get the complete Von Karajan version. But in no way is this bad playing. It's just a matter of taste. If you like loud, flashy music, you will love this recording.",0
BEWARE!!!! This falls apart!: We got this cute trike for our toddler and it was falling apart 2 weeks after christmas. The handles totally come out of the base and it just crumbled to the crowd. We tightened it and everything a # of times and yet it still falls apart!!! BEWARE!!! this could be a safety recall issue.,0
"Unmannered yet moving performance.: Perhaps a tad slow in it's overall tempo, but nonetheless a moving performance. What other's may call lifeless I interpret it as Germanic protestant sobriety. Very well recorded.",1
"Very misleading image used for this product: I thought this was a good deal based upon the photo. Reality is you only get one of the items shown (the tube with a red ""12"" on it). Just a warning to anyone else that thinks they are getting everything pictured.",0
"Didn't I see this on 60 Minutes?: First of all, I like Sidney Sheldon books. I have read all of them. But the basis for the plot of this book was a segment I saw on 60 minutes over a year ago. Sidney, Sidney, Sidney -- we need some originality here... call me sometime and I know I can help you out with it.This book was fast-paced and fun... but there was no new ground explored here.I would recommend ""Master of the Game and If Tomorrow Comes"" as his best books.Perhaps I will re-read these, as they were original :)Ciao for now, Stetson",0
"HTC HSS-10 Heavy Duty Adjustable Roller Stand: HTC HSS-10 Heavy Duty Adjustable 26-Inch to 43-Inch Tall Roller Stand with 16-Inch Roller:This is a run-of-the-mill stand that lacks a fine adjustment that would make life in the shop so much easier. I thought the turn handle was a fine adjustment, but it's just a lock release. The four leg pedestal is hard to store as the legs are not movable. This is a disappointing purchase, and there are better brands available.",0
"full of holes: This would have been a fantastic winter toy for my 2 and 5 five year old children...but of course it was too good to be true. The first bouncer had three pinholes in the 2nd tier near the spears. Yes, amazon was helpful with the exchange but the same problem existed with the replacement but only in the third tier. Each time it was very hard to find the leaks... always around the seams. I would not reccomend this model unless they've improved the craftmanship around the seams. This item should only take 10-15 minutes to inflate wth the recommended electric pump. If it is taking longer start running your fingers around the seams feeling for the leaks. Good luck.",0
Looks very helpful!: Looks like it will give me a solid understanding of mason bees and how to use them in my garden.,1
Herzeleid takes Heavy Metal to another Level: If you own one album by Rammstein than you have to own the other to. Many bought Sehnsucht because of the popularity of Du Hast. Many found that the whole album is worth what ever you paid if not more. But You really need to go back to the store and Buy Herzleid it shows that these Germans are Taking Heavy Metal to the Next Level.,1
Great inspiration: This book give you wonderful inspiration for creating titles. The sizes are great for tracing and I love that each letter is shown in each theme so you don't have to figure letters out on your own.,1
"FUNNY,FUNNY MOVIE!: The opening armadillo scene is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time. This movie was a big hit with my hard to please 17 year old, as well as a variety of different ages of people. My only complaint is where the heck are those west Texas orange groves?",1
Works great: Exact same charger as my original charger that came with the RAZR. Works great. Would recommend to anyone.,1
"Wonderfully Written: I just saw this book here and HAD to review it. Just so you know, it has been probably 15 years since I have even SEEN this book. But I remember having read it over and over and over when I was in grade school. I think I read it because I had to the first time. Then I just picked it up and read it a few more times. It's that good.This is a book about a kid named Jimmy Carter, who loses his vision when his friend lights a firecracker and it explodes in his face.The book chronicles Jimmy's schooling at a school for the blind, and his relationship with Leader, his seeing eye dog. The book will also teach your children the value of forgiveness. It will also teach them that, while some things come easy to them, others have to struggle. What this book WON'T teach people is to pity blind poeple. Jimmy is by NO means a weak kid. When you finish reading ""Follow My Leader"" you will have a new respect for him.Buy it. It is one memorable book.",1
"Pretty good, cable organizer a nice touch: This is a pretty good hub, it has a cable organizer which is nice to keep things tidy around your workstation. It supplies power to devices like it should and hasn't stopped on me since I purchased it a month ago (I haven't turned it off). Occasionally I lose connection to my computer but I'm not sure if it's the fault of the hub or the cables I have.",1
Way too big: I have a a chihuahua mix. This was WAY too big. Won't be ordering from this company again. Luckily my neighbor has a boxer and he loves it.,0
"insanley good anatomy book: As an artist and sculptor this book is the diffenitive anatomy text book offering multiple view, cross sections, insertions and area placement of the muscles and bones of the human body. The illustrations are beutifully clear and concise. I have several anatomy books and this tops them all on realistic anatomy.",1
Great review of how rivers work with a sense of humor: This is a subperb review of how rivers systems work and how man-made changes effect these systems. Perfect for the interested layperson interested in earth science. The second half of this book covers the major watersheds of California.,1
"Long Winded. Dull. A Waste of Your Time.: Without a doubt, this has got to be the worst book I have read in a long time. What would have been an interesting blurb in the sociology section of 'Time' magazine, becomes hundreds of pages of pure mindless dreck in the hands of Jared Diamond. Let me save you a few days of your life by summing up the book: The reason why white, western / European societies flourished and the rest of the of the non-white, non-western world did not was because the European climate and terrain favored domestication of plants and animals while the rest of the world's terrain and climate did not. Therefore, western man had more free time on his hands to invent stuff and put a man on the moon, while the rest of the world, to this day, is still screwed up. Wow. I am so annoyed I read this book and wasted so much time doing so.",0
"Someone's gotta do it: It seems some are skeptical of Hawken's book because his ideas are too radical and no one will actually adopt his idealist suggestions. But this is the first book I've read that has made concrete suggestions that please both the business world and the environment. Yes it's radical, but the world is soon going to require radical solutions. I loved this book and admire his ingenuity.",1
"Hard to believe that this was a novel -: I have a hard time believing that this was a novel and not a personal memoir. (Or a biography of a close friend) Some of the events were so off the wall that while I can imagine them happening in real life, I have a hard time believing that someone could make this stuff up.I liked it a great deal. The idea of noting the goings-on from year to year on one's birthday with your dysfunctional family are just precious.Since I have it in my mind that this book is really non-fiction - I would have given it 5 stars save for the year when her Father comes around. I felt like that whole section was a bit more polished than it should have been.",1
"crate pad: Quality is not great for the price, would not buy again. You can find a similar item for less money and better quality.",0
Elvis Live (s): This is one of the albums I've been waiting for since that horrible day Elvis left us.The mix is finally improved in such a way that his band is finally given the credits it deserves.I never understood why the record labels always put his band in the background mix (except for the guitars and drums)... NOW one can finally enjoy the complete picture and comes more close to the real sound of this wonderful band. Special kudos to lead trumpet Walt Johnson and the wonderful bass trombone of Martin 'Marty' Harrell.,1
Broke after 5 weeks of use: It was OK while it worked. Reception wasn't that great. After 5 weeks of mild use it just stopped receiving any stations.,0
"I have more hair b/c of this book!!: I was PULLING MY HAIR OUT, trying to figure out how to get our almost 3.5 year to #2 on the potty! I heard about this book from a friend & searched hi & low for it. It's AWESOME! When he read this book w/ us, in the bathroom, he decided if elephants & fish #2'd, it would be OK for him to let it go too! YAY!",1
"sonny rollins - bad quality!!: I purchased this video on the recommendation of the amazon: ""list mania"", best drummer videos (...), which states that this video has a vintage 1973 performance from jack dejohnette. Well....you cant find out who the players are until you open the video and check it out, and unfortuantely, jack D. is nowhere to be found. In fact this is a very poor quality video thats only 30min long and incredibly boring. The sound quality sticks and its all cut up with short camera shots that make no sense. I highly recommend to buy something else!!!!",0
"Breathtaking: ""Hero"" is a wonderful album that all can enjoy. It is a masterpiece from start to finish. Kirk even includes his children as one son beat boxes for his father and the other one delivers spoken word on the outro. Kirk is sentimental and tremendously personal on ""Let It Go"", and he is also really inspirational on ""Imagine Me"" (My favorite song on the album). Then artists such as the marvelous Stevie Wonder, J Moss, Yolanda Adams, Tye Tribbitt, and Dorinda Clark-Cole grace this album with their presence. After listening to this album, I have to say that it is one of the best albums of all time (regardless of genre). Therefore, you should not miss out on this amazing experience.",1
"Keep looking.: This book desparately needs a second edition. It is full of grammatical errors, incomplete definitions, and generally poor editing. There are 100 practice questions at the end, and approximately half of the answers come with explanations. Other books seem to have a lot more. I haven't taken the exam yet, but I know after just a few pages that I would need additional material in order to be adequately prepared.",0
"A dud that critics love: There are a couple of bright moments on this disc, but one warning sign is that critics LOVE this disc. It is very flat overall, none of the dynamic, over the top imaginative hooks that we've come to love and expect from Phish. Billy Breathes has repetitive, boring melodies that anybody with a guitar and a dime could come up with. Gone are the epics. Gone is the humor. If you feel that you don't dig older Phish (Junta, Lawn Boy, Picture of Nectar), then try starting with The Story of the Ghost, there is a lot more substance to it. Billy Breathes is not really breathing at all.",0
"what a waste of money...the DS is much better: ok first of all this is a completely waste of money , why you ask? I'll tell you why , first of all it's expensive , the games are worth over $40 each , it needs a memory card to save your games and it's expensive!!.what this sony people are going to do are make movies to watch on this thing , I'll admit it it's cool , but only a psycho is going to buy this for $300 , i mean you could buy 2 DS !!.if you think I'm crazy , well this is my opinion I'll stick to it and the DS is much better than this,,YES!!!",0
its good: this product works good for cleaning the tiles with out having to deal with a mop and bucket.,1
"Very nice: This is my 3rd Olympus digital camera. I wanted a slimmer version of the great C-740 UltraZoom so I can carry it in my handbag.The optical zoom is only 5x but it has some nice features that are good for novices and more experienced photographers as well. It has an ""online"" guide which is great as well as tips for how to use the various settings.My only complaint is the proprietary battery pack - it comes with a recharger but unlike the C-740 UltraZoom, you cannot replace it with regular AA batteries. This is a problem when you travel in remote areas and don't have access to an electrical outlet (was 6 days in the desert in the Middle East) and you can't use regular AA batteries which you can buy at any souk.Otherwise, great little camera.",1

"What happened guys?: Look i LOVE incubus...always have, always will..great musicians and love what they do...but this album was a let down to say the least....i was pumped when i heard it was coming out...i almost bought it before it was even released...glad i didnt..i did buy it and im not sorry that i supported incubus...but this album lacks what the previous albums had...balls..great riffs...hard and soft sounds...not some wierd stuff with no chorus..beats..nothing, just a bunch of random workd on a page with some music...its not that the quality is bad..but it lacks the grungy/mello sounds of Make Yourself, morning view, and Science.....those were albums i could listen to over and over..this is not...maybe the members of Incubus have become meglomaniacs in their own way because this just cannot be the same Incubus i remeber, they've gone crazy in thinking that they'll make any money of this album.",0
Great Machine; pitiful pan: The Breadman machine has been wonderful for all the reasons mentioned in the reviews. But the pan does begin to leak after about 2 years and a replacement pan is no longer available - even from Salton. So what I have now is a great - expensive - machine that I can no longer use.,0
"Very frustrating!: I've struggled this this DVR for over a year. I freezes, inexplicable skips scheduled recordings, and has made so many disks that would not ""finalize"" that I have lost count. Very frustrated and will NEVER buy another Panasonic. There is no such thing as a ""fair price"" for a product that inflicts this much pain!",0
"DO NOT BUY!!! THERE ARE BETTER ALTERNATIVES!: I wish I would have read the reviews for this album, because if I had, I never would have bought it. Sure, it has a lot of great songs on it, but why in the hell would you butcher one of the greatest songs ever? Iron Man was the first Sabbath song I ever heard. In my opinion, it is possibly their best tune, and it is DESTROYED on this album. -WHAT THE !@$#? There are also a few songs that should not be on this album and a few that aren't, but should be. If you're just a casual Sabbath fan and don't mind the butcher getting a hold of Iron Man, this would not be a bad album for you. If you are a serious Sabbath fan, or you want to hear their music in its glorious entirety, I would suggest We Sold Our Soul For Rock N Roll (GREAT ALBUM)!!!I have also seen good reviews for Symptom Of The Universe, but I haven't heard that album yet. You may want to check that one out as well.",0
Subs: The movies and the pack are great but the movies doesn't have any subtitle. The description of the products shold be more specific. Thanks.,1
"Vapor Trails disappointing: I have been a big fan of Rush since 1976. Since then, I have seen them live 14 times. I have been waiting with much anticipation for this new CD to arrive and I am sorry to say I am disappointed. I kept forwarding to each new track searching for that ""old Rush hard rock sound"" that early reviews promised, but never found it. Just mediocre pop rock tunes with similar melodies and beats. In the past, as Rush as changed it's music I have come to appreciate at least some of the tracks on each of it's latest albums, but I don't think that will happen with this album. My advice to Rush: Do an ""All the World's a Stage Reunion Tour"" and watch your venues sell out. It'll never happen but what a thought!",0
"It wasn't bound like it was advertised: It wasn't the binder version which was advertised, which is what I wanted because you can add notes. This is the paperback and not user friendly. I let the person who I bought it from know this and she would not take it back!",0
"Quite boring but it keeps you off the streets for awhile.: I have to admit I didn't quite like this movie. The idea in itself is not a bad one, I haven't read the book so I can't say much about that but the movie is somewhat boring. It runs for about 3 hours when I get the idea that the plot would be better for a movie one hour shorter.I bought this movie knowing that it's director, Tobe Hooper, was the big man behind ""The texas chainsaw massacre"" which I loved. Salem's lot didn't live up to my expectations. It's plot develops real slow and it is quite predictable, the fact that it is an old movie doesn't justify that in any way. The movie desperately tries to create a chilling atmosphere yet never quite reaches it, which has nothing to do with the year the movie was made in.I can't say I found the watching of this movie a total waste of time, and it isn't expensive either. But if you like Tobe Hoopers work i'd skip this one and go straight to Poltergeist.",0
"Best Anime ever made, but Amazon's review is kind of off...: This is the best Anime that has ever been made - the animation is great, and the deep story will cause you to watch it over and over. But to quote Amazon.com's review: ""...the hope of mankind lies in a motorcycle punk by the name of Akira, whose own dormant powers arise during the conflict..."" - I don't quite think that Akira is the motorcycle punk in the movie. It goes to show that not everything on major sites is perfect. Oh, well. Buy the movie anyway! You won't regret it.",1
Practial guide to ecg interpretation: The book is very basic with little explanation of findings. It is less than I had hoped for in a book totally dedicated to one test analysis of heart heart function.,0
"A cornucopia of facts: You should read this book from cover to cover. I have been buying this book since the second edition. It is an excellent reference. Before you even open the DDK, run IDA Pro, or connect your kernel debugger, you need to know the fundamentals. This book lays it all out in the open.",1
"Sounds good while it lasts: I was initially impressed by the bass quality I got from this sub-woofer.I hooked it up to a low end low power amp and it was good for maybe 2 months then I noticed the sound became distorted.Something obviously broke loose inside and sounds like a typical speaker with tear in the cone, although I don't see one.Definitely not worth it.",0
"Not the best pick for a first-time Kingsolver reader...: Don't hate me for dissing this book, but as a reader who LOVED Animal Dreams (by Kingsolver), I couldn't get into The Poisonwood Bible. The main thing that bothered me was that each chapter is narrated by one of four sisters. They have interesting personalities but I kept getting them confused. Their voices weren't unique enough for me to distinguish. That structure grew tiresome and I stopped reading the book after about 50 pages.I also found the topic of a Baptist family moving to Africa to convert people off-putting. Even though it is supposed to be set in the past, I don't want to relive that time period and be reminded of that kind of mentality.The Poisonwood Bible should not be the first novel you pick up by Kingsolver. A better sampling would be Animal Dreams. It is more accessible to the reader.",0
"quite a departure..: This album is certainly very different than anything else Tori has done. There is so much versatility here, something perhaps to appeal to everyone. Translation (heh): i can't imagine someone not liking AT LEAST one song on this album, unless they just simply despise Tori's voice. Unlike the other albums, this one doesn't seem to have a flow but rather the songs are very individual.My favorite song is probably ""She's Your Cocaine"" because of the sheer funk of it. I'm no dancer, but this song makes me get UP. hahaha.go buy this. but not as your first tori album. i would recommend little earthquakes for that.",1
"Was not able to record longer songs: I tried it with 3 differnt usb sticks and I could sometiems successfully record a 3 minute songs, but most of the time it failed. I tried to record with an ipod - no success and also with 2 different external usb harddrives.I'm very glad that amazon took this unit back.I would not recommend this unit.",0
"Terrible Version: First of all let me say that I'm somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to Peter Pan. I own 25 or 30 different print versions, a half dozen audiobook versions, and another half dozen video versions. I've seen the play live several times in everything from high school productions to summer stock to professional touring companies. I realized when I ordered this DVD that it was an animated version aimed at younger children. I have nothing against that concept; several of the versions I already own are abridged, animated, or storybook versions. But this version is by far the worst of any I have seen. The story line has been modified so much that it's barely recognizable, the characters have no personalities, the animation is amateurish and lacks detail, and the voice acting is stilted and unemotional. I was hoping to find a version that would be appropriate for my four year old grandson. This isn't it.Peter Pan (Nutech Digital)",0
"Hit and Miss w/ Tiger '07: EA has obviously listened to the maddened consumer who screamed for more detail in something other than Tiger Woods face. The problem is they've overcompensated.Pros-More courses, a driving range, better customization for game face, excellent multi-player modeCons-Obscene ball control, no new golfers worth a damn, an introductory that makes the game unenjoyable for the 1st 20 tournamentsThey goofed. Instead of making a better golf game, they just made it more difficult. I'd learn to play real golf if I wanted to try this hard.They HAD a chance to shock and put Mickelson in as a playable golfer, besides a name on the leaderboard.They might NOT have made your golfer's improvement worse than VCR instructions.They COULD have realized a smaller hole legend is just annoying.They MAY have recognized that Tiger Woods is a golf game made to be fun, not homework.If you have '06, take a pass and pray for next year.",0
"Good history/klunky writing: Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one.",0
"BORING WORKOUT!!: If you want to fall asleep from Boredom while working out, then this is the workout for you. It's so slow and so boring that I could barely get through it two days in a row.",0

"An excellent book: This is another of my top three favorite DotM books and milestone in the DotM series. It explores Maggie's past and shows you how things that went on in the present were started in the past. It also shows how much faith Maggie has and the obstacles she's overcome to be the woman the Daughters love most. It was an excellent book, and I truly enjoyed it.",1
"A stupid homemade movie: A stupid homemade movie with friends and sold as a real film. Was it funny? No... Were the actors any good? No... Was the dialog any good? No... Was the premise believable? No... Could anyone ever make a worse comedy? Maybe, but I wouldn't bet on it... Could I ever recommend this film to anyone? Heck No...",0
"you call 3 episodes!!: Good show but not worth 23 dollars for three episodes! And since PBS plays them for free set your dvr and get them without commercials.hey BBC quit sending overpriced and counting the commentary episodes as run time to pad ""series"" as you call them. It's a crap thing to do!",0
"This tape is sacrilegious!: The quality [stinks]. The tape [stinks]. Generic label (as in black text, white label). Static screen, color washout, not worth the price of the tape it was recorded on (and at SLP to boot).If you buy this tape, you WILL regret it.It is sacrilegious to record Bugs Bunny with such poor quality!Man, I wish I read the reviews first....",0
Public Domain material often sells for $1 per disc .: I cannot imagine why this 12 or 8 DVD set sells for so much money when the producer did not have to pay any distribution rights for the material now in the public domain. My only criticism is price and that it should be priced accordingly for what it is. Why if you did not read these reviews and based on the price you might expect to be receiving a beautifully mastered set from excellent pre-print materials.,0
"good ext usb sound card: I am satisfied about this sound card. I thought I had to install more drivers but it does not need ANY!! If you prefer to install a software plus that comes boundle it, OK but It's ok for me. Additionally comes with an USB male/female extention to place the this ""pendrive"" like usb card. suggestion: take care about the adaptator to plug the fiberoptic cable, could be a mess if you miss this adapter. could bring a case to transport all the stuff inside. Sound quality for me is OK, I have not tested it's 7.1 surround system. I promise i will revertsee you",1
"Brando Spinning in a Void: The first film in Marlon Brando's five-picture deal with Universal, ""The Ugly American"" (1963) is a dreary political drama that the actor cannot bring to life. Flat direction by George Englund - further hindered by the obvious backlots substituting for Thailand. Brando tries, but has nothing to work with here.",0
"Superb!: If the next two books are anything close to this one I seriously believe this is one series no fantasy fan should miss.The characters are so complex and live-like you just can't stop falling in love with them. The story is so well developed and so interesting you just have to stay awake to read just a few more pages (usually until four or five in the morning). It's thrilling, well paced, intoxicating. One of the very best books I've reading this last couple of years and I've readen a lot. Highly recomended for mature readers.Like every work of art it has its drawbacks 'cause nothing can be perfect, but for me the only problem of the book is that Martin never stays with the same character for more than 10 pages. He switches characters just when you are starting to warm up to them. But, oh well, we'll have to live with that.",1
"rad tributes: bradley would be glad to hear this..it's a really awesome cd with awesome covers by all who are on it. i didn't think i would like every song on this but i do except maybe for grayboy allstar's cover of doin' time (it drags on to me). otherwise every cover from jack johnson's ""badfish/boss dj"" to watts/haden's cover of ""work that we do"" is awesome. the only thing other then grayboy allstars cover that was a bit of a downner for me was no doubt's live cover..it's an old live cover, you would like to think that those guys could update it in the studio. those are just tiny things though that i'm sure i'll get over, over time. what counts is that this cd is awesome and you should really pick it up if your a sublime fan or even if you wanna hear something different such as different takes on great sublime songs. it's well worth the money.",1
incorrect: This book actually contains incorrect information on one of the most difficult things for students to grasp: how rolled cylinders work.,0
"Awful!: Pointless, with annoying characters. The one character I did like, Maggie, was completely WASTED! Williams did nothing with her, which was a sin since she's a great character. Read A streetcar named desire if you want a good play by williams.",0
"Annointed, and Inspiring!!!!: I absoloutely love this project! It captures the true heart of worship. Maureen's voice is captivaing, and has a presence that demands attention. Her range is exceptional as well. But most of all she's annointed. There is a sincerity in her singing that that touches you, and takes you into the presence of GOD. Prepare to experience an intamate moment in God's presence. This is definately one of the best worship projects i've heard.",1
"Just Okay...: Easy ordering, fast delivery. The product wasn't what I thought. I thought the pretzel was filled with garlic and cheese (sort of like the product Combos), but it was seasoned with garlic and cheese flavor (which was too salty).",0
"Real World?: Although I have enjoyed Barbara Delinsky's more recent novels, this one was so full of unrealistic sex that one could forget the plot!",0
Very Enjoyable: I loved this book from the first chapter. Before I knew it I was finished. I would highly recommend this book. All the town's people are interesting and entertaining. An Sookie is a very fun character to follow.,1
"Quality tools: I bought this item to use mostly for woodworking. The 18"" blade is useful for marking and measuring wider boards. I own many L.S. Starrett products and you can count on quality and precision every time.",1
"BAD APPLE!: False advertising. The product is advertised as an Apple product and is the reason I ordered it. Well, after receiving it today, I realized it was a knockoff. I could have paid much less for the same product. Now it's not worth returning. Amazon should not allow this!!! Disappointed customer.",0
"An amazing look at the other side: Since we live in the West, we get the West's version of history. Halim Barakat, a lebbonese christian offers us an amazing fictional look at the Six Days War that not only crystilizes non-Israeli sentiment on the issue, but created a form of Arabic revolutionary literature when first published. Barakat's work is persuasive, fiery prose, intercutting several characters but mainly concerning itself with Ramzy (or ""symbol"") his autobiographical main character. This book is one of the more powerful 180 pages I've read, and the introduction by Edward Said is really great. The book occasionally lurches toward self indulgence, but considering that Barakat is not a novelist by trade, I think this is excusable. By this book. Read it. Change your mode of thought.",1
"A fascinating tale of American lives: This is much more than a biography of Al Capone. Bergreen gets right to the heart of the world Capone traveled in with all its duality. You see Capone the Violent and Capone the Benevolent. This portrait is butressed by a thorough exploration of the crime world Capone traveled in.Balancing Scarface's story is lesser know story of Capone's brother, who fled the family, changed his name and became a lawman out west. The comparison/contrast of the two brothers and the lives they chose is a strange and compelling family portrait. The result is a real page-turning American biography.Some minor mistakes on Chicago geography and small historical errors prevent me from giving this 5 stars. Regardless, the writing and the story are compelling. This is well worth the price of admission.",1
"Terrible-Run don't walk from this book: What the author should have crafted was a good book, not a retirement plan for himself.This is garbled enough to make beginner's bawk and simplisticly sanguine enough to make the more experienced choke.Either way you're better off finding the tried and true standards by authors who know their stuff and have earned the right to be read. This author has had little actual experience in this area. Read his bio which I should have done before buying this book. Caveate emptor.",0
"Not so Simple: This is the first NAS device I bought, hoping to use it for backing up all my PC's and laptops at home. Sharp looking device with good potential but not as simple as the name indicates. It has a slow CPU and is limited to 10/100 Mbps network (1000 Mbps is standard on most other NAS servers). The SimpleShare worked for a total of 15 mins after which it showed consistent permission errors. The drive failed to attach (or publish) itself to the Windows network. Having networked offices nationwide, I'm fairly familiar with the diagnostic routines. After two days however, I gave in and called SimpleTech support. Over the course of two additional days (and long hold times), I spoke to 3 different people, neither of whom could help me solve the problem. Two of them actually suggested I should just return (not exchange!) the product and find something more suitable. In the end, I took their advice.",0
"It was pretty good: I bought this book because I am hooked on grail legends. I loved the Da Vinci Code and I thought this would be somewhat like it. It's not and actually that was ok. Although it was a little slow at first it definitely picked up once you are about a third into it and overall I thought it was a very good read. Although it's not non-stop action like DVC, I thought it was a story that was very well told. I do have one small compaint, though... there is dialogue between the charcters in French that are not translated into English. I don't speak French so I was at a loss as to what the charcters were saying. Nonetheless, I would still definitely recommend it.",1
"Quiet and Cool: This is my favorite fan I've ever bought because it actually works. I keep it on the low mode to sleep and the room is quiet and cool. I have two floors, with the top one getting really hot, but when I stuff this thing at the bottom of the stairs and syphon the air up, its actually cooler. I would easily get a second one! Highly recommended.",1
"A Great CD: I discovered Iron and Wine on the Garden State CD. Since then I have bought 3 of their CDs. One of the best things I like about this CD is the style of their music is consistent. Iron and Wine sounds somewhat like Simon and Garfunkel with an edge to it. I highly recommend this CD, and Endless Summer Days, which is just as good.",1
"Terrible for pet owners: I've had this vacuum for about 2.5 years and can't believe I have not tossed it in the trash yet (prevented by limited finances). This was my first bagless vacuum and will be my last. It is so filthy and disgusting to have all the dirt and dust exposed to the air.I have 2 cats and one dog who are average shedders. I cannot completely vacuum one room with this vac without the area above the dust cup getting clogged. Then I have to reach my hand up into the vacuum to clear the clog, thus covering my hand in dust and spreading dust into the air. The process of emptying the dust cup is filthy and gets more dust into the air and all over the vacuum. The attachments, like the duster and the power paw, are cheap and useless.I don't recommend that anyone buy this vacuum.",0
Door Posts: I ordered this book because the vendor said that it was in like new condition! It was for a gift--I did not give it for the following reason. The book had stamped in it the library where it came from and it was NOT anywhere new looking--it definitely was in used condition and not very good condition. I learned my lesson and will only purchase new books when giving them as gifts!,0
"Disappointed: Like so many ""literary"" reads this was disappointing. Oprah's ""picks"" tend to lean towards too much in the depressing/dysfunctional mode. Too many other ""worthwhile"" books out there to read than this one.",0
The Deepest Prayer: Thirst is simply the most beautiful book I have ever read and the most honest and beautiful prayers of a seeker. For all other seekers: it will speak to and of your heart. Enjoy.,1
The last of the best: A well written book by perhaps one of best sports writers of all time. He holds your interest on every page. Sadly he passed away several years ago after a great career with the Los Angeles Times Sports Department.,1
"Flo & Go: Overall quality of the tank itself is OK. However, the nozzle hose came loose at the tank end after only a couple of weeks, spilling gas all over me. The hose really needs to be fitted with some kind of clamp rather than just a push-on force. Plus the hose itself is a cheap plastic type tending to easily collapse. I'm in the process of purchasing a true automotive quality fuel hose with clamps. Bottom line is I would not have puchased this item had I known about this serious shortcoming. For the relatively high price charged the design and quality should have been better.",0
"MAybe as good as any of Clancy's efforts: I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels and a few of his non fiction books, this one is pretty good. The setting is a few months after Patriot Games and I guess a few months before The Hunt for Red October and I think is one of two (Patriot Games is the other)to have any significant blending of real historical characters with fictional characters.You do have some swearing but not really any more or any worse than previous efforts, Catholicism does have a big place (but no more than other Clancy books),and some will be offended by Clancy's obvious great admiration for Ronald Reagan and his policies. Ignore just those not really intrusive parts and enjoy the book, it's shorter than The Bear and The Dragon and doesn't have the unlikely future history or possibly too good to be true weapons.",1
"very nice soft music: If you know Polish you do not need explanation - kupuj CD bardzo mila i nastrojowa muzyka. If you do not know Polish, look for Polish people in USA then ask them to teach polish, then buy. I love America.",1
"This is a VERY fascinating book.: The author takes a quite scientific approach to a very unscientific subject in this book, offering evidence and examples of animal telepathy and precognition. Obviously, the examples and case studies are the most interesting parts of the book and the science behind the theory is easily broken down to make this an entertaining non-fiction book. I do wonder if in the nine years between this book's publication and my discovery of it, if the outlined experiments for further study took place. And what the results were... maybe a follow-up or an updated version will be published at some pointEither way, I heartily enjoyed this book (though I don't think my dog is terribly psychic) and would most definitely recommend it to anyone at all interested in this fascinating subject matter.",1
"Very Disappointing!: I was extremely disappointed in this book. The book contained only 25 pictures, all of which were 90% black on white!! This left very little room for coloring on ANY of the pictures. Many of the pics were nudes (doesn't leave much for the imagination)! I will never buy this type book again and I suggest others don't either!",0
"Great product: I have lived in Japan where they get a lot of snow, and this is the way to move snow. I looked all over for a shovel like this when I came back to the states. You don't have to lift the snow and can take it wherever you need to dump. Use it like a sled full of snow and just dump it wherever you need. Can easily clear my 100'X45' driveway in a matter of minutes and no sore back. After you figure out that you don't have to muscle it around like a regular shovel, you'll love it.",1
"Take the Gambling out of Investing: Excellent book on the unpredictability of investments and investors.It essentially says investing in individual stocks is speculating (gambling), not investing. Over the long haul, individual investors (event the top fund managers) don't beat the overall market.Invest in the S&P; 500 or other major index and you will build a fine nest egg for retirement, according to the book.This is not a book for someone who wants to double their money in 2 years. It is for the person who wants to turn $100,000 into $800,000 in 21 years (assuming 7% returns that double your money every seven years). Not a bad end for an extremely diversified and responsible investment plan.So if you are 44 years old, and you have $200,000 to invest, you could safely build it to $1.6 million when you turn 65, if this book is correct. I think it is.",1

Not What I Expected: I ordered this doll in the hopes of giving it to my niece for her birthday. It was much smaller than I expected. I returned it because I had a feeling she wouldn't get much use out if it since it was tiny. Unless whoever you're buying this for really likes American Girl I wouldn't recommend this product.,0
"Excuse me: Excuse me ! Sadly I am required to give it a star because if it were up to me it would have none.But to the point. I have almost lost trust in the library system. Aren't they supposed to screen books for its readers? My sister borrowed it and started to read it. She stopped after a few pages , not even finishing the first chapter because of the language. Then my father looked through it and found an area with explicit descriptions of things a 13 year old ,or anyone for that matter, should be reading about! I don't recommend this book to any person.",0
The Forests of Silence: Great book.It was very easy to read and enjoyable.I never guessed what was going to happen and was pleasantly surprised by some of the twists.,1

"It was a little less than ok: Pretty much says it in the title. I absolutely love DC comics and about 95% of their of their movies. In fact DC Comics helped me decide what I want to do with my life, thats why I hate giving them less than amazing reviews. This movie was an amazing idea and I had high hopes for it, but I was let down. All I really gotta say is: William Baldwin as BATMAN?????? REALLY????? That killed 35% of the movie for me and then Batman is supposed to be a genius, but in this movie he seemed about half the intelligence he actually has.....",0

"First taste of Eddie and the Tide............: This album (EP, actually) was the first taste that people were given in the SF Bay Area of Eddie and the Tide. The EP set some records (no pun intended)for sales of an indie release in the area. IT gave the band some radio airplay. It can only be found in this format unless you check out eddieandthetide dot com and ask there. GREAT STUFF!",1
"Not Quite Up There: While a good album it is nowhere near on the level as ""Music From Big Pink"" let alone their previous release ""The Band.""Still, if you're an anal enough record collector I would suppose you should get this to fill out your ""Band"" collection; it's certainly better than their next album, ""Cahoots"" which has a majority of four star reviews and deservedly so.",1
"You Get What You Pay For: We ordered this product to help us keep our litter box area free of stray litter kicked out by the cat, and we think it will do that, but there were some problems with the order. First, the item came only in an Amazon box with some paper filler. Upon inspection, the filter compartment latch appeared to have been broken and it would not close. Second, the litter box was supposed to include a filter and a liner, per the description (""Comes with a free filter and liner in each box."") however, these items were not in the box. We contacted Amazon customer service, but the only options required a return, which is a big hassle for this plastic item. At least Customer Service gave us a 10% discount, and the initial price seemed a good value, since the regular price at PetCo is about $50. Basically, you get what you pay for, and some things are better purchased at an actual store. Kudos to Amazon for at least trying.",0
"Never before described crime and corruption: This book opened my eyes as to what some cops have to undergo to make our cities safe. It is not fair that we call on them to do so much, and when things go wrong, we hang them out to dry. These people are true unsung heros to every man, woman and child in the United States.Mr. Nichols, bring us more books that we can read and enjoy, and maybe even weep.",1
"Mysteries are fun, but: The Concord Cunningham books are fun to read and I don't particularly care for mysteries. My son, age 9, loves these books! We use them in our homeschool curriculum.This is a great way to get my son into the Bible. He loves to look up the clue verse and try to solve the mystery. The mysteries are short and fast-paced.I plan to collect the entire series.",1
NOT the same as the larger models -- too small to be useful: 1. This unit is too small - even for one cup it isn't big enough2. It features an inferior filtering mechanism (I figured everything would be the same as the larger models .. I was wrong)3. The pictures don't give any feel for the actual size of the productStinks ... on ice,0
"Finally, another Team Rocket CD!: Maemuki Rocket Dan (roughly translating into ""Forward-Looking Team Rocket"") is the 11th ending theme for the Pocket Monsters series in Japan. There are three tracks on this single:1. Maemuki Rocket Dan; 2. Maemuki Rocket Dan Karaoke; 3. Maemuki Rocket Dan Remix. These are definetly the weirdest songs Team Rocket has ever sung. The first track is a long version of the TV ending theme, the second is an instrumental of the first track, and the third is a remix of the first track; many would call this the ""Para Para Remix"" for obvious reasons when you hear the song. Included in the first and third tracks are cameos by Sonans (Wobbuffet for English-speakers). This album is very entertaining and I would recommend it to every Team Rocket fan and any die-hard Pokemon fan.",1
Not as good as her earlier works...: I have to agree with the readers that have stated this is not as good as her earlier works. She seems to be losing her passion and style. This book is very disjointed in places and I don't care for the personal references she throws in from time to time. The story will be moving along somewhat smoothly then she out of nowhere interjects a personal statement. It really takes away from the narrative.Also don't like the ficticious names nor the recycling of old stories. Ms. Rule is a much better author than this book would ever show.,0
"Does what it says: I purchased the product to mix in powder into water/juice. The product does what it says. The motor is fine for most powder mixes, however it will no crush ice or fruit.I wish the rod was a bit longer so that you could truely mix from the bottom of a glass other than that it works fine.",1
"Don't waste your money: If I could have rated it no stars or minus stars, I would have. I have used Ames products all my life, buying them at Ace Hardware stores. So imagine my surprise when I found an Ames axe for 15 bucks. It ain't an Ames; it's parent company Woodings-Verona's poor excuse for a tool. The casting is extremely rough (an understatement, and my axe had dings all over the head and nicks on the blade). The handle was so rough from a poor finishing job, that I knew I'd have blisters after a few swings. Poor workmanship, quality and appearance make the Woodings-Verona ""Ames"" axe only fit for the slag heap.",0
"Save Your Money: My daughter begged for this toy so she could make McFlurries. What a waste of money. The crank was so difficult to turn that I even gave up on it. In addition, the end product would fill 1/4. The picture shows this BIG milkshake like product, but what comes out is a drippy 1/4 cup of cream like mixture. McDonalds should be embarrassed to have their name on this toy. I won't even sell it at the garage sale, its going into the garbage.",0
"disappointing: Endless writing to nowhere. This was disappointing compared to her other works, French Relations being her best. Dragged myself through it without really caring about any of the characters... arsonist hits small, horsey town filled with dysfunctional, constantly drunk families. Plot twists and mysteries were confusing. It wasn't funny, believable, or really interesting in the end.",0
"A Sexy & Schizophrenic Romp: To the point: If the presence of bi-sexual blood-lusting vampires, amorous cigarette-smoking Englishmen, cheesy movie soundtracks, and casual soft porn horror makes your heart skip a beat in joy, you will find lots to like about Vampyres.The women in the title roles are easy on the eye, and their antics on scren may give male viewers pause the next time they see lady hitchhikers on the road. While the plights of Fran (Marianne Morris) and Miriam (Anulka) are never clearly explained, their onscreen seductions and violence perpetrated on male victims are such that it is hard to imagine anyone sleeping well after upon watching this movie.Not the best of its kind, but certainly worthy of the occasional rewatching with pals on a movie night.",1
Huge WASTE of time!: What a waste of time this garbage ended up being. Mildly amusing for about 50% of the game- then it becomes a chore as you have to back track through 90% of the game to find areas that were previously unreachable. But the one that will KILL you is this horrible platforming level that you MUST complete to achieve the final security key- and it's clear that the game developers had no plans for you to ever complete it. It has everything bad going for it- so if you want to play a game 75% of the way through only to hit a monumental wall- then this game is for you- for all of the rest of you- don't waste your time!,0
"Tedious: I've read and enjoyed all of Ann Rice's vampire books, but the Mayfair books are so boooooring and tedious that I couldn't finish this one. It goes on and on and on with various personal histories, explanations of individual family members. Interspersed among the longwinded tedious trivia are a few moments of something happening, but even those are usually hard to comprehend. Toward the end Lasher forces us to listen to his long-winded explanation of his life. How he came to be in control of the Mayfair home is a mystery that happens in some incomprehensible half page. By then I was so bored that I put it down and haven't gotten back to it. Read it if you're a really dedicated Rice fan willing to endure endless punishment.",0
"Review of the kindle edition: This is a poorly formatted ebook. The text is forced into a difficult font (unchangeable). The word spacing is variable so that the text at any size contains rivers of whitespace flowing down the middle of the ""page"" rather than on having an uneven right hand side of the page like a book. Either wait for a properly formatted kindle version or buy the hard copy.",0
"Outstanding adaption of the Hugo story!: It's about time this version of ""Hunchback"" made it to DVD. Anthony Hopkins rivals Lon Chaney in portraying Quasimodo as Hugo described him in his novel. The supporting cast is superb; and, with the exception of the surprise ending, this version is faithful to the novel. The DVD has several extended scenes that the old VHS and TV version lacked. There is once scene not in the VHS or TV version in which Dom Claude is standing by the river Seine mumbling to himself about ""killing her"". Two men come upon him and escort him back to the cathedral. I'd rank this version superior to the Laughton version but just under the Chaney version. Needless to say it leaves the Quinn, Clarke and Patinkin versions in the dust. If you're a ""Hunchback"" fan, make sure you have this version in your video library.",1
great!!: This is a great item. It has plenty of storage. The only bad thing is that it eats up batteries.,1
"Welcome to the most famous Harlem' s nightclub!: The creative energies of Coppola were still sparkling. This movie is a heartfelt tribute to an Age that just lives in the memory of a whole generation, that were teenagers after the WW2 and grew and grew up under the magic spell of Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis, Django Reinhardt, Errol Garner and a countless list of big names of the Jazz.Obviously, Coppola remarks once more the hidden codes of the myth through the presence of the duality, expressed through the story of two brothers; one white the other black, and a fabulous interweaved connection of secondary plots.To my mind this is one of the best achievement of Coppola in the genre of chamber works of his notable career. Gregory Hines made the greatest role of his lifetime. Watch for that Goddess called Diane Ladd in her 19.",1
"Written by a guy, what?: One thing that amazes me about this book is the author's non-cliche perspective. He really fuses a non-male (not to be gender stereotypical, okay, I am) voice and gives this girl-woman such a feminine thought process. The character is a wonderful introduction to the mysterious and electrifyingly seductive world of the Geisha and her role in Japanese life. It's a fascinating read about people and how they strive to better themselves and this book is a beautifully written, rich delve into watershed landscapes, fabrics, blossoms, and love and obsession, and how a girl becomes a woman and learns the art of emotional foreplay. Of course it became a film and rarely do movies do books justice and in this case, the book is the keeper. Enjoy.",1
"A Great Musical Discovery!: I know Butterscott tapes have been circulating around since the 90's, but I had never heard them before this ""official"" album. Butterscott is a lot like Jonathan Richman or They Might Be Giants in that the music has a great, catchy ""pop"" feel to it, but there's brilliant cynicism just below the surface. And Butterscott is funny and biting, too.If you're like me, and were weened on groups like Cake, Soul Coughing, Neutral Milk Hotel, etc., I really think you'll love Butterscott.In other words, this album is a must for any jaded music fan.",1
"Not what I thought, Buy the video instead: This was a very dissapointing purchase. I think maybe the targeted age should be increased to 8-10 years old. It is mostly multiplication and geometry. And there is an awful board game, where it takes away the very rewards that you won.(I understand that subtraction is part of math, but I think they could have did it another way without it seeming like a punishment.) It just was not fun for my child, everything seemed too much like work.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the ability to acess the school house rock music videos and the pool game was okay too. But just okay.",0
"Good roller: I do really like this roller, and I like that it came with a video to show me how to use it since I had never had one before. I feel like it has lost some of it's shape (is a bit squished) after not much use, and I'm not very big (about 120lbs). Some others might be sturdier. When I buy a new one I will look for something sturdier, but this was good for a first-time user.",1
"Not Great Singing. A Marketing Rip-off: While I suppose this is meant to take a listener back into the movie, which I very much appreciate, and I bought it from Amazon, I did not realize what I was buying when I bought this CD. Having bought it, I feel ripped off: this, to my mind, is a ploy to extend revenues. For Gregorian Chant one can buy CDs of the monastic choirs of Solesmes and Fontgaumbult, to name only two sources of Gregorian Chant that have great sound quality and choirs. This ""sound track"" of the movie, complete with stray, unidentifiable noises, displays a mediocre choir and very poor sound quality. If you must have it, buy it used. I have one for sale.",0
"Thuvia is great: As a long-time ERB fan, I have always favored the Mars series (right behind the Pellucidar series). As a youth, when I first bought the book, I had my doubts; having cut my 'martian teeth' on Pricess and Warlord. However, true to Burroughs style, the action picked up quickly and was on par with the other books in the series. A great read.",1
"Not worth the money!: My son liked this gym for only a few weeks. He quickly became bored with the toys and the musical lights made him cry everytime they were turned on. Luckily we received this as a gift and we didn't pay the hefty $50 pricetag. We now have the Gymini by Tiny Love and my son (4 months) LOVES playing with it every morning. The music is much better, the hanging animals are more captivating, and the large mirror is perfect for curious infants. Save yourself some money and buy the Tiny Love Gymini.",0
"Miss Silver Deals with Death - highly recommended: As always from Patricia Wentworth, this book is enchanting. She takes the reader back into the previous century with her characters and their view of the world after the second Great War.",1
"Give me back my time please!: hahahahahhahhaah this movie is EXACTLY like it's name... H-O-L-L-O-W... Oh gosh, this was bad, really bad! Save yourself; don't even think about pushing play. Ha!",0
Back pain no more: I thought the information was useful at times and other times i felt i needed a stronger back ground of schooling to understand the author. Overall good for understanding how the mind works but there are better books on exercises to help with my back pain. Buy a more up to date book.,0
"Best Political Book I've Read - Exposes Carter Completely: This tightly edited classic wisely uses a straightforward, chronological approach in bringing the 1980 Presidential election to vivid life. It is not overly long as these authors' book on Bush vs Dukakis '88 election was. Well worth the hassleof buying used.Carter's lack of political instincts and his often contradictory personality (usually conciliatory yet capacle of pettiness and vindictiveness) are well illustrated here. The '80 primary elections are wonderfully covered, even minor candidiates such as Howard Baker and Robert Dole are covered. Teddy Kennedy's only presidential campaign is thoroughly dissected. The authors evenhandedly cover the Reagan and Carter and (remember) John Anderson campaigns. Buy it!",1
"Great Little Set of Chopsticks: I was looking for a nice simple set of chopsticks that wasn't too expensive and these fit the bill perfectly. I have had them for about a month now and they are great. I love the way they feel and they hold up great. I have used them for cooking as well and they show no signs of any wear. I have small hands so I hold them just after the twist part with no trouble at all. I saw that some people thing the twist is weird for them but I don't even notice it. I love these, I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice cheap set they can re-use as an alternative to disposables.",1
"The book is very pricy.: I am taking a Spanish Conversation class at a local community college, using this book as the text book.The book is very pricy, for a 300 page paperback text book. I am assuming that the high price is because it has a web site that provides some additional resources.However, most of the items on that web site are locked. I do not know which locked resources are accessible by a student. In addition, to create a student id requires a course code. Neither my teacher nor the school administer has the code.There is a 7 day trail access option to access the locked resource, but that option requires user to provide credit card information.I do not recommend this book to any one, unless it is clear what resources can be accessed by a student or a book owner and the content of the web site has been evaluated.",0
fun wtih the Polar express: My 3 year old son got this (and the other parts of the Polar Express Brio train) for Christmas. He is a HUGE fan of the movie and LOVES these toys. We have read the book so many times and seen the movie even more times that we set up the train and he runs the movie plot right there in the living room. Brio makes good quality stuff and even the price on Amazon seemed pretty reasonable!,1
"Best DM cd since Violator...: The trademark keyboard-synth sound is no more, but DM comes back with their best work since Violator. Bass-heavy, muted tracks are the backdrop, while David Gahan's vocals are in fine form.That being said, it's not like Violator, Music for the Masses, or even the awful Songs of Faith and Devotion. It's a new sound for DM, and I like it.",1
"Great Product: Ultimate Dip Stand - arrived quickly, decent comparative price, easy to assemble with color coded connections (impossible to put it together incorrectly), assembled in less than 10 minutes and does what I expected it to do - support my weight (200 lbs/ 5' 10""). Couldn't ask for more.",1
"Sorry, I was sleeping, what did you say?: I guess if you are a hippie from the 60's, or enjoy music even more mellow than John Denver, then you may like this CD. However, if you are looking for some good rocking music, or at least some mellow music with lyrical substance, than this album is not for you. I assumed this was going to be a bluesy folk album, but Lullaby was so boring I almost fell asleep. I suppose if that is what a lullaby is supposed to do, it did the job. Don't waste your time and money on this album. If you want this music, just go down to your local coffee shop. There, you only need to buy a cup of coffee vs. the 15 bucks for an attractive yet expensive frisbee.",0
"This is not a Kung-Fu movie!: This movie is beyond ridiculous. The effects are horrible, there is no plot, and the fight scenes are juvenile. The worst thing is that this is not a martial arts film. If you are a fan of The Power Rangers, then this movie is for you! If you like kung-fu flicks (Drunken Master, Fists of Legends) then avoid this movie at all costs.",0
"""Issues"" has Issues: A typical overhyped release. Obviously Korn believes fans will put up with the constant change in music style, unfortunately some fans do. This album is simply trash. Korn has potential but wastes it on trash like this. Don't get me wrong I do own and enjoy their self labeled release ""Korn"". It gave metal a new dimension. It kicked and really stayed heavy, something most metal albums don't do. But after the release of ""Korn"" everything went downhill. Six years with three albums worth of chances and Korn has gotten worse and worse. Even with their horrible music they have still held onto fans. Their lyrics of violence has turned their fans into pre-meditating murderers, or at least most of them. Just visit the Kornweb message boards. Anyway, this album like everyother korn release (Except for ""Korn"" their '94 self titled album)is a waste of money and listening time.",0
"Don't set your child up for a BIG disappointment!!!: Best to buy 'pets' from a pet rescue group / realiable pet store!Almost always these poor little 'mail order' creatures perish way before your child can enjoy watching them turn into frogs....the environment in these containers are NOT conducive for healthly growth.Don't set your child up for a BIG disappointment and why make an animal suffer anyway??? Not a good thing to teach a child...can be psychologically damaging. ugh!It may cost more money to get the proper foods, habitat etc. as well as taking the time to read and learn about the new pet, which will be safer and more fun, but the rewards will be well worth it.Enjoy God's Creatures with care and respect! :)NOTE: Uncle Milton company sells other great non-living toys/educational items which we have enjoyed...they just have to ditch selling live animals asap!",0
"Not suitable for glass: I agree with the other reviewer of this product. We use this in our office where we have plenty of glass surfaces and honestly it doesn't work to clean glass. It leaves a very nasty white streak, very similar to something greasy. The only way I was able to remove some of the residue was with a very dry paper towel and even then it did not work.I also agree that it has a great scent, and very pleasant to use, as well as a strong cleaner for other surfaces, but that's about it. I do not recommend it for glass since it leaves a white film over the glass and it does not come off. Unfortunately the only thing that worked for us was white vinegar dissolved in water and we cleaned the glass tables with newsprint or whatever left over newspaper we have for the day. That works wonders and can also be classified as ""going green.""",0
This is a good one.: I love this DVD !!! Watched it twice this weekend. Only can someone tell me why it took so long for somebody to do a film like this?,1
"If you have made it this far: These books, after reading the 5 previously of course, for me have more than made a good story, but introduced me to someone I will undoubtedly remember my entire life. Fitz is more than a character in a book, you are in his mind, share his good luck, bad, happy times and sad ones. You feel emotions as if you are the one experiencing everything, I wish I could find more books with the same type of in depth character relationships... I don't know if i will. If you are someone thinking about picking up assassin's apprentice. Do it, you will thank me later.",1
"Jay-z Blueprint: Normally I am a fan of Jay-z, but this ablum makes me wonder if he is more worried about the number of cd's he will release ""In his lifetime"", rather than the quality of his music. At first I couldn't believe he released IZZO as his first song off the ablum, but after listening to the ablum many times I realized that it is the only song anywhere close to decent. Every song off the ablum just seems to be thrown together. The hooks are weak and his lyrics are just plain old. If you want to be lulled to sleep by the same old stories and...beats, then this is the ablum for you. Just remember that when you buy this cd, you are doing exactly what he wants people to do and that is make him go platinum. That way he will have something to brag about on his next cd. which will probably be released later this year!",0

Terrible Quality: I owned and lightly used this product for about 18 months. The remote control seems to work with every other electronics product programmed into it but the Toshiba DVD player.

"Don't Forget to Think: This is a response to some of the other reviews. You have to remember that there are such things as symbolism and metaphor in literature. Also, there is historical context to keep in mind when reading this novel. People who find this book boring are taking it at face value. Example, the bull fighting is not there just for entertainment, it is also a metaphor.",1
"An uncreative ending to a good series: I loved the immortal series! Daine was so wonderful to read about! I always knew Daine was going to marry him, it was so easy to see in the other books! But I really hate this book because the ending was soo easy and predictable.",0

"INSPIRING AND UPLIFTING!!!!!!!: I have told everyone I can about this book. You need to see the movie too! The movie follows the book fairly close.

"Behe's defender falls flat: On 14 March 2002, someone who calls herself only ""Amber"" critiqued my 12 March review of Behe's book. For example, concerning the second error I mentioned in Behe's book, Amber writes that ""I don't know much about this situation"" but nevertheless calls the point I make an ""absurdity.""Amber thus admits that she has made up her mind without bothering to familiarize herself with the situation. It is, obviously, impossible to hold an intelligent conversation with anyone whose mind is tightly closed to fact.So I won't attempt to.",0
"A deep book: The Heart is a lonely Hunter is a very different sort of book. I've read quite a few books, and never one quite like it. One person I know compared it to the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath because of the dark story line. The story is based upon the lives of 5 main characters, the majority of the story telling spent on the mute John Singer and the teenager Mick Kelly. Themes of alienation, isolation, intolerance, loneliness, and the fulfillment of dreams dominate the novel. The opposite of a superficial book, this story is about how people feel at their core and their dreams and aspirations. The writing is good, but just not very happy. The focus is more on how lonely each character feels and for what reasons. After reading it, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter forced me to think deeply. And I believe the title sums up what Carson McCullers was trying to say in her first novel.",1

"Great book!: This book is a great informational book (and a quick and easy read). It also has a wonderful book list in the back. I find myself taking it to the library with me, when choosing children's books. I am very happy with it, and recommend it to all my friends who are interested in giving their children (and themselves) great literary options.",1

"Poor manufacturing, terrible sound: I bought these headphones as a replacement for my second pair of blown iPod earbuds, hoping to get stronger bass and better sound isolation. I got both. Unfortunately, the sound coming out of these headphones is extremely muddy and overly bass-heavy. Furthermore, they were quite painful in my ears the first several times I wore them and the mini-jack has a poor connection, often leaving me without sound in one ear.Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones, particularly if you're looking to buy in-ear headphones.",0
"A disappointment: Why write a book on a subject that you don't completely know?With five pages dedicated to Kate Bush and six to Terje Rypdal one can easily think the author has a very original idea of what progressive music is about.Non-english speaking artists have a very limited attention here, and the ones mentioned are mostly in the instrumental-only and jazz-inspired field.And being italian, I can't really stand the assertion that italian prog is ""dated, clichéd, badly produced"", hence totally ignored in this book....",0
"Matrix Method: I ordered the Kathy Smith, Matrix Method to try something new after using many of the Kathy Smith workouts over the years, and I have been using ""Lift Weights to Lose Weight"" for over 2 years and love it in addition to running.This is so much more fun and efficient. It works all body parts at the same time, upper, core, and lower and is easy to follow and fast paced. The workout is as hard as you want to make it or easy if you need to. The 10 minute core workout is quick and works the abs completely. I really like the relaxation stretching segment, it has helped my back tremendously. All in all, I am thrilled with this workout as it is a thorough workout, timesaver, and moves very quickly. I do not like to change routines, but this one is worth it.",1
"Great book for the stubborn child...: After reading this book, I finally realized how to define the power struggles I constantly have with my 3 1/2 year old. She's a strong willed child. She pretty much has all the characteristics of a strong-willed child outlined in this book. After reading it, I immediatly put the books suggestions into place and in little as a week have already seen tremendous results. I highly recommend this book to any parent having endless power struggles with their child.",1
I had to returned it to Amazon: Basically this is review for the Amazon pricing and not the item itself. I had to returned it to Amazon as it was being sold at 1/10th of the price on the competition site. I requested Amazon for full review but they didn't. They cut the shipping etc charges.,0

"Pires doesn't have a big U.S. following but her Schubert is appealing: The Protuguese pianist Maria Joao Pires has made some winning chamber music recordings on DG (e.g, the Schumann Piano Quintet) and even better sonata recordings with Augustin Dumay as violinist, but I'm not as enthusiastic about her solo work. She gained accolades for her complete Chopin Nocturnes, and this recital of Schubert's great sonata D. 784 and Moments musicaux has the same virutes: sensitive, restrained musicality, a lovely singing line, and complete lack of eccentirity. But that's also the problem: one longs for more dash and flash, more overt personality. After all, Pires is up aginst the likes of Kissin, Edwin Fishcer, and Richter. Being sensitive and pleasant doesn't make you a standout.",1

"Huge, durable & fun: I would highly suggest having the room for this tent as it is huge! I didn't realize it would be so big but I wanted something that would fit my 3 kids and their friends or family that came over to play. My kids have had fun with this tent nonstop since we've put it up, its went from being a fort to becoming a place to sleep at night. I love the idea of having the extra windows on the side to add the tunnels later on if we wish (we need a bigger house for that though).",1
I Loved The Album!: I realy Didn't Care for the album untill I heard it at a friends house. The music is great and the artists picked were great with the songs they had. I totaly loved the album once I heard it. So I had to go and get it and I'm glad I did.,1
"great uprising punk band: FenixTX has tons of potential...it's true. All of their songs are memorable and catchy, most of them sound like they could be hits. They are indeed comparable to Blink 182 in many ways, so this is a great band to check out if you're into Blink 182. Don't just buy this because of their similarities to Blink, FenixTX is a great band that could achieve major popularity with their next cd. This is music that can be appreciated by any punk rock fan and I suggest that you get this if you don't already own it.",1
"DRY ACCOUNT OF FACTS: I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE EXTREMELY DRY AND BORING. IT WAS NOTHING BUT A LIST OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT ANY HINT OF PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF MILITARY EXPERIENCE BY THE AUTHOR.

"I agree with Jamie, Yuck.: This may be one of the worst Peanuts movies ever. What were they thinking? Plodding pace, weird and way too adult plot for what is marketed as a kids movie. When did Peppermint Patty become a vamp? Sheesh, ""I'd like to give you a tumble"". I'm afraid this has become way to common in the last decade. Your kids don't need this and will learn next to nothing about travel or France except classism (as in first class vs. tourist) and how not to allow your kids to interact with strangers. Wander around unsurpervised and Oh, and they also seem to be able to aquire a car on there own, Snoopy drives of course. I don't remember this mean spirited Peanuts gang. Snoopy is off the wall, weird and unreliable. How old are these kids anyway? Pass.",0
"The worst interpretations I have ever heard: I have never heard anyone butcher Rachmaninoff's compositions as terribly as Idil Biret. After listening to her rendition of the Variations on a Theme of Corelli, (which was a colossal failure to say the least) I decided to give her another chance. What a mistake I made. Her phrasing on the first Nocturne absolutely destroys the music, as you can tell she has no ability whatsoever to phrase Romantic style music. The extremely choppy and staccato style is NOT how you play Rachmaninoff. Someone needs to take this woman's piano away from her. If you would like to listen to Rachmaninoff without getting a headache, I highly recommend Santiago Rodriguez, his interpretations are incredible.",0

Vivitar 115MM Zoom Camera: No reliability. Purchased for vacation. 1st day all electronics shut down and would not come on.Replaced with new one(same model 35M 115MM Zoom Camera).

"Wonderful Book: I think this is one of the very best books on drawing I have ever seen. Still one is always searching for inspiration and pretty girls are always a joy to draw.What I love the most is the incredible varity of poses and angles the Artist included in this book. Taking your time and working through the illustrations, a young artist will certainly master the female figure from any point of view s/he could desire. While more experianced draughtsman will find plenty of challenging material here. I took the maid illustration and redrew her as Mirielle Bouquet! I really liked the final drawing.Its wonderful stuff, but It does assume you basically know how to draw. If you are really just learning to draw, I would recommend picking up Drawing on the Rightside of the Brain along with this book. Its simply the best starter ever.",1

It can't get very loud before sounding cheap.The biggest problem that I have with it is that it breaks. About 3 months after continual use, it starts to make this loud buzzing noise. Whenever it gets knocked slightly, starts to play louder, or plays a high bass, the annoying buzzing noise begins.I suggest you to find another speaker set. These are not worth it, will probably break and sound like crap.",0

"Total Cumulative Ascent, NOT.: I am a road cyclist. It is helpful to know a few things about a given ride: the distance, the speeds, and the total cumulative ascent. The total cumulative ascent (TCA) is the summation of the hill climbs for that day. For example, a ride of 100 miles on the flat is a whole lot easier than one of 10,000 feet TCA. I had a Casio watch which readily gave the TCA in 1998, unfortunately it was lost in Italy. I called Casio prior to purchase of a new one and was told that the Casio Pathfinder PAG40B would do the job. The watch does graph the altitude. However, after hours of trying to obtain the TCA using the instruction manual and a phone call to Casio it would appear it cannot be done. It is a shame; it is a good watch otherwise.",0

"Broken in the package: My 3-year-old son loves his Toy State Industries LTD CAT 'bobcat'. The sounds are loud and it has a mute button which is nice. HOWEVER the 'bobcat' wheels seem to be disengaged! I found out from other reviewers that it is supposed to drive forward and back, and this one never did from day one. We can get the bucket to go up and down, but that's it for mobility.You have to destroy the packaging just to get the toy out, so how can you return it with no packaging, especially after your son receives it as a gift and just loves it.We would advise against this company's brand of toys if you expect vehicle mobility and durability. The CAT EXcavator our son has stopped working all together after several days. So far we're out two for two. There are plenty of other less-expensive options for stationary trucks.",0

He enjoys the classroom adventure and the remarkable character traits of all of the teachers especially Mrs Jewls and Mrs Gorf. Those teachers are different and hilarious and the students are even more so. All of the teachers are absolutely funny! Of great interest, at the beginning of the chapters, the character and scenic illustrations really helps to build the interest for my son. What a great idea to begin each chapter with the illustration. You never know what is going to happen at Wayside, it keeps us laughing and wondering about ""what next"" at Wayside School.ohe!",1

"Not a pocket book: I have been to the Louvre before and was overwhelmed with all the great sites to see. So this time I wanted a book to take with me so I could map out what I wanted to be sure and see. This book is very large so there is no way I can take it with me. One reviewer mentioned the organization was great and you could mark off what you see as you go through the museum. That is true the book is organized well and the pictures are great. A map is included in the front and back, but doesn't indicate the top ten must see pieces. The book is so large I will not be taking it with me. Am trying to decide if I should keep for the great pictures or return it. I really wanted to study it on the long flight and carry with me to the museum, but not possible.",0
romance novel masquerading as an historical novel: This book was very disappointing. I expected an historical novel. This book was nothing more than a romance novel. The setting may have been in Mozart's time and general area but there was nothing in the book that really made you feel you were in that time and place.,0
"Great little gadget!: I just got this as a birthday gift from my daughter who knows she has an old techo/geek/nerd mom. Its fabulous! I have so many accounts and get tired of typing stuff in, and now with this, its soooo fast! I love it, managed to get it set up presto fast. I definitely recommend it.",1
"Sooo Funnnnny: My hubby loves this movie. We ordered it on blu-ray and it was delivered in a timely manner. The only problem was that WE DIDN'T GET THE MOVIE! Only the case! I contacted Amazon and they sent a new package right away. We watched it a few days later. The blu-ray works fine, no bumbs in play back great sound quality and at under $10 what better deal is there?!",1
Postcards: These birthday postcards arrived in excellent condition as advertised and arrived before the given date.,1
"NOT WORTH THE MONEY!: Price is good, but cloth surface quickly delaminated from the rubber backing at the edge where my palm and/or arm rests on the pad. Recommend spending 2 - 3 bucks more, and get more for your buck!",0
"Not for serious learner: The whole DVD teaches about 40 very basic words, my 4 year old can learn all that in half day. If you are looking for a movie for your kid, or learn a few words for fun, that's ok, the book and DVD are in good quality. If you want your kid to lean Chinese seriously, go find something else. $50 for 40 words? It's not worthy.",0
"Worked for us...year old habit broken in couple of weeks: We bought this for our 4 year old daughter. She had been biting her nails and sucking the thumb for over an year. We had tried ""Thumb Liquid"" and puts tapes on her fingers, but it not work. The first day we covered the thumb and fingers nails with the solution. She hated it and was vomiting. We then removed it with the nail polish remover at night. The next morning we just put a drop instead of covering the entire nail. We would put this in the day and remove it in the night for the first 3-4 days. After that we would let it stay. It would last for couple of days. Now after couple of weeks, she has stopped biting our sucking the thumb. She would bring it near to her mouth and then stop there. I believe she will stop doing in another couple of weeks.",1
"Poor Quality Item with Even Worse Customer Service: Item arrived with pieces chipped and broken. I tried contacting Vision Decor by live chat, E-mail as well as by phone asking for them to replace the 2 damaged pieces, but no one responded. That was almost a week ago. Shame on you!",0
"Lies! Lies! Lies!: IF you are looking to buy a KARAOKE CD, don't be fooled by the label! This is NOT a real karaoke CD. A real karaoke CD contains files that provide both music and lyrics on-screen. This CD contains two tracks of each song, one with background singers, one without. The lyrics are provided in a booklet format.While we waited for this CD to arrive, our children's expectations were very high. Their disappointment was too sad. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for marketing this as anything more than an audio CD.",0
"Not very good: Yes, it's nice to finally see modern singers make original Disney songs into modern hits. However, most of the songs are bad and dreadful. The only ones I found good were the ones by Ashanti, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Christina Aguilera. The rest are pretty bad. Boy bands? Teen pop girls? Don't think so. Don't think this will be very good. I don't recommend this CD. Get some better music, although I give it 1 extra star for the good songs I mentioned earlier in this review.",0
"Great timer - easy to install - easy to set up: This was the least expensive timer switch I found on Amazon with the programmable latitude/longitude coordinates. It arrived quickly and I had it installed in 5 minutes. The only thing I didn't like was the cheap screws that it includes. The heads are soft so make sure you have a screwdriver that fits well or you'll round off the heads.The instructions were clear and simple. They include lat/long coordinates for major cities, but I got them from Google for my town and that worked too. As soon as I entered the data, the light came on - just like it was supposed to.The switch body is fairly large so make sure you have a full depth switch box that isn't full of wires or it may not fit.",1
"It did not last for me :(: My biggest problem with this product is that the inflatable rubber tube is made from a material that degrades when left outside. I was leaving it by the pool, and in a few months noticed that the tube started leaking air. I tried fixing it by adding the yellow chemical that is used for fixing flat tires in bicycles. But the problem got worse, and then I took off the cover and saw that the whole tube is covered by cracks and there are multiple big holes through the rubber.The second issue is that this tube does not provide enough stability and the kids are able to tip and get stuck with their head in the water.I would never recommend a friend to buy this.",0
"Ordinary People-- Extraordinarily and Intimately Insightful: I closed the final chapter longing for more and feeling as though my friendships had been severed without saying good-bye... What a fine collection of letters to impose such feelings... Not only do we have the opportunity to learn more about this complicated era through their personal accounts, but we get the added dimension of their emotions through the beautifully expressive writing. John Fogarty's soulful poem written during the summer of 1864 underscores the tremendous eloquence of these ""ordinary"" people... Having had the privilege of reading some of Ellis Spear's journal entries as he set off with the 20th Maine, I can affirm the dedication of this teacher to his students and the labor of love the coordination of this project was. We are fortunate to reap what Richard Trimble has sown...",1
"Exceptional: Ever wondered what happens when you drive through a townand you get violently sick and your teeth come out whenyou puke because you breathe the air, unknowingly, killingyourself? Ever think why that woman you just passed didn'thave the two shapely lumps of normal breasts, but one bigbulge? Why did she have no teeth? How come pilots avoid thearea of Haven, Maine. Why did that clocktower's hands lookdrawn on? The mysteries of aliens are faithfully representedin King's great novel, The Tommyknockers!",1
"One of my top 10....: I was blown away by this movie mostly because it was a refreshing break from the typical ""hood"" movie often put out by black directors. The story was intelligent and had a whole different ""vibe"" to it. Long and Tate were superb and more importantly, ""real"". I could definitely relate. I'm a typical guy who doesn't like to get caught up in the ""mushy"" movies, but this boy-meets-girl story is pretty cool. The scene at the end is the bomb. It's sort of like our version of Casablanca. I HIGHLY recommend it.",1
Great Movie for Kids: Great movie for kids! My daughter loves to watch it and sing along. We had this on VHS but it started to mess up and get caught in the player so we purchased this DVD to save her the heart ache of the other one not playing any more :),1
"Avoid this stinker - better albums by McLaughlin abound: I am a big fan of McLaughlin, but this is a 'direct to the bargain bin' release. For acoustic stuff, check out Shakti. For electric stuff, the original Mahavishnu Orchestra (Cobham, Hammer etc) is unequaled. For a dose of something in-between, check out the album where Trilok Gurtu plays percussion.",0
"Excellent product, except...: Beautiful and functional lamp. Love the auto-off during daylight hours, and auto-dim except when someone approaches the porch. However, the dimming feature is not compatible with ""dimmable"" LED lamps. Strangely, it dims, but on bright the lamp has a very objectional flicker. The manufacturer denies any problem on their part, calling the dimmer module state-of-the-art.",1
"Only Need to Read the Last Few Pages: This was the first time I've read a novel by Anita Shreve and it will be the last. The writing was dull and the story simply plodded along. This book was a chore to read. The ""surprise"" ending is contrived and seemed as though the author simply could not figure out how the book should end and pulled a rabbit out of her hat.A disappointing piece of writing and I simply cannot recommend this book to anyone.",0
"not for iphone recharge: I ussed the supplied charging adaptor with my car iphone charger & tried to charge my iphone, but it said that it was not supported.",0
inspirational....: especially for a faw fooder in a cooked world :) as well as those who are interested in adding more raw food to their diet.,1
"Bleh.: This book is cheesy. You'll learn more from ""Light: Science & Magic"" and looking at photos to see what you like, then trying to reconstruct that lighting with the skills you learn in LS&M.",0
"This book is really 'Living Well in Mexico,' 1999.: This book (first published by Muir in 1999 as Living Well in Mexico) was merely OK the first time around, but this version is literally the very same thing, just three years older (it is true that several miniscule changes have been made, for example using ""50"" instead of ""fifty""). Although I read another review saying this was the same book, I must admit I assumed it couldn't be true and ordered it anyway--a mistake! I'm sending it back even though it pains me to pay the postage.",0
"Dreadfull: First of all, I'm NOT belittling her book solely on the reason that she's young. I'm belittling it because it's....well, BAD. It's so corny! The girl can't write to safe her life. It's written in the style of a diary of an 8 year old. Plus, she didn't have much to say. If you want a celeb auto worth reading, I strongly suggest you pick up one of these autos: Drew Barrymore, Britney Spears, Jenny McCarthy. They're all young, but they've got a lot to say about the hell they've gone through their lives. (Or the hard work they went through, in Britney's case.) Everyone can relate to that.Bottom Line: DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!",0
"cool story bad gameplay: I played the Japan version of this game an I think that the story of this game is cool because it fallows the Battle City Episodes.What I didn,t like about this game is how you duel.The dueling is even worst than Dark Duel Stories.At the end of the game the strongest level 4 monster in my deck was the Witch of the black Forest and she doesn't have any effect and you need exp. points to have stronger monsters in your deck.",1
"Completely unusable.: I don't know about all y'all, but these gloves are the worst I've ever put on. The inner liner is not attached to the outer shell, causing movement between the two. But worst of all, the thumbs are WAY too short, created a cramped feeling in the thumb. Add to this the liner issue and they are completely unusable. I've never had issues with gloves and thumb length in the past, so I'm pretty sure it's not a genetic issue. Good luck.",0
OK to Good: It works well for both my big dog AND cat... but my smaller dog doesn't seem to respond no matter how near or far I am to her. At times I would have to get closer to my pets for them to listen to my commands. I would definitely recommend not overusing this tool. Otherwise it works just fine.,1
"JUNK: How this can be called a level one snap together model is beyond me. I bought this for my son, he was really excited when he saw it online. Let me explain how this plane is to be assembled. Step (1) follow the directions very closely, step (2) be very disapointed when the pieces don't stay together, step (3)tell yourself it's worth another try, don't give up , keep trying, step (4) try again, step (5)don't let it get the best of you, pretend it's an exploding airplane. So,to sum it up, if you enjoy disappointing your children, getting frustrated, and wasting your time and money, this is the plane for you.",0
"Brown Rice: Texmati is the best of the brown rice products I have found and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.So far, it has been readily available when I needed it and delivery was fast.When comparing it to my supermarket, I found out that is was also cheaper to buy the pack of four as compared to buying 4 from the supermarket.To get the brand you want for less money is a great discovery and the great customer service is a plus anywhere.",1
"good while it lasted (for my baby): This was a life saver the first 2 months, but then I guess the novety wore off and she began to hate it.The product is portable,lightweight and was the only thing she slept in (but I needed to change the batteries often as my daughter was heavy in weight and needed it on full power to get the full swing.. she was born 11 lbs and used it up until she was 15)I can say I didnt like sliding her under that overhead piece, being it was so low to the ground it was a bit uncomfortable. She did seem too impressed with the lights/music and dangly fishesLike I said though, It was good while it lasted !! With a newborn you would take whatever baby naps you can getBut The battery life (when using it daily as the ""main swing"") is low.. atleast when you are swinging a chunky baby.. I ended up then replacing this on with the nature swing papasan.. she only liked that one for a week!!",1
Outstanding: My first Hoffman and certainly not my last. I thought this book was odd in all the best ways and I loved her style and prose. Outstanding!,1
"The Young Dude needs to be slapped: a 19 year old fruit cake who thinks hes gangsta...hmm....and from what ive read, Mr. Unibrow never bust no gun and never been through what most real gangsters like The Game and Scarface have been through. i think this guy should go back to school and get a real job, especially when that stupid single Gimmie that is pure garbage and the whole album is nothing new. pure trash, dont support this artist, if you really want the album, download it!",0
"This could have been a good game: This appear to be a good game until you reach the level where you have to rescue the journalist. Once you have to rescue that person, the sequence is stupid. It tells a comrade to interrogate the villagers but they shoot them all up and everyone look stupid, not knowing where the journalist at, leaving you stuck.I tried doing a search on the Internet and found other people wanting to know the same thing but no real answer. I'm trading in this garbage for something that was at least went through QA",0
"A Memorable Epic!: Cold Mountain is a beautifully written story about the struggles of two people who hope, against all odds, to reunite with each other. Set in the Blue Ridge Mountains during the Civil War, it is a tragic and emotional tale of a man's will to go on in the harshest of environments and a woman who never gives up hope that one day he will return to her to continue with the life that the war has temporarily stolen from them. The characters are believable, the imagery is beautiful, and the ending is unforgetable. Cold Mountain is a must-read.",1
could be a little louder - but good product: this could have an option to be a little bit louder.... but overall i am happy with the product and am purchasing a second one for our guest bedroom... thanks for all the previous reviews as it helped lead me to the right product...,1
Nice sound: I set these speakers up with the Onkyo TX-SR304B Home Theater Receiver and I just love the sound.,1
"Absolutely Brutal: Despite its short length, this album is definitely worth having if you are a metal fan, hardcore fan, or anything inbetween. The drumming is phenomenal, the guitars are tighter than a 14 year old girl, and the vocals are amazing. I bought this CD the day it came out and I still listen to it over and over again...it never seems to get old.Sadly, Ben and Josh have recently left the band are being replace by James Moorcroft (ex-Blackheart Eulogy) on vocals and Grant (ex-Nightmare Incarnate) on guitar.",1
"The best game anywhere in the world: I have played Scrabble on the train, on planes, in the garden, on the beach, in bars and even in bed. It is the most relaxing/stimulating game that has been invented. We play unconventionally because we cheat and look some words up before putting them down. This is only allowed if you are 99% sure that you are right, but with the proviso that everyone playing has to learn the definition for another time. It broadens the mind and encourages conversation. Some games can last for hours. I love it.",1
"Superb! Superb! Superb!: I've had more fun reading Will Thomas books in the last couple weeks than I have the whole rest of the year. Absolutely terrific. Wonderful writing, intriguing plots, and characters that are so real you'd think they actually existed somewhere, or wish they did. The only problem I have with Will Thomas is his books come out but once a year. Drat!",1
"You will become part of their family!: This is such a special story, one that I never get sick of reading. Steinbeck paints such a vivid picture of the characters that I actually became attached to them. Of all the stories I have read I have never become so distraught at the death of certain characters as I have with this book. The characters are so life-like and you are sure to be able to relate with them, and even know people like them (especially Cathy). Please read this classic, if you do you the characters will become old friends (and enemies) of yours and it will seem as if you are part of their family.",1
"Hilary Sucks!!!: This is one of the worst albums that I've ever heard. Every song sounds the same. Hilary's voice is awful. She can't sing. She should go back to doing t.v. shows and movies. She's just using her fame to do music not because she has musical talent. People like her because they like her in Lizzie Mcguire not because she has musical talent which she doesn't. If you want to hear artists with musical talent check out Britney Spears ""In the zone"" or Christina Aguilera ""Stripped"".",0
Very good drill: I have been using this drill for the last month or so very often for different projects and I am quite happy with it. It is small and powerful. Well balanced. Bits are quick to load. The battery charges fast. I purchased the Titan Quick-Disconnect bits separately so they would fit the drill after reading a review recommending this bit set. The drill bits in this set are bad quality.,1
"POS: I'm not a complainer, but this thing was really a piece of ... junk. It arrived damaged. Amazon wouldn't take it back but they gave me $40 off. It took my husband a looonngg time to assemble, and he's a whiz at stuff like that (Ikea furniture, etc.). I'm just disappointed every time I look at it - save yourself the $ and trouble and buy something else.",0
"lucky he had bjork - 5 stars for her, 0 for the plot: I hated this film, mostly because it made Bjork cry, real Bjork-tears, and it seems to me to be such a waste or something that she poured so much of her heart into that role in what was essentially a silly movie with several extremely flimsy plot constructions, and carried it off with such incongruous beauty when it was all I couldn't quite do to ignore the stupid plot and the wierdass Bollywood musical sequences. The final scenemade me feel ill... At the end I was torn between snapping the movie disc in half and storming out of the house or just sitting on my brown couch in a state of shock. The couch won, dammit.",0
"Not a good introduction: I am a graduate student in Computer Science, this was my first XML book. I think the author digresses a lot. I have read the first 7 chapters without gaining good insight into how I can put XML to use, or write my own DTDs and documents. I won't recommend this books as a first book, if at all.",0
Does exactly what it is supposed to.: Sound quality is not as good as CDs but great for older cars to be able to listen to your iPhone thru the car speakers.,1
"How can you not like this!: What a debut album! People say they sound like Thursday. I personally don't hear the similarity. TBS has a more punk influence to emo while Thursday is emocore. My favorite songs are Bike Scene, Ghost Man on Third, You're So Last Summer, and Head Club. I've read some other peoples reviews on this and they didn't seem to like Head Club, but I sure do. It just rocks! Everytime I listen to it, I just keep making it louder and louder. Trust me, get this album. I love it and I'm sure you will too.",1
"Wonderful, stylish: I love this book and must disagree with another customer who reviewed it saying that obviously the magazine had nothing to do with it. I know one of the featured designers, who confirmed that he was chosen by the magazine editor to appear in the book. And the long bok introduction is written by the editor in chief herself.",1
Broke right after the warranty expired.: This is an extremely unreliable unit. After spending 400.00 the unit lasted only 4 months. The CD will not eject out of the unit and a message appears stating that there is no signal input. I talk to Audiovox and they stated that the unit has failed because of a Video and or software problem. Even though they acknowledge it is their problem they refuse to take care of it. This is now going to cost me an additional 160.00 to have it fixed. So unless you want an aggravating experience and want to spend a total of 560.00 for an unreliable unit I wouldn't waist your money on this.,0
"Don't waste your money on this one: I bought this in Feb 2005 for $7.50 at Target, and the lights went out 6 months later. The whole thing died today. It made good waffles while it lasted, but I'm used to appliances lasting several years, not 10 months.",0
"of course a right wing made this movie.: the director of this movie is a republican (most are not) so, let me say I found this movie racially based and is a conflict of interest. this movie comes right out near the presidential election to change a vote to the right side (dark side)? you betcha! a GOP recommend this movie to me. but, like all political movies it's going to be a biased opinion. just because he comes from a backround of communist. does not mean he is. how so? my family is christian. I am a deist. see! don't pass judgement if you don't want to be judge. therefor this movie is a wash! 4 MORE YEARS!",0
As expected: The product received was as expected. I haven't had the time to use it yet but I do not see why there would be a problem.,1
"Thoroughly enjoyable!: I must admit, I was totally unfamiliar with Keith Urban when I ordered this CD! As a fellow Aussie who likes country I was a little intrigued by a guy who is unknown over here, but managed to make it big in the `States.I have to say, I'm pleased with the purchase!It is a little overproduced, & Keith obviously set out to make a record that would sell, but hey, what's so wrong with that!It's catchy & fun, & Keith has a great voice! I intend buying his other albums on the strength of this one.",1
"GREAT DRAWINGS!: INSIDE THE TITANIC HAD GREAT PICTURES,BUUUUT,IT SHOULD HAVE SHOWN MORE FIGHTING OVER THE BOATS AND PEOPLE THAT WERE FROZZEN.AND ALSO THAT IT HAD A MUMMY ON BOARD.OTHER WISE IT WAS GREAAAAAAT!!!!!!!",1
Not worth the money: This book claims to be written for the expert but wastes most of its content on how to write applications for terminal server. There are perhaps two items of value. The rest of the book meanders through unuseful information for the implementation of Terminal Server. There are better books out there.,0
"THIS BOOK ROCKS: This book was easy to read, I flew through it without even noticing I was near the end, and all the way I enjoyed it.This book has a great ending as well as introduction. READ IT !",1
"Works well, but the charging cord is lousy!!: This product worked well for us; unfortunately, when our baby was around two months old, the power cord for the handheld unit started acting up. It wouldn't power the handheld unit unless the unit was placed JUST SO on a tabletop. We since discarded it and got another one. I'm very unimpressed with this product.",0
"The world is a ""Ship of Fools"": Just excellent. They don't make movies like this anymore and it is a shame.",1
"Don't buy it.......: This the worst netgear product ever, very difficult to connect. After connecting, error with IP assignment. The signal strength was also very bad. My old router has better signal strength (MR614) than this 3..4 generation of router.",0
It irritated me!: Bessman's over use of exclamation points drove me nuts! Joey was tall! They had black hair! They wear leather jackets! See how annoying that is!,0
"Agreed One Disgusting and Degrading Film.: This movie has to be the worst of the Genre, there is no point to it, its disgusting and revolting, it's like a really bad porno, he does this disgusting chubby white girl in the middle of a club, it's gross and has no point. It's not really sticking it to the man if that was what it was intended to do as most similar (related) films are.",0
Too many English lyrics. Not suitable for Spanish inst.: This book seems geared to teachers who know little or no Spanish. I mistakenly bought it as a supplement to my Spanish classes and found that the lyrics were mostly English. The tunes did not fit well with the lyrics.,0
"Good insight in Project Finance: The book gives an interesting insight in Project Finance and is especially valuable for giving the rationale in using PF versus traditional Corporate Finance.It gives evidence of the matter through a step by step procedure so that every case adds some knowledge. Excellent terminology section.For not experienced professional, maybe it should be read in conjunction with some manual providing the basic principle and more insight in financial and legal technicalities.",1
"Absolutely mindblowing book!!: I just got the book yesterday morning and 10 hours later, I am done with Order of the Phoenix. It was amazing!! I don't want to give anything away, but be prepared to cry, laugh, and be very angry with Voldemort. I cannot wait to read it again and again. My favorite part is when Lucius Malfoy gets his due.",1
"Yankee Stadium AND the Politics of New York: This book was very interesting. I loved the way it recounted every detail in history about the stadium. It took you ""behind the scenes"" of New York's politicians and the stadium. It kept me interested. The whole time i felt like i was in New York in the 1920s, it gave me a whole new respect for baseball.",1
"terrible!: I used it for a few days and all I got was a backache! Get an exercise ball and do crunches or the Gaiam ball, or Abdominal straps!",0
"Horrible, horrible, horrrible!: Was this 5.1 mix, mixed by a stoned 60s hippie? 5.1 means 5.1, not 4.0. There is no center channel or subwoofer action. There are parts of the songs that are either completely missing, or not where they should be. Vocals whispering in my rear speakers? WTF? Thankfully my OPPO BDP95 can select to 2 channel, which isn't a big improvement over the regular cd. Maybe the guy who mixed this album should visit the guy who remixed the old Elton John records into SACD 5.1 I know it says on the cover that it was mixed from the old quad tapes, but it shouldn't tell you 5.1 when it is not. And it carries on to the other Moody blues albums also.",0
"I cannot believe they cancelled this show!!!: but I am thankful that they decided to release all the episodes in this dvd set. This was one of the most creative and amusing shows I've seen on tv in a long time and I faithfully watched each aired episode despite Fox's annoying habit of continiously moving it around to different nights and time slots. It must have finally hit the genius network execs over at Fox that they could make money off releasing the dvd set - I was losing hope since they didn't seem bright enough to realize the gem of a show they had in the first place. I'm also happy to note that there really isn't a dumbing down of America like the media would like us to believe. There was a great outcry when this original show was cancelled and it was upper management who thought this program would be too ""smart"" for the average viewer. Maybe they need to get out more and mingle with real people? instead of shoveling crap like ""Swan"" at us.......",1
"Daughter liked this clock: This was purchased as a gift for my daughter who needed a dual alarm clock. It is very similar to one that we had bought locally, but could no longer find. This was shipped directly to my daughter and she loved it.",1
"If you want dark coffee, foregt about this one: This is nice if you prefer lightly brewed coffee......But if you like dark coffee, this is not for you.If you lightly load the filter as directed, the grounds are pushed out of the way when brewing. It doesn't give the water enough time to dissolve the coffee. If you pack it tightly, the water can't push through and you get an incomplete cup of coffee (and a mess when you open the carrier and crap goes flying)We experimented with coarse ground and expresso fine ground mixtures, and get similar results",0
"Has really helped: I had very severe neck and upper back pain, and was having to visit the chiropractor approximately twice a week. Since purchasing this product, I haven't had to go to the chiropractor in over 4 months. It does take a little bit of getting used to, and I think you have to figure out how to make it work for you, but I recommend it. I purchased several other products to help with my neck and back pain, and this is the only one I use regularly (or at all). My only request is that they make a product that extends up through the neck. This one does not.",1
"piece of junk: Balls wax layer is too thin, easy to be scratched. Table brush leaves more dust when you brush the table. Cues' pads are so hard and thin, very slippery when they hit a ball. Spent just a few more dollars and buy descent products. This set is a piece of junk.",0
Over 2 decades!: This is an acquired scent. I was introduced to GF around 1984 and I will always keep a bottle handy (Halston as well).,1
"Poor music, poor story.: The first thing that annoys me of the game is it's music. The game is about the one thousand and one nights arabian stories, and the soundtrack of the game is only one song of rock n' roll (for all the game!!), that has nothing to do with the game and ambientation. It doesn't has any options for changing or turning off the music. I like sonic games, but this one i didn't like.",0
"Still topical though it was published in 1994: Although it was published in 1994, it would still be useful for anyone traveling by rail in Sri Lanka as the railways haven't changed much. Has a fair amount of general information about the country as well.Serious railfans may prefer the encyclopedic ""Railways of Sri Lanka"" by David Hyatt.",1
"A litte disappointed: The 5 probes arrived in a plastic bag (like a ziploc). It looked like someone returned them without the packaging. One probe was broken on arrival, one probe leaks too much water into the plant. The other 3 are working fine so far. It's a good concept but the probe is poor quality.",0
"Do Not use for motors: I just bought the HW2190 Heavy Duty Remote Control for my Dust Control System and it burned up only after 4 uses. It said ""Heavy Duty"" and I assumed it would work to turn on the Vacuum. I can hear it clicking on and off, but no power and no reset. I'm very disappointed.",0
"Not Worth It: This book is a really bad read, although it is short so don't have any regrets. The story line is so badly drawn out from the get-go that I feel like it never really had a chance. They talk up the doctor and his acts the entire book and I feel it builds up to nothing grand by the conclusion.",0
"NO EXIT: The film moves along as if it is a poorly done version of ""No Exit."" A man and a woman are in a prison. They don't know how they got there. There are strange things going on as well as annoying flashbacks. There is also a subplot of a model being interrogated for murder. She attempts to act sexy and cool during the questioning aka Sharon Stone. We also see dead bodies (no faces).As a ""No Exit"" type movie, it was cleverly, but poorly done. I know that is hard to do. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. The acting and dialouge had the poor quality of a soft core film. There were no tense or scary scenes as the scenes change too often with annoying flashbacks to allow it.Now if you thought I gave you a plot spoiler, I didn't as this wasn't a ""No Exit"" film. While the ending tied the movie together, I just shook my head and said, ""You got to be kidding."" The shorter German version was far better. No sex or nudity. Not worth the view.",0
"Awesome CD: The girl has talent. She starting to go back to her roots ,which is a good thing. I definitely recommend buying this cd if you are a fan!!",1
"Do not buy these from Adorama Camera: I bought these from Adorama Camera and they send me something completely different. They send me PAPER labels and not the polyester ones listed. It was not the same packaging or the same item. I notice some other people complained about this as well, so I bet they also bought them from Adorama Camera.If the packaging is not exactly like the one listed, they are not polyester or heat resistant. The polyester labels like the ones listed are wonderful, but make sure to contact the seller to verify they are the exact product listed before buying.",0
great introduction: a truly classic album that has introduced many listeners to the various Cuban rhythms. An excellent (perhaps better) companion is the first album from the Afro-Cuban All-Stars.,1
"not soft: The item was going to be late to arrive, and customer service overnighted it so it would arrive for my trip. BUT. This item is crunchy sounding and not the soft item I have seen in stores, I can live with it but, it was supposed to be a gift for my husband and he hates it.",0
"Sadly not cost effective: Rushhour is CRUCIAL to the satisfactory play of Simcity 4. The game was released as the game, then this Rushhour expansion , then the combination (called SC4 Deluxe). Since the Deluxe version is available in several forms (which include Rushhour) it is just crazy to pay this kind of money for the expansion alone. I don't normally rate things based on cost, but in this case a downgrade is warranted. This rating is for THIS expansion offerYou may want to check out the CD versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition, the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available on STEAM) and though most MAC users run it on Windows emulators, the Aspyr versionSim City 4 Deluxe (Mac). It also is included along with several other games in the box setThe SimCity BoxIt makes no sense to buy this version at this $50ish price.",0
"The Road to the Recycling Center: Paging through this book I bought back in 1999, I realize there are some significant outdated and proven unsuccessful treatments listed in here. I like to donate books I'm finished with to charity, but this one's going straight to the paper recycling center. That's how I will help to improve our toxic world. I couldn't in good conscience let this book out for someone to get a hold of potentially harmful and inaccurate medical information. I'm an advocate of naturally improving our immune systems, but some of the treatments here are unsafe. Other reviews of this book here have noted these dubious treatments, such as intravenous hydrogen peroxide injections, so I need not repeat. Please, just don't buy this book.",0
"Take heed seller, this is why I did not purchase this item: I am in the market for several end tables for nursing homes. This end table fits my needs and budget perfectly. However, Customer Service is most important to me. I would rather pay more for the product to be able to contact the seller when I have a problem, especially if it is a manufactures problem. Because I did not find ONE customer that had something positive to say about the customer service, I did not purchase this item from this company. I wonder how many other sales this customer would have if they only would stand behind their product. PS Sellers better take heed on these comments if they expect to survive.",0
"Greatest Father's Day present.: Love it - it was very easy to set up and it worked perfect from the very first time. If you follow the directions and set it up the way they tell you, it will work perfect. Oregon Scientific makes some very good products.",1
"thumbs down: I am not a fan of this book though it gets rave reviews. There are very few photographs, and it is impossible to use as a plant identification guide. Big thumbs down all around.",0
"Quest for the Inane: I adore Wii. I use the Tennis feature on a regular basis to enhance my exercise regime. By getting lost in the game, I can work up a sweat, and I love deciphering how to improve my skills. So, when I broke my leg, I decided to buy a software that would engage my mind and love of puzzles as an added distraction. Sadly, Zack & Wiki are a great disappointment to me. Now, it might have something to do with my being 60, but I dearly loved Myst and rarely resorted to ""cheat notes"". With Zack and Wiki, I've constantly resorted to ""cheat notes"", because the game dissolves so fast when you make a mistake, that there's little chance of learning from those mistakes. I would absolutely encourage Wii software developers to work on puzzle games because I'd love to find one that ""thinks"" more like I do. I'll bet that as Wii is discovered by broader segments of the market, others will feel the same way.",0
soud ceck: did not know where to send this but the sampling of the disc on your web site is so bad i could not tell from it if i like the disc or not. thank you,0
"Fugly Shoe: This shoe is so ugly i bought it without looking at top view, the look like Bozos shoes when you are walking, the sole is horrendous, makes too much sound and the back of my foot is destroyed. You have been warned.",0
"a movie for juggalos and gore fans: this movie is a great movie ,i first seen it when i rented it and me and my friend was watching the movie and we just loved the action in this movie.some of the good parts are when he blows the aliens brains out of his head with a gun,and the nerdy looking guy jumps threw the aliens head,and theres more but i really dont want to spoil the movie but its a great movie and youll probly laugh and throw up at the same time.well all i got to say is horror movies rule.",1
The worst iron I've ever owned: I paid a lot of money for this iron because i liked the stability that the auto-lift would offer. Little did I know that the iron wouldn't stay hot long enough to iron one dress shirt without starting to spit water instead of steam. I have replaced it with a $30 Black & Decker that I should have bought in the first place. Don't waste your money!,0
"Great purchase: My husband is a huge hockey fan and loves reading this book to our daughter. Some of the references seem a little dated, but that's just my opinion - the book is still creatively written. I'm really glad that we added it to our book collection.",1
"Boring woman, boring book: Talk about comtemplating one's own navel! The narrator of this book is completely self-absorbed. She has no interests, and the greatest interest to the reader is noting how many times ""I"" appears in each paragraph. She seems to yearn for a meaningful connection with another person, but has nothing to offer a relationship. This is definitely someone who needs to ""get a life"". Anita Brookner's prose has been praised to the heavens, but I noted several jarring errors in sentence structure. Her vocabulary is admirable. Although I usually set aside a book that doesn't engage my interest, I seem to be continuing with this one with a kind of horrified compulsion.",0
"These Cowboys Drag Cattle: What is it about tortured artists when they become happy? Can't they make a good album? So RLJ gets married, has a kid, and releases an album of abnormally syrupy tunes. The trobule is listening to ""Love Will Bring Us Back Alive"" is not half as uplifting as ""Chuck E.'s In Love."" She loses her humor, her poetry, and her ambition all in one shot. ""Atlas's marker"" and ""Ghost Train"" are weird enough to like, but the rest of the album is MOR boredom. She redeems herself in later ventures like Pop Pop.",0
"About what you'd expect - only less.: I have always had the suspicion that the far right is a tool of the far left - after skimming (okay, full disclosure: I couldn't read the whole damn thing) this ""book,"" I know now I'm correct.",0
"Unbelievably poor poetry!: When one looks beyond the peurile and rather distasteful content, one finds poetry of the poorest quality. The poems consisted of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic drivel. I was incredulous as to the level of experience the author has, when it comes to writing poetry. In some of the poems Kim attempted to use various metaphors with disasterous results. This book gives very poor value for money and is definitely worth avoiding.",0
"a real downer: Frank Morgan plays Shirley's thieving old grandfather who would cheat his own mother. Every time he is trusted, he betrays that trust and steals again.",0
"james brown: typical jb album;all the songs(except 'regrets',which is why i bought it)are on at least 15 other albums...save your money!",0
"Life, It's Trials Included: This book is great! I love it and would even say that it is my favorite book. It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life. It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls. The book is set around the 1800s and includes all the prides,joys, fashions and styles of this time. I recomend that you read it. I know I enjoyed the descriptive tale of Little Women.",1
"What happened????: I loved the early Scarpetta books, and I've read everything that Ms. Cornwell has published. I found ""Predator"" very disappointing.The charm of the earlier books was that they were told in Scarpetta's own voice and we were able to share her feelings and thoughts. Since Ms. Cornwell shifted to a third-person storytelling style, the charm has gone and Scarpetta has much less depth.With the loss of this insight, the books have become the same as any other piece of crime fiction.I understand that it's important for an author to change styles and topics occasionally to keep things fresh, but I wish that Ms. Cornwell had dropped these great characters entirely, rather than turning them into the vaguest shadows of their former selves.",0
"Couldn't get into it: I loved Ann-Marie MacDonald's debut, Fall on Your Knees. I was so excited about reading The Way The Crow Flies. What a disappointment. I gave it my ""100-page effort"" and gave up on page 101. Nothing about this book intrigued me. I didn't care about the characters. The enticing opening blurb about a girl's death wasn't enticement enough to keep reading.I had so hoped that this would be a great book, but I simply didn't care for it.",0
"Hatebreed evolve and its great!: Was I the only person thinking Hatebreed were starting to get boring and put out songs which were simply too similar. I bought the Rise of Brutality out of the blue one day and liked it but it had a rather short life span in my cd player. Then I read that the latest offering from them was very stong and decided to take a chance with it and I was pleasantly surprised! Hatebreed have changed ever so slightly and aren't quite as repeatitive as they once were. For anyone that previously had given up on them I say just give this album a chance. I really enjoyed it from start to finish! But don't worry, they are still as hard hitting and agressive as ever!",1
"commitments vol2: Not as good as the original ( not volume 2 )If you want to hear music featured throughout the movieget the cd titled just ""The Commitments""",0
"OUTSTANDING: I bought this book for my wife and she loved it, read it in 2 days. This is a must read book and the part 2 which is called ""Aftermath""",1
"S Club Break-Out: Never Had a Dream Come True has become the US break-out hit for the vibrant British 7 peice, and for very good reason. This is a beautifully crafted pop song, and one of the best songs in the Club's playlist. When Two In A Million & Natural failed to make them the popstars they are around the world, I was a bit fearful that they would join the defeated liked of Westlife, Billie, and Boyzone and leave us entirely, but radio picked up on NHADCT, and the rest is history. This was the bands second UK number one, following a while after Bring It All Back, and prior to disco jam Don't Stop Movin'. Also contained was the previously exclusive to the British 7 album Spiritual Love, a smooth R&B jam which is a cover of the old Urban Species song. An amazing, moving, feel good, romantic pop tune, do yourself good and pick up a copy.",1
"I usually like Melissa and Doug toys, but...: I unwrapped this for my daughter and within minutes the labels on the magnets were falling off. Instead of letting her play with them right away, I had to go through all of them and glue the labels on that were falling off. Very disappointing. I usually don't have these issues with Melissa and Doug toys.",0
"great product: I am somewhat sensitive to PI and poison oak -- if I brush up against it I will get a rash, but I don't think I've gotten a rash from indirect contact with it. I am also an avid trail runner.Last year I borrowed some Ivy Block from a friend before setting out on a trail run, and covered myself with the stuff. I had a pretty horrid accident where I tripped on a tree root, fell off a small cliff, and went rolling down a poison ivy-covered embankment. I was pretty messed up: twisted my knee, got some lovely bruises, and got a horrendous gouge taken out of my forearm. But I did not have a single speck of PI rash.I now go through this stuff like I go through sunblock. Haven't gotten PI since.",1
"Great signal splitter/amplifier: Works exactly as I hoped. No distortion of video signal or sound. Just plugged it in, hooked it up and forgot about it. Wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",1
"The Bad Reviews are Right!: I made the mistake of not listening to the bad reviews.These hooks are junk. They are small, poorly put together, and have magnets so weak that they cannot hold a small keychain.I thew them in the garbage and cursed the company that cheated me. Unfortunately I don't have time to bother trying to get a refund on a $7 product.But I do have time to WARN OTHERS!",0
"So good.: This book is a great way to get a very important message to your children..without boring them. God's not finished with us yet! He began a good work in us and He will finish it!I love this book, it even spoke to me, and My 5 yr old loved it so much we went out and bought the DVD. Lucado is so articulate in his ""adult"" books but he does the same with his children books, they are all wonderful and have a timeless message for our future generation, and for us as well! Now hurry up and add it to your cart! Trust me, the price can't be beat for such a great story.",1
"Dazed and confused: A Clockwork orange is a good choice for reading material if you have a lot of time and you feel like reading a book twice. I was very confused all through this book. It is not something that I would read again. I didn't care for the language, I found that it made it very difficult to understand and follow. The message of the book is sort of good. The people really want to help Alex but the way they go about it can be debated. Some people i'm sure will love this book, but I have found that this book wasn't for me.",0
"A lot of writing: A lot of writing and very little knowledge or input from the Author on the subject.. If you like writing, this is the book for you~!",0
"Whatever you do do it with love: You can read this booklet in less than a sitting. It has some interesting things that you can learn about but as TL said: every woman is different and you have to know what she likes and she has to know what you like. So I can tell you that if you are talkative with your partner you could try it but I'm sure that is not as the book says: that every woman can try this, that's not possible.",1
doesn't get better than this: this is a great collection of John Wayne! The cowboy is just as good as when i saw it as a boy. Men were men enven when they were just boys......,1
Quite happy with it: This is a lot like watering my plants. Must remember to take care of this pretty often. We have an outside wood burning furnace and our heat is pretty dry but it seems to do the job it is made for.,1
"put branda to shame: though this song have really cloying lyrics, but mariah sang with a 80s nostalgia feel and 90s cool. a superb way to express the song!",1
"Not bad...: Its not high quality but it does the job. its made of lightweight plastic and seems like it could break easily, but if your using it for a laptop or schoolwork it beats having to use your lap. Its also has a raised tab at the bottom to keep stuff from sliding off, if your labtop doesn't have rubber cushions on the bottom of it it could slide off the smooth surface of the table. For the price its not bad.",1
MTX is a great motorcyle game: this game is great ist easy to controll your bike and create trix.its fun as you start a career and earn money and new bikes to make it to the top.,1
Review of recent DVD: The video came through in excellent shape and in good time.I am enjoying it.Thank you,1
Her best cd..........: This is her first cd. This is her greatest work because the production was more sensual. Chapter 2 was a big mistake after hearing that i could have sworn it was the wrong version or something. That ole skool thing was not cool dont ever try that again with your album Ashanti. STOP SAMPLING EVERYONE ELSES MUSIC........,1
"Spiffy as a blue duck: I first read this in 3rd grade, and then after that I couldn't find it again. One day while looking for books to read on a trip, I came across it and I just had to have it! This is my favorite book and I must have read it about 5 times, but it's still just as good every time I pick it up. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to read.",1
"Wonderful book!: My toddler LOVES books. You can't get her away from them-and this one is one of her favorites. It has lots of things to do throughout the pages-a rattle attached with velcro to shake, to sections to practice separating and reconnecting (also with velcro), a horn to squeak, and an elephant's tail to lift. She has been able to sit looking through this book for minutes! since she was just 6 or 7 months old-it really holds her attention. I highly recommend this book!",1
A good buy: This was the least expensive of the available editions. It was excellent as the print was large making it easy to read.It is a classic book and was well presented.,1
"It's great... The only thing is, it is a little under powered.: It is a great little frother. I use it to make my wife hot coco and I find it a little under powered. It doesn't take much to stop the unit.I would buy it again, but I would still wish it had more power.",1
Best Gift: I bought this for my mother because she was looking for something that would heat enough water for guests. She absolutely loves the qt size and uses it on a daily basis.,1
"Very good product, but a little over priced.: Aside from this being over priced, I absolutely LOVED this product. I used it after a shower to soften my facial hair and head for shaving (I like the clean look). At first, it warms up quickly - which is incredible... but then it fades leaving a nice slick layer to shave on. I will be buying this product again and I would recommend it to my friends.",1
"An Intimate Portrait of Hemingway: An intimate portrait of Hemingway 'the man' is painted by this book. With details to his domestic life and loves, female, feline and otherwise we glimpse the very human side of this prolific writer who profiled others so well. Regrettably, the quality of the photographs in this book are overall very poor, taking away from the well written text. For Hemingway aficionado's it's a must read.",1
Hotties: i love the cd it's the best i love all the songs. i first heard about them when i watched there concert on Disney that was so awsome. they have the best dance moves i rate thier dancing a 10 along with Nsync,1
Just finished my first half marathon: Great book - filled with lots of great advice given with a dose of humor. I've read this cover to cover twice and I just finished my first half marathon last weekend - with a full planned in a few months.Thanks John and Jenny.,1
Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Blades: This is the best price I could find anywhere. Blades are new and not chinese copies.,1
"BT is a genious: When I first got this record from my friend as a gift, I thought this was going to be some lame upbeat dance song. Believe me when I say this the moment the record started to spin, I fell in love with Bt's music. He is a genious, and needs to be thanked. This song pumps up the atmosphere of your party to the acme. Get this record and any other record by BT.",1
I think this is great!: My four year old likes to talk to strangers. I've talked to her but she just loves people. I think this has been a good tool to help teach her.,1
"Excellent Fairy Tale from West Africa!: This is a folk tale from West Africa. As a teacher, I would highly suggest it when working on a unit of multi-cultural literature. The story is circular, and offers an opportunity to explore cause and effect. Beautifully illustrated, and unique in it's writing style, I would recommend it to children from 1st to 3rd grade!",1
"Fast and Sturdy Waffle Maker: PROS:Cooks very fast!Sturdy and heavy construction (especially when compared to the brands available at Target and Walmart).Beeps when the waffle is done.Nonstick finish actually works and seems very durable.Small footprint and convenient cord wrapMakes perfectly cooked waffles.CON:The printed ""doneness"" settings wear off very easily when wiping off the waffle maker.OTHER:For the BEST waffles, you should useGolden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)",1
"Didn't know to laugh or to cry: Franken takes a fairly straightforward approach to dissecting and refuting the right wing's attacks on moderates and centrists (c'mon, there aren't any true liberals left in washington). He exposes Hannity, Coulter and others for their blatant lack of honesty and sloppy techniques.Thanks to Fox, he's riding this one to the bank.BTW - If Fox is so concerned about trademark protection, how come every friday I hear Hannity say ""if it's friday, it must be Miller Time..."". Seems to me, the beer folks have the TM on that phrase.Only criticism is that some of the points he makes are nitpicks. There are enough compelling arguments in the book that he could have left out the more ambiguous ones, which will just leave the right a place for their arguments.",1
"Malena the most sexy and the Ragasso in love.: This is a excelent movie, excelent acting,beatifull scenography and vestuary as well. The story is so original that capture the attention of anybody. It is realistic that inspires the viewer to see life with the real taste of love for someone without any interest but the happiness for that person. Malena is the beatifull woman that becomes live by this excelent actress, she represents the suffering of being a ""bella"" but not having any hate for the people who made her suffer. I recommed this movie for yourself and also as a gift.",1
"Family fun!: Avatar is great for all ages! My 2 year old enjoys watching it as much as my husband and I do, and everyone in between. The only downfall is how few episodes were released on the DVD. So, I'm sure I'll be purchasing the next one soon!",1
"A great book: This is the second book I've read by this author, and technically I bought it on a whim online. Not sure if it was fate but I really enjoyed this book, the pacing was great and the banter between Nigel and Felicity was sharp and witty and laugh out loud in some spots. Ms. Alexander created two very strong and well drawn characters and that is what really makes this book stand out.",1
"Tamia is on top of her game!: I have always loved Tamia since her debut. This CD shows and proves that this girl still has what it takes. Great vocals and a nice mix of uptempo songs and ballads! There are a few songs on here that just don't seem to fit on here but the rest makes up for those.Standout tracks on here are: ""Mr. Cool"" (a fun upbeat song), ""On My Way"", ""Still"" (a good slower song). The BEST song on here is the slow, ballad: ""Tomorrow"" - Tamia's vocals are on point with this track. It is such a good song.For any Tamia fan: You should own this. For anyone who is looking to explore good R&B; mixed with a bit of hip-hop this is for you!",1
"Great Mind Twister: Two great actors, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. To me it was a real thinking film, as well as having plenty of action and suspense. It had me on the edge of my seat. I have recommended this film to several people.",1
