"Reference Yes, Learning or Instruction No: I purchased this book because the customer reviews were fairly positive. But this book is a lot like going on a scavenger hunt. Information is scattered throughout and it is your job to find it. For example, the term ""threads"" is referred to quite often early on but they don't define this term until midway through the book. I found myself jumping all over the place for either a definition or explanation.",0
NO!!!!!!I will give it 1 star.: This doll is not beautiful.The american Idol collection is the worst.Cali Girl is too.I don`t want to buy it.I am so sorry!!!!!,0
"Neat Features/Uncomfortable: I bought this with a very hopeful attitude after reading the other reviews. Had tested a number of backpacks loaded with various weights and even gotten helpful hints on adjusting at a store. This pack came with some nice features: separate sleeping bag compartment, lots of compartments, decent size for class, built in rain fly, places to attach things. However, there's a point where the shoulder pads attach to the bag that is a big uncomfortable knot in my shoulders. Also, no matter how I adjusted for height, the pack felt like it was pulling me backward at the shoulders, not shifting weight to the hip belt. I had to send it back and replace it with one at twice the cost. I was sad, because it's nifty for all the features. If you're new, please make sure you get good advice and know how one should fit before you try this one on - that way, you'll be able to make a good decision.",0
"Progressive-Underground divas??? where's the vocal?: Not sure what made them decide this should be the subtitle for this compilation. As usual, Roland Belmares knows good dance music, but the vocal tracks are only sporadic, and while they're good tracks, it's just a surprise to find so many non-vocal tracks. Track 1 is a full Sandy B vocal track, as is Loleatta's club hit. Helpless by Sky Box is a pretty good vocal track that samples ""Don't You Want Me"" by Human League. But for the most part, we're given only an occasional vocal sample. Time listing:1. Nothingness (9:03)2. Filters (7:15)3. What comes around goes around (6:22)4. Give the DJ a break (5:50)5. Music for the masses (6:56)6. Sexy (6:54)7. Helpless (5:13)8. Don't hold back (7:06)9. Give me more (6:09)10. nova pain (5:55)11. you're beautiful (6:15)",1
"The theif who stole a week.: What a stinker! I loved Richard Steinberg's first novel, The Gemini Man. The concept was great and the writing was superb. His sophomore effort, however, leaves much to be desired. The story timeline jumps rapidly from one point in time to another a few months away. Apparently, everything that happens in between is insignificant and only needs be recapped. This ""time-warp"" effect slows down the pace of the novel in that the reader now has to read a ""re-cap chapter"". Also, the overall driving secret of the novel is not really that great. It's been done before. And done and done and done and done and done. Overall, this book is mediocre at best. Richard Steinberg should stick to covert-ops style books like The Gemini Man and The 4 Phase Man. Both of those novels were significantly better than this. I highly recommend those and highly recommend you stay away from Nobody's Safe.",0
"This movie was terrible!: When I subjected myself to watching this movie, I had seven friends with me. By the end of the movie, there were two of us left. The flashbacks were awful, the effects were wretched, and the acting? How good can a movie starring Norm from Cheers and Bull from Night Court actually be? If you voluntarily watch this movie, you are either: a)a stupid college student like me or b)really, really, desperate for any form of entertainment.",0
I love wood: I have a few in-laws who benfited from this book. When I showed them the book of 2 x 4's. It fit their bill cheap inexpensive and beautiful.,1
"Lets me use my own coffee, save K-Cups, and be more green: I was so happy to get the Keurig machine, as we have a few at work, and I like the temperature the coffee comes out at. Even better, as I was using many K-Cups at home, when I found this reusable filter on Amazon. Some of the reviews had me worried that I was going to have a cup of coffee with many grounds at the bottom of the cup, but when the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter finally arrived I made a cup and was very pleased with the results. I usually grind my coffee pretty coarsely, so there were no problems such as the bottom of the cup being full of coffee grinds. I just didn't understand the directions in the package saying that the K-Cup filter holds 2-3 tablespoons of ground coffee; I could only get 2-3 teaspoons in.I'm curious to see how long this will last. Some reviewers have said that the filter doesn't last too long, I'll have to put it through its usual paces before I can say.",1
"Good for study purposes: When I first opened the box after purchasing these cards, my first reaction was disappointment. As mentioned so many times before, the size is just not practical for a Tarot deck. The print on these cards is not very good at all, the images are very pixellated. Sure they are small cards, but for a retail venture I would expect better quality print.I did find one good use for these cards, they are good to use while studying and learning the Tarot. They can be taken places that might be difficult to take a full size deck, or you can tape them inside the pages of your Tarot study notebook for quick reference of the card image.I understand the draw to smaller size Tarot cards, but if you want a deck that you can actually use for reading, look elsewhere. These are just too tiny.",0
"Great for Beadweaving!: I copy portions of works of art from the Great Masters and turn them into Jewelryor amulet bags.All I needed was the loom. I bought suitable thread and size 15/0 beads for my work separately.I can imagine it being super easy with larger beads.Being portable, this loom is perfect for me.",1
gifts for people: this was a gift. i can not review all of the cd's that i got from you people. i can say you people are great. the order was here before christmas except for ozzie. that came 5 days before christmas and it needed to be shipped as well. other than that i will still keep on buying from you people.thank u.,0

"Truly Wonderful: Cussler continues to astound with depth of characterization, plot realization, and melodic prose. The Pitt Saga is a gem of American literature and Cussler a true Master.",1
"Africa de mi coraz√≥n: Does anyone know where one can purchase the series ""WILD AT HEART"" with Stephen Tompkinson in Spanish? V-ME, which is the Spanish channel of PBS, is currently showing it with the name ""AFRICA DE MI CORAZON."" I have seen it in English and am now enjoying it in Spanish. It is too good not to share.Thank you.",1
"good, but i need help: joey the passion is a great game, it was tons of things to do and some good cards,but i was wondering if anyone out there knew of a place that i can use the battle.LAN stuff i got from the other reviewer who talked about battle.LAN, i went to that site and it had nothing to do with yu-gi-oh, so does anyone know of a place i can battle over the internet, if so, IM me at: brandnewbuddy60, or leave an e-mail at: lbplayer60@yahoo.com, or leave a message here,other wise i would say that any yu-gi-oh fan should buy this game,the only thing i didnt like was that some of the things joey says get really old, really fast, but other wise a good game",1
Turntable with Audio recording software: The purchase was a joke on me. The turntable turns and thats about as far as it went. The cartridge came without a needle and the software SOUNDSOAP for the MAC was obviously not for the MAC and would not install no matter what I did. AUDACITY did not come with it but I have sinc downloaded it.,0
"Very poorly written, ""assembly line"" book: I have found other books in the Que Special Edition series to be very useful. This one has thorough coverage of the topic, but is extremely poorly written. The author's careless use of terminology, poor choice of examples, and lack of clear definitions and explanations makes what should be fairly simple subjects very difficult.I was hoping to use excerpts from this book to supplement the text in a class I am teaching, but it is completely unsuitable.I am very disappointed that the editors at Que did not do any kind of quality control on this. I guess they are just concerned with getting books on the hot topics cranked out. I will hesitate to buy any Que Special Edition book after this experience.",0
"Tired, immature, and completely ill-prepared: This booklet is nothing more than someone who lacks the insight to really understand the cultural, political, and spiritual aspects of black hair and hairlocking. HAIRLOCKING IS NOT A FAD! We have to explore why OUR people are afraid of wearing afros, cornrows, braids, and locks. The book needed to explore the holistic impact of hairlocking or natural hairstyles in general. This booklet is a signal that more SERIOUS research is needed into our culture BEYOND the Bible, Qur'an, and Torah",0
"Husband Gerald Brenan would have done better: For anyone interested in the experience of an expatriate in a Spanish village for a short time after the start of the civil war this book is OK, as long as we note there were many thousands of villages or pueblos across Spain, the war straddled the whole country, and the writer left for safety only a few months after the war started. notably before Franco's Nationalists took nearly Malaga and commenced an enormous slaughter of their republican enemies, the Loyalists, in early 1937; an event about which there is not a word. There is equally strong praise for the things the auther was pleased by and condemnation of the others. The excessiveness of both put me off. The writing is most moving in parts, but the work is unstrucutured. The author was really a poet, and it tells. The works of her esteemed husband,commencing with The Spanish Labyrinth, are a far better investment of time and money.",0
"more of a clash than a flow: Ok so as almost every one else has mentioned the Beach ,I am not . I could see exactly where he wanted this book to go and in what format to do it , but this ,unfortunately did not happen . He tries to give a compasionate edge to the characters by explaining phases of there life. For example Jojo - where was that all going ? and again Alfredo , what was the over all reason in him apart from a tool to give us a greater insight into the street kids life and thoughts . When Alfredo's tool like job is done he is quickly dropped . He was trying to make the reader empathise with the characters and wasted a rather lot of time trying to do so. The nice touches where when the different story lines clashed and characters interacted .However this did not happen very often and when it did it was rather brief . Ending on a more positive note I still believe that Garland has the skill to do much better than this and eventually do so .",0
"Good Survey, But Now Dated: (First of all, it should be pointed out that ""Native American"" in the title does not refer to indigenous inhabitants, the book was written before that term had come into use. It refers to anarchism that had not been imported from elsewhere.) This gives a good summary of several different anarchist traditions in America, starting with antinomianism among colonials and later religious non-resistants, up to the anarcho-individualists like Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. The last chapter compares them with the imported anarcho-communism of Emma Goldman etc. The book is short and treatment is often summary, but it makes a good introductory guide.",1
"Processer hopelessly slow: GPS systems are great! This one, however, is hopelesslyunderpowered. Frequently, when needing directions, thesystem was busy refreshing its graphical display.So I had to take a guess. When the guess was wrong, thesystem would realize I am ""off route"" and start searchingfor a new route. During this time (20 sec??), I would likelyfail to anticipate the correct route - so when thesuper-slow search algorithm finally returned with a route,it immediately realized I was off route again. And again.You get the picture? It's painful to purchase a unit forserious money just to find out that the manufacturer saves [money] on a decent microprocessor.It's a great unit for patient people (and people who arebrave enough to stop on highways!). When its screen isupdated, it gives great advice!",0
Choppy Story. Story is a bitch to follow. Poor character development.: Lewis is one hell of an actor or after seeing lincoln maybe he isn't acting or it's easy. It's really hard to understand the conflict or maybe they are all just nuts. There are little lines that give you a hint but this is dark and boring. I kept waiting for the punch line. Anyway don't waste your time for this slow to neveer developing story......,0
"Marred by Burton's Obsession With Psychology: Visually, this film is wonderful, and it has many fine moments, right up until the very end.In the novel and in the original film, Wonka sees and appreciates Charlie's good heart and his love of family. When Charlie wins, he excitedly invites both Charlie and his family to live with him, no questions asked.The whole point of the original novel and movie is to show Charlie's big heartedness.True to form, Burton throws in his own dark, twisted touch; he gets hung up on the idea of Wonka as a socially maladjusted wierdo. In Burton's vision, Wonka can't comprehend Charlie's love of family.The story isn't supposed to be about Wonka, but about Charlie's big heart.",0
"Book Fine, Wrong Edition...My Fault: The book was perfect. It was in good condition and packaged well. However it was nearly two weeks late due to problems with a backorder of the book. Plus, there was no picture of the book online, which had some hand in the ordering of the wrong edition. I don't blame Amazon.com for sending the wrong edition, because I clearly ordered it. However, I wish there would have been a picture to see the cover of the book or more description of the item on the website.",0

Their website is completely useless. I've tried the easy, automatic way, and the manual method. Both methods result in lockup. My computer never used to lockup!

"Emotionally Relatable: In this inspiring novel, author Christina Adams shares the true story of her pursuit to provide every opportunity to help her son Jonah progress and excel the beyond the expectations of his diagnosis of autism. With her heartfelt openness of the challenges and victories of early intervention, Christina eloquently relates to the lives of many parents of children on the autism spectrum. As with many true stories and families, this account is unique and cannot be generalized to every family or circumstance; however, the underlying emotions that a parent experiences when discovering their son or daughter have been diagnosed on the spectrum remain relatable.",1
A Glorious Rendition of American Patriotic: Simply a grand performance by David Osborne! An excellent and enliveningCD! I recommend it for anyone wanting a patriotic musical treat!,1
"Great album!: I got to listen to Julio's album for the first time a couple of years a go and I must say that to listen to his music is still a pleasure. I can't understand the lyrics since I don't speak Spanish but I can tell that there is a lot of passion within them, and that's what I love the most about it. ... I truly recommend the album.",1
"Got hanky?: Women's fiction isn't my usual read but this book kept me just as riveted as the suspense novels I love so well.I would say Ms. Meissner's strong suit is story and characters. So many books are well written but the story is ho-hum. Not this book--I HAD to know what happened to these characters. Through her pen, Susan made them live and breathe.Read this with a warning: Tears will be shed, (yes, that means yours.)A Window to the World is an emotional story of love, loss and hope. An ideal book for best-friends or sisters to read together.",1
"an edition to be avoided: Great war film but a very disapointing copy: very poor quality of both sound and image. This edition (with no name of film editor on the DVD and whose image on the box does not match the one put on the internet site of amazon) is to be avoided absolutlely: it is no more than a sort of ""pirat quality"" copy. A. De Toth and his great filming deserve much better.",0
"plot holes you could drive a cat-bus through: This is that rare beast.... a dreadful Ghibli film. No saving graces beyond the usual lovely artwork, but the story was beyond uninspired. I fear that they've caught the Disney 'dumbed down but lovely' bug. If you love Ghibli, avoid this one and spend the time watching Spirited Away again.",0
"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!: Do not believe the synopsis of this film! The word ""dispensationalism"" isn't even spoken until the last 2 minutes of the film! This is nothing but an attack on Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventist, etc. And if you're not sure what a cult is, they spend a bunch of time defining that. I am a Christian that worships in the Presbyterian church. So I am not here to defend the churches listed above or even make a judgment for or against them. My point, though, is that I purchased this movie on Amazon Prime Videos because I thought there was going to be an educated discussion about the history and error of dispensationalism - just as the film was promoted. And it is not that! Why they chose to link these above churches with this movement, I cannot figure! Nowhere can I find these churches as being the historical source of dispensationalism. So, again, don't waste your money!",0
"Not thrilled.: The premise was very interesting -- a woman put together out of the bodies of others -- but where Antieau takes this idea makes little connection with the idea itself. She quickly turns the story into a piece of feminist and New Age propaganda, harking back to an age of serenity when all women and men (clearly in that order) lived in peace and harmony with Mother Goddess Earth. There is no real plot, with what conflict there is (with the dark rapist/incestuous Father Lee) being all dull and predictable and wrapped up in a neat, tiny package at the end.Antieau's word-smithing style also irritated me. She writes in short, choppy sentences, which are regularly not even full sentences. It's like reading Hemingway but with his powerful vision condemned to a utopian New Ageism. On the other hand her choice of words can often evoke powerful imagery, but I found this redeeming feature to be drowned by the rest of the book's lackluster performance.Not recommended.",0
My Kindle: I love my Kindle!!!! I tell everyone I see reading a book how awesome it is. I get a lot of questions when I am in public and have my Kindle out. I know of 4 people that have purchased the Kindle after seeing mine.The wireless downloading of books makes the Kindle superior to all other e-readers. I highly recommend the Kindle to all book lovers.,1
disappointed: I just received my Porter-Cable Robotoolz RT-3620-2K Rotating Laser System. The rotating laser visibly wobbles. I am in the process of investigating the return policy right now.,0
"Piece o' Junk: Accidently stumbled into this at amazon. I had purchased one of these myself because it seemed like the perfect temperature measuring product. I had the same problems with both the food and oven temperatures being WAY, WAY out of wack. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you can see if the sensors work and if they don't take it back right away.In fairness to Poulder, they usually have a top notch thermometer and have traditionally been my favorite. They have just botched this one BIG TIME.If Poulder reads these for product feed back, here's an idea that would sell like hot-cakes. Fix this rig so it works. That's step one. Step two: make one that transmits a signal to a receiver that can be read in another room. (I have one and it works great)",0
It works.: Good program. Good price. On time delivery. Didn't have to use gas and waste time going to the store to pick it up.,1
Terrible design flaws: We have owned 4 cup coffee makers from Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker.I bought this coffee maker because I thought that it was more attractive on our granite counter tops. Do NOT buy this coffee maker for any reason! It is almost impossible to pour the coffee without spilling it. The pour spout is flat. What were they thinking? You need to use your nails to pry the lid off the carafe. Stupid design all around. It barely holds enough water to make coffee for 2 mugs. It is hard to fill compared to the other brands. It takes twice as long to brew a pot. The claim that you can interrupt the cycle to pour a cup is false. It keeps brewing and sputtering. Messy and slow. I'm going back to the less expensive Mr. Coffee. Better design and more features such as delayed brewing.,0
"ANYTHING BETTER I WON`T READ IT!: LET ME GIVE YOU AN ADVICE, IF YOU WANT TO KEEP READING FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK, IT WILL PREVAIL IN YOUR MIND AS THE LAST BOOK YOU`VE READ, SUPERIOR QUALITY AND ULTRA-DETAILED PANORAMA, I READ THIS BOOK ON MY TRIP TO EUROPE, WHERE THE STORY DEVELOPES, SO THIS MADE IT A-REAL-LIFE-JOURNEY. SIMPLY THE BEST OF ALLAN",1
"This album changed my life: I remember listening to this over and over again as a kid starting at 5 years old. Woe to me if my big brother caught me playing his records (he was afraid I'd scratch them). But at least my brother was generous and played this album a lot. As a little kid, some of these songs really frightened me (The Bat, He Never Came Back, Exploration in Terror), but I grew to love the whole thing. This record was a big reason why I got into being a musician in later years and took up the drums (and writing original stuff on keys) and having a moderately successful carreer doing soundtracks. I don't think there is any other album from the 60's as wacky and as experimental as this. This is the Ventures really pushing their boundaries and coming up with amazing sounds (done all on guitars - as they stress in the liner notes). This is a great example of incredible 60's guitar albums. I think it's downright historic. It was also Keith Moon's favorite record.",1
have owned for over 5 years: We purchased an earlier version of this item and it started right up and worked fine out of the box. Then some time passed -- by the time it was two years old the rubber components were crumbling and cracking. I put gas in and it leaked back out. The gas lines had cracked and needed replacing. After replacing all the lines and putting in a new spark plug it started right up. However after a couple tanks of gas the plug would need replacing again. In the future I'll avoid this brand as well as other similar cheaply made products.,0
"Not too good!: Now don't get me wrong. It was as enjoyable as any other mediocre comic book, but not worth the money. Read the 'Death of Superman' et al series if you really want to see Clark die! ...and die he does!",0
"Sound quality is poor and there is too much static.: I purchased 2 of these headphones. One for myself and another as a present. The first one I opened and tried out, the static was bad. I thought maybe the one I opened was damaged. The 2nd one was just as bad on the static. I bought myself a pair for when I run on the treadmill. As soon as the treadmill turns on, the static gets so bad you can no longer hear the TV. I had to return both of them.",0
"Addicting non-fiction: My mom had this book in the basement, with her hundred other Ann Rule books. After hearing her rave all the time about this author, I decided I'd ignore it. How great can it be if my *mother* likes it?? Boy, was I wrong. I picked it up, ready 20 pages, and couldn't put it down for two days until I was finished. I almost forgot to eat. It's that good.",1
"Definitely the best pick: I bought this phone set 5 months ago and have been very happy with it. I wanted a wireless phone set with high clarity sound, was expandable (one handset for the home office and one other for general use), had caller ID waiting and speaker capability on handsets as well as the base, and could handle the range (for use outside). I did not want an answering machine because I have a smart fax that serves that purpose already. This phone set has exceeded my needs. I like having the capability of unique phone lists for each phone, too (numbers for customers on my office handset and family/friends on my general use handset). I can walk all the way to my back fence and the person on the other line says I am crystal clear even on the speakerphone (they are clear as well - clean sound). It would be nice if the caller ID didn't stack up with same name callers (vs. depicting one entry with the number of times they called). Overall, I highly recommend this product.",1
"Poor Paper: I'm sorry. I just don't understand the good reviews about this paper. Granted, it is very cheap, but it doesn't hold ink well at all, and the colors appear dull and lifeless. The ink smears all over the paper, and causes a rippled effect because of the poor and thin texture of the paper. It might be useful for just simple black and white graphics, but anything with full color is unusable. I purchased this paper to use for a 2-sided brochure that I had designed, and it is AWFUL. The colors are dull, they bleed, and there is no way you can print it 2-sided.....the paper is too thin to go through a printer twice. It simply sucks and that's the truth.",0
"A Transformational Approach to Money: I really enjoyed the book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"". It was a new way of looking at money for me. This book narrated by Robert Kiyosaki tells the story of Robert's real father and his best friends dad. His real dad, ""poor dad"", worked for his money, while his ""rich dad"" had his money work for him.Kiyosaki explains even a person with a lot of money in the bank can be poor, though they have financial wealth in the bank, they are still poor mentally as now they are afraid they are going to lose all their money.I loved that Kiyosaki says ""It's not what you make, it's what you keep"" If you make $100K and spend $125k you are poor. ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" teaches you to act like, be like and think like a Rich person instead of a poor person.Another transformational book I really enjoyed was Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by Ariel & Shya Kane. It is a book of short stories that are inspirational.",1
received wrong book: I was going to use the book last week but then I realized that I had gotten a totally different book than the one I ordered. I didn't realize it when I received it in the mail I guess.,0
Good way to learn notes around the guitar: I raced through the first few chapters and really enjoyed learning the notes around the keyboard. As you progress i think the chapters get more difficult to understand. I have been playing guitar about 8 months and have gotten my moneysworth so far. As i progress i hope to understand the later chapters. I recommend this book highly.,1
"Great recipes!: I bought the book thinking it was just a little ""Andy Griffith"" nostalgia, but was pleasantly surprised when the recipes were actually great! As a mother of 6, my family welcomed some new ideas for dinner (I welcomed that they were simple to make)! Also get ""Aunt Bea's Delightful Desserts.""",1
"Rated ""0"": If the ratings would go down to zero that is what this CD should have gotten. The people that liked this CD must have a build up of ear wax in their ears . This is without a doubt the worst colection of songs I have ever heard on one CD.",0
"Where fore art thou shiv?: I went to the university library to take out a copy of ""The Secret"" in hopes of finding the infamous shiv. Alas, to my dismay I fear I had gotten there too late, for the cavity was present, but the shiv was missing. I have in my head, after looking around the campus a possible list of suspects...Looking for shank marks now. I have seen three so far; thankfully all three victims are still alive......Shiv still missing.",0
"The veridict is not in yet...: I was very excited when I first received the item to go along with the Interfit Studio Lights I ordered. The unit itself is rather light and flimsy, but I figured it really just needs to fire off the monolight flashes and does not need to be a durable piece of photographic equipment. Batteries installed easily, took my first dozen or so photos and the unit worked perfectly. Soon it would work only every other time even when my camera position had not changed. Then the unit would have to be switched off an back on in order to work. I thought the batteries might be going dead and thought this thing was a battery ""drainer"". Put brand new Energizer batteries in. It worked for about a dozen wore shots then stopped working completely! I intitiated a return with Amazon in hopes that this was a defective unit. When I get my new unit delivered I will update this review to let you know if this was a defective unit or if the unit just plain does not work well.",0
"Nice, but it eats batteries: I love having the information of time and in/out temp right in plain view, and this piece displays well. However, I have replaced the batteries (new energizer batteries) twice in 1 week. Due to this shortcoming, I would not recommend this product.",0
"Too Many Characters: Have read several books by this author, however this one has been my least favorite. I have not read the sequel and probably will not.",0
"Well worth the time - check it out: This book is different from other books by this author butexcellent. As usual it is full of interest and character.The difference is there are historical flashbacks and thatcan make it more difficult to read flipping between nowand ""then"". However, I'd suggest the new reader startwith her earlier books first before reading this book.Then you will appreciate this book more.",1
Horrible!: Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It claims to be a thriller but I had to force myself to watch until the end waiting for anything substantive or exciting to happen...an hour and a half of my life I can't get back. I would try to sell the movie but I would feel guilty taking even ... from someone and perpetuating this atrocity.,0
"Don't buy this book.: The author, Matt Buschbacher, is known to have recently engaged in neo-Nazi activities.If you're interested in the subject, buy another book by a different author. Don't put money in this guy's pocket, to spend on his hate stuff.",0
"Too Old, Too Bad: When this game first came out it was good for that time and it had reasonobly good graphics for that time. Within the next 2 months or so new games and systems started to come out and those games and systems became a lot better and were more fun. Because people thought this game was good at that time so many people bought it, and now poeple are all stuck with it and are trying to sell it for very cheap. This is why there are so many used ones. Let me give you a piece of advice, don't buy this if you still have a playstation and like it, get a game that is closer to this year. You will like it a lot more",0
"Great tub! Baby loves it: Our baby loves the tub! It's comfy, she can sit up an play and it fits nicely in our tub. I'm not sure why they added the ridiculous ducky sound piece in the duck's beak, but love it aside from that dumb addition.",1
Great backpack: I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is going back to school. He loved it and said it has a lot of compartments which he really likes. It is well made and the fact that it can roll and has a telescoping handle means he is gonna use it for a carry on when he flies too.,1
"Casino Un-Royale: Spend your money on popcorn, not this film. The story is poor at best, acting is so-so, and the theme is awful. Sellers and Niven are much better actors than portrayed here. This is a horrible movie. Nothing to do with a ""007 James Bond"" type film at all. Very disappointing.",0
"SEEN IT ALREADY...: i just happened to be flipping through channels and stopped on BET and noticed MARQUES HOUSTON and OMARION in a movie together, ONCE AGAIN. i didn't realized that i was watching THE SEQUEL to SOMEBODY HELP ME, PART 1. i could have sworn the first was titled, CABIN IN THE WOODS, but anyways. i watched a good 45 min of this movie, and the ACTING was more frightening than the storyline. it was like a VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY BAD version of HOSTEL. i would definitely say that the first is better. this was so low budget.",0
"Happy Birthday!: I received this doll as my B-day gift and let me tell you she's beautiful. She is in a collectors box with a plastic cover that can be removed if you want to pose her head. You can put the cover back on and your doll is still Mint in Box. This doll looks a little ethnic, maybe a latina. Regardless she's beautiful and she's in the Silver Label so she'll be worth a good penny years from now.",1
"Christian Holy War?: I bought this in a local Barnes and Noble bookstore and was astonished by it. I guess the astonishment is part shock and part amazement. I was impressed by the author's bravery in tackling the concept of Christian Holy War. I know it's a historic concept in the experience of Christians, but not many talk about it in today's political correct culture. And I was shocked by the way he bravely described real life scenarios and what Christians are supposed to do. I found it slight uncomfortable at first that he thought police and army should be released from their allegiance to local governments if they oppose Christ and the Body of Christ. But upon thinking about the issues a further and reading the Bible with the ideas of the book in mind, I came to realize, he is espousing the precise point that Jesus had when He preached about the Kingdom of Christ. I would recommend this book to all who think seriously about Christian commitments in today's confused world.",1
"What Fun!!!: Never being an ace at geometry, it is such a pleasure when someone else figures it out and put it such simple terms. I received the book 3 days ago, after being captivated by the Simply Quilts episode, and have made 3 of the Swirligig Wreaths, which makes a beautiful table centers for everyday or elegant use. When I opened my stash cabinet the ideas just jump out. Now I am planning a full sized quilt!! You will love this book for its simple instructions and the complicated look. Have Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Very good UK entry: While we in the US load up on VH1 celebreality, the Brits make a great zombie mini series. Once again, corporate America complains about the internet, yet they don't make it available in the US. If you liked Dawn Of The Dead 2004/28 days etc, you should ""seek"" this one out. Very enjoyable story of an outbreak on the set of Big Brother.",1
"Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!: I ordered a pair of Phillips surroud sound headphones at the Target website. The first thing that dissapointed me was the shipping price. Seven dollars for a light package package that would fit in my mail box. Once I opened them I was very dissapointed. The ear buds that came with my mp3 (which probbably costed five dollars) had deeper richer sound. They are not even comftorable. It's like when the doctor looks in your ears. They might have ""surround sound"" but they are not special, not worth the price.",0
"Not in the same class with others of the ilk: I've read the first three books in this series, and I can't say I particularly cared for this one. The werewolves are pretty silly, and not nearly as fleshed out as other authors' portrayal of the same. Plus, I just don't really care for Vicki. She is nowhere near in the same class as Anita Blake as far as being a well-rounded character. You'd think someone would have a little bit of soul-searching if they are involved sexually/romatically with two men simultaneously. It is possible to be a ""tough girl"" and still have emotions.",0

"This is a horrible clock!: I had this clock for only 2 months but now my clock has problems creating. On this clock if you switch to wake time, It won't show the wake time! It will just show the normal time! I use this clock for school but the clock does notFunction properly! Do not buy! Its a waste of money! (I Mean it)",0
"Say you didn't right this, Mr. Uris.: ...I checked this audiotape out at the library. But I do a lot of purchasing here and I also rely heavily on Amazon.com customer reviews in making my book purchasing choices. Unfortunately, somehow I didn't consult them when selecting Ruins. Man I sure should have. After listening to Ruins, I honestly felt betrayed. I haven't anything new to add that hasn't already been covered in the other reviews. I would like to offer a challenge though. I challenge anyone to find a book from an author as great as Leon Uris that is as bad as this one. I grew up on Leon Uris. He is the reason I became a historical fiction devotee. For that I will forgive him (maybe not his editor), and I can only hope we will see a return to the writing standard of his previous works.",0
Great: Worth a listen no matter how old you are. Can learn a lot about arrangement from this producer. One for the ages.,1
Workout DVD Review: I have purchased items on-line only once. This particular video I bought is broken. One of the 4 cd's doesn't even work. I spent $60 for videos that look like they have been copied and resealed. What's up with that? Can I return these?,0
So Disappointed: I got so excited when I saw this and ordered - not understanding that it is dubbed in english - so now I am stuck with it,0
"If you like Jazz....: I bought this CD for Israel Kamakawe-ole's rendition of Somewhere over the Rainbow/What a wonderful world, and I ended up falling in love with the musical stylings of Bill Frisell. This CD is very Jazz heavy, so be forewarned.",1
"Not as good as Abbot's first novel: I was really really looking forward to reading this second novel of Cameron Abbott's and was really disappointed. (Ms. Abbott's first novel was 'To the Edge.') The storyline and characters are almost identical as the ones in her first novel (To the Edge). However, in this second book, the characters were much less likable and romantic/sexual. I turned this book into my local gay bookstore for a store credit as soon as I could.I would NOT recommend this book and I hope Ms. Abbott's next book has more likable characters and does not get into the nitty gritty of 'the law' and concentrates more on developing the romantic relationship between her characters. I usually have this same gripe (the lack of developed characters) when i read mysery novels, which is why I hardly read them anymore.",0
Wonderful book for healing: It is so important to have healing in your past so you can have a happy future not only for yourself but your children also deserve to have a healthy happy parent that can support and help them on this journey called life.,1
"BIG ARMBAND: I bought this for my 16-yr-old son. He is a long distance runner, and well the armband is to big for him as well as to big for me and I am not super thin. So, If you are not a grown man, with a well developed upper arm.... We are going to try and sew it to fit his arm.",0
"It works for me!: I had years of back pains and went through all kinds of therapy you can think of. I won't list them here because I don't want to discourage you from trying any of that. I was practically giving up and ready for surgery until I came across this book in my local library one day. As soon as I read it, the whole thing became crystal clear to me - that the root cause was not my back, but the things that was happening to my life during that time. I'm an engineer by training and by profession, and I would be the last person to embrace the new age things, but this book showed me the clear path on how to rebuild my life and my health. If you gave up all hopes like I did, give this book a chance. It worked for me!",1
"Week on facts and substantiating inuendo: I failed to see anything alarming about Gore from this book. The inuendos are extremely week and unsubstantiated. For example, the author galvanizes Gore for being a life long polititian having early ambitions to be president. So what?! What's funny is he's actually not that good a polititian having focussed too heavily on policy and not enough on campaigning in most of his bouts. A lot of this book is also unsubstantiated suggestion with no real basis behind it.So read the book if you like, but you probably wont be that concerned. If you want dirt that really matters, read ""Shrub, The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush"". But, Al's dirt just isn't that alarming.",0
"not practice oriented: Good collection of images from various methods with nicely identified structures. But it is not daily practice-oriented. There's not a word about important topics such as neck spaces, peritoneal spaces and ligaments, mediastinal lymphnode stations, among others. I found Butler's Applied Radiological Anatomy much more useful.",0
"Works Great with 25lb Dog: Installs in minutes. Nothing to screw on the wall. It's just the right height for our 25lbs dog....he can't get over it, but we can walk over it. Really beats having to open and close a doggy door/gate every time.Great product for the price. Highly recommended.",1
Horrible: Not for beginners or those with back problems. Many streches could be done much safer and acheive the same results.Great for new-age pretzels.,0
"Best writer of the 20th Century: Sowell's perspective on liberal, enlightenment philosophies is the most clearly defined and explained work one could read. His book The Vision of the Anointed is my vote for best book of the 20th Century! He understands liberal ""thinking"" and demagog worship; he can expound upon their approaches and make the reader clearly see what is confusing to the intellectual mind: that is, What are they thinking? How did they get to that conlcusion? If you truly want to understand where our philosophies have become so distorted and entangled with the absurd, read this or any of Sowell's works.P.S. I am aware that book titles should be underlined, but the Amazon site will not allow me to pull up that tool bar when using their review site.",1
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Ego Has Left the Building: What you will read in this work in the advice of a psychiatrist who actually believes that enlightenment is achievable and who wants to help you get there if it is your goal.This is the third book in the series that began with ""Power vs. Force"" and ""The Eye of the I"". It addresses what the ego is all about in more detail, even covering meta-egoistic notions such as national identity and patriotism in a spiritual context. Largely in a Q&A; format, it seems less structured that the earlier books, but it is nevertheless replete with profound insights not easily obtained elsewhere.In the end, it becomes clear that in order to achieve higher levels of consciousness, you have to let your ego go. The book is well worth a read to find out how this might be possible.",1
"Its a Song, not a Jingle!: All of the negative reviews for this book boggle me - or rather the dominate reason behind the negativity - that the reviewers favorite character makes too brief an appearance or none at all. This would make sense to me if The Song of Fire and Ice was about a certain set of characters, but as was made abundantly clear in A Game of Thrones, the Song is the main character, not the people who compose it. I am surprised that anyone can finish book one, let along three books, without that becoming painfully clear.This is a wonderfully written book. Like many I wanted to see more of Arya, Tyrion and Hodor, but any disappointment I feel stems from my desire for instant gratification. This series is brandy, not tequilla. Savor it.",1
"Bloodless: The sensational Romanian Gypsy group Taraf de Haidouks has justifiably become one of the hottest attractions on the world music circuit, so somebody must have had the idea of capitalizing on their celebrity by getting them to do ""re-gypsified"" versions of classical compositions derived from Rom sources.The idea definitely does not work. Here we have new arrangements of works by Bartok, Khachatourian and others that just squeeze the vitality out of them. I hope never again to hear so pathetically bloodless a version of Falla's Ritual Fire Dance. A saving grace is that about a third of the disc is the group doing its own thing. But most of these selections can be found on other albums, so if you're a Taraf de Haidouks fan, forget this.",0
"Don't Buy: Bought two of these in different sizes. They are a waste of time and springs are so stiff that it is not easy to jump in them. I didn't think they would get the height that's shown in the photos, but the photos make it appear easy to jump in and they are not and they can hardly jump off the ground. My kids are athletic too and they don't like them. Returning them both. Also, kids can sprain an ankle with these.",0
"A must-have baby toy: This toy has great play and learning value. I have watched my sons progress from struggling to place the rings on the pole, to learning how to sort them by size and place them in the correct order. It has good bright colours, and I appreciated the fact that they were in correct rainbow order! This toy is very durable and has survived two babies' teething periods. I can see its play value lasting as my sons get older too, as we have had five and six year old visitors use it as a quoits game.",1
"Failed to perform: We bought this product new. On its initial use, this product ran well, but failed to remove pet hair, meaning that it does not perform the task it was intended to do. We have a shih-tzu, and have used various clippers on her over the years. This product did not clip the hair at all, and we found that even after removing the length guard and holding the hair up between our fingers, the clippers made no effort to cut. This product fails in every important respect. We would have taken it back to the store, but became so frustrated with it that I destroyed it. I'm sending the broken pieces to Wahl with a very nasty letter. No more Wahl products for us.",0
not bad....: easy to get fighting right away. havent done much yet just building my guy up as fast as i can.,1
"Stating the obvious: This book focuses only on identifying the visual, auditory and kinaethetic (VAK) representational systems and applying them to communication, learning and training. The author admits in the Preface, ""Many trainers may read this book and believe that, in my discussions of the various training aids, I am stating the obvious. To a certain extent, that is true."" (p.xii) I'm afraid this is too true. Sally's effort to give more detailed discussions only insults the intelligence of trainers. Do not be misled by the title of the book, thinking that you'll get much help ""through NLP"". The scope is very limited and the content much too basic.",0

"useful in understdg ppl's behaviour: Written by an English anthropologist about her own nation's behaviour. There're some interesting explanation on why British ppl are so uneasy socializing, talking about money and may sometimes talking in the opp way (hypocrisy). While many of the explanations suggested by the author are convincing, I found those behaviour not unique to the British, they can be observed in our Chi society as well! So it's useful in understdg ppl's behaviour.",1
"Season 1 part 2 is GREAT: It's true, the second half IS better than the first. I definately recommended this DVD set. I really enjoyed this series and it was great to see the character's development. Very emotional and deep for a kids show! It is different from G1, but then again, has some similarities, and can be enjoyed by G1 and non-transformer fans alike.",1

Clapton / Townshend / Winwood / Wood: I bought the original release on vinyl that included only six songs. The newly remastered release includes the entire concert and an excellent version of LAYLA.

"lacking in quality: many students in my class newly perchased this book less than 5 months ago, and within 2 months of barly any use, many students were complaining that the book's bindings were falling apart! almost all of the class's books were falling apart. also, many of the chapters have hundreds of vocab words, but many of the vocab words are repeated and repeated! it is nice that the book gives both simplified and traditional characters, but the grammar examples and the homework exercises are only done in simplified...which is a real pain if you only know traditional.",0
"Don't waste your time.: It was a pointless movie, about three kids with no guts that were buggin about every little sound that is normal to hear in the woods. It will make you motion sick. It was not scarey, I would go out in the woods right after watching it and wouldn't be scared. It didn't have enough blood and guts you know the gorry stuff like if Heather or Josh got hacked up. I will never watch this movie again not on HBO, Cinimax, or FOX. I would advise anyone not to see it, it's a waste of time and money.",0

"how did this win the Hugo and Nebula?: I am plowing my way through all the Hugo award winners right now and after the sublime lterary quality of works such as Ursula K LeGuin's ""The Dispossessed"" and Miller's ""Canticle for Lebowitz"" I am appalled at this choice. The character's are flimsy and the plot, oh dear. Time travel always has it's problems but the solution to avoiding paradoxes here is something a ten year old could have dreamed up. A major portion of the book is spent trying to locate a time traveller in the past, and all the slapstick events that prevent them from doing so. The main character who is claimed as a brilliant student does the most inept job as an historian. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",0
"Sending them back...: I should have heeded the reviews that said that these jeans do not fit properly. I actually tried on a pair in a local brick and mortar store and they fit perfectly, (40/30's) so I thought I'd try to save $20 by buying them online. Bad idea. The jeans ordererd through Amazon were a completely different fit. The ones in the store were made in Nicaragua and the Amazon jeans were made in Egypt. I have no idea if that has anything to do with the fit problem or not, but it's a shame to see Levi's destroying what USED to be a great AMERICAN product.",0
"Inferior quality..: The product is not 18/10 - it is actually 18/0 on the exterior with only a stainless 202 grade cooking surface. The 202 is about the cheapest quality stainless in use and is not generally accepted as cookware grade - It certainly is not professional grade. The 202 is prone to stains, rusting and easily scratches. Unlike true 18/10 these scratches will not self repair/seal.",0
"Quietest fan I've ever had: I bought this fan after reading many of the reviews here. I have sensitive hearing and this fan is truly quiet on speed 1. Speed 2 isn't bad and speed 3 is louder but I rarely have to use anything but speed 1. I use my fan in my bedroom for direct cooling. I experienced the annoying ticking of the timer when I first got it and tried it out, but as long as you don't turn that knob, the fan doesn't tick. Some reviewers complained that the fan doesn't really oscillate. The grill rotates counterclockwise and moves the air only a little, not nearly as much as a fan that moves from side to side. I get dizzy if I watch it. $20 is a great price for this awesome little fan. I highly recommend it. I'll be buying another one.",1
pop uo turtle: my daughter really enjoyed this in that pre-crawling stage when she would play on a blanket... she really liked action and consequence so this worked well!,1
"Boring... z z Z Z...: I don't really want to compare this to any other game, because I want this rating to be unbiased. If you want a bike sim, Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX may be for you... (I recommend renting it first.) The game is based on the Bus Tour theme, where you get a chance to ride in different cities around the U.S. I found it monotonous and boring after a couple of days playing it. Some stage goals are tedious, frustrating, but challenging. Your prize for goal completion is the ability to unlock other cities. And that's pretty much what the game can offer. Sound exciting??? If you ever do buy or rent this game, notice how bored the BMX riders look when they're in the garage. This might be a hint to what that game will be like.",0
"Pretty Good Calculator: I needed a good graphing calculator quick, and this one really does the job. It's just as good as the later models, don't waste your money on the more expensive ones. The batteries do go pretty quick though. I have to constantly adjust the contrast due to low battery power.",1

"Treo 650 A Disappointment for Palm: I am a committed Palm user, heavy traveller, and technically savvy. I am sorry to say that after trying for 3 months, I am abandoning the treo 650 as a disaster. The system software is continually crashing (despite updates), the phone is erratic, and syncing and file management has been a nightmare. I have put in many hours to try and fix it, and had one unit returned because it was defective. But today I've decided to stop bothering, abandon the unit I paid $500 for, and go back to my normal cell phone. Badly done Palm.",0
"Poor Sound System - Low Humming and Static Noise: We have the TV for 6 months now.The persistent humming sound spoils our TV watching experience. We tried DVD and other inputs such as video games and Karaoke. The humming noise is presistent. The static noise come with HDTV programs. DVD seems to be fine.Purchase extented warrenty if you must have this TV. By default, Magnavox only covers labor for the first 6 months, although parts are one-year under warranty.We've had many TVs over the years. The Magnavox 37"" LCD has poorest quality. We would not recommend it.",0
"Very fun game, a bit too short though.: Despite the fact that I only ever finished 2 levels with a gold star (silver for the rest) this was quite an easy game. I took it on holiday with the intention of it being decent fodder for downtime but I finished it all in 6 days.Asides from that it's very cute and colorful (as with most Mario games) and has some great gameplay and tunes. It's a lot like the Lemmings games crossed with a little bit of snakes and ladders. The puzzles are clever and fun to solve and it's never boring. I did find the lack of response (only sometimes) from the stylus pen to be a bit annoying, but it wasn't that big of a deal.Perfect for kids, a decent distraction for adults.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal B-",1

What is this?: This sounds like a bunch of girls singing. I have no idea why people think they are so great. They were the worst band of the 80s. Get it through your heads they had less musical talent than New kids on the block. At leat NKOTB sounded like guys. My advice dont buy it. Or buy it for a door stop!,0

"A Real Hoot!: After watching several movies that really stunk, this was a refreshing change. Filled with a bleak atmosphere, this dark story kept me interested from the first scene. I loved the WW1 inspired machinery that is peppered throughout the story. The hero, or as I call him, ""Sarge"" was a great caricature of the tough army NCO that keeps on going. The special effects are great, though the gore was a bit overdone.As typical for this type of movie, there aren't many survivors, so it's just a matter of guessing which sidekick gets knocked off first.This is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, but it kept me awake and entertained from start to finish. Highly recommended.",1
"Readable, indepth look at important photography concepts: I am just getting into photography and would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting more serious about photography, or has been at it for a while and wants a refresher. Figures and photo examples help to make the author's points very clear. Exercises for practicing concepts outlined in book were also very useful.",1
"I'm with the band: If you are reading this book to get info on the sex lives of various rock icons, save your money. There are no details at all about sex with any of them, just names and how nice everyone is. Too sweet and neat to be factual. You would think they were all wonderful people who were good to everyone and knocked themselves out to be great to Pamela. There was little mention of substance abuse or any other issue that would reflect badly on the icons. If you want someone gushing over every icon she ever met, then this is the one for you.",0
"No very stable: Purchased this stroller for a 27 lb dog. It is not very stable. If she moves to one side or the other it is hard to keep the stroller straight. You must keep both hands on the stroller to keep it going straight. It moves dramatically when the road dips and changes. It would be much better with regards to the steering and stablility if it had four wheels. Not sure a 60 lb dog would fit. Also, small rocks in road make indents into the plastic tires.",0
"I don't get it: I just got this program today, and have only had a few hours to figure it out, but I just don't get it. I consider myself pretty computer savy, and was hoping for something sort of similar to imovie. First off, this thing didn't come with an instruction book. (was it supposed to?) Second, the help part wasn't helpful at all. I was able to create a title, but wasn't able to see what it looks like with the video. When I finally saved a video, all that played when I clicked on it was the sound. I will continue to look on-line for some info on how to work this thing, but so far I am extremely unhappy. The only good thing about it was that it was easy to install, and as far as I can tell, my computer isn't full of crazy worms and viruses caused by the program.",0
"Just what my wife wanted!: I bought this product for my wife and when she is satisfied, then it simply means that I picked the good product, and good means a lot of things here, performance, size, weight and price. Good job Conair!",1
"Disappointed at automatic default: I bought this to replace a model from 4 years ago. Sadly, this was a step backward from the earlier version. The annoyance comes from the fact that this model (140) does not default to whatever settings you had entered prior to shutdown. Instead, it always defaults to the factory settings on power-up (highway mode), making you re-enter the mode you want. So, if you regularly drive in the city and wish to have one of the 3 city modes, you must re-enter this every time you turn on the ignition.This is a dumb, stupid design choice on Whistler's part. It would have cost them nothing to lock the mode each time at power-off.",0

"So long and boring: This book was recommended to me by a good, trusted friend. It is the worst book I have read in ages. It was very long without enough story to fill its abundant pages. I finished it--though, I'll admit to having skimmed the last hundred pages. I was so relieved when it was over--not the right feeling to have when you've just read a book.",0
"Wha? Did I miss something?: I read all of the reviews here and oddly enough none of them mentioned Ethan Johns. That's funny because didn't he write all of these songs? Southern fried white strokes? More like Southern fried O-Town. Sadly enough, the problem with the album is not only the sordid backstory, but the music is bad, too. That is unfortunate in my book because I am a big fan of Ethan Johns. I think Ryan Adam's HEARTBREAKER might have been one of the best albums in the past 10 years. But this doesn't fare well against his previous work. It's only a matter of time before the Kings of Leon start calling him ""Colonel."" So if you want the Tennessee version of the Monkees, stay here. But if you want rock you'll have to leave this town, Nointegrityville, and head about a million miles north to My Morning Jacket.It's just a matter of time before this album starts to fill up the used bins at your local music store. As a matter of fact there are 30 used copies available on Amazon as I type this.",0

"Worst Shadowrun novel: It seems to be a trend in Shadowrun books to make the main character nigh invincible and Wolf and Raven is one of the worst at this. This book does not focus on a single plot, but a collection of idiotic stories.

Or don't, and save yourself 6 bucks.",0
Ruined our meal. Anyone actually eat this stuff?: We purhcased a can of this sauce from Walmart to make enchiladas with. No one would eat their meal because this sauce tasted so bad.

"Good for athletics: I got these when I started running and the earbuds that came with my MP3 player were driving me insane. I wanted something that would actually stay in my ears. These do the trick! I had a hard time at first figuring out how to situate them in my ear so they didn't get sweaty and fall out, but once you do that, no problems. They stay put and drown out other gym noise while I'm on the treadmill. I'd definitely recommend them if you want some good, basic earbuds that stay put while working out.",1
Never Again: We have now had two collars just like this. This first one broke in about a month so the store replaced it. Now the second one has stopped working just a few months later. I think we stopped using it for a while and it still did not last more than a couple weeks. The batteries run down in just a few days. Those type of batteries are not very cheap. I would never buy another collar from this company again.,0
"Nothing special: Bought this for my college math class. It works, but is nothing special. Also the screen is kind of hard to read.",1
fit: The Putco Element chrome window visor does NOT fit a 2012 toyota camry. They are 2-3 inches short. A big waste of time and money.,0
"What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!: I had very high hopes for this unit. Unfortunately, it has a MAJOR technical problem right now that technical support has submitted to their testing center. Note: I HAVE applied all *three* of the latest firmware/software updates.Basically, after choosing to listen to a specific Genre on the remote, the unit plays ALL songs from your music library, regardless of Genre.If you can live with that, for $250 big ones, it's a nice product. For me, it's worthless.",0
"A dull, boring experience: I'm a big fan of Babylon 5, even took the time to put together my own model Starfurry. Got the pencil sharpeners for my office, taped the episodes, watched the repeats, etc. And so, finding a novel by JMS's own wife filling in the gaps of Sinclair's life seemed great... And then I read it. Terrible. Within a few pages I realized this ranks right up there with the long list of horribly-written Star Trek books. And my major complaint is with the writing. The style is very tedious. Sorry, Babylon fans, skip this book! My other complaint is the sheer lack of action. Chapter after chapter goes by while NOTHING happens. Sinclair looks at the statue of Valen. Sinclair sits around. Sinclair seems to be in charge of high-tech military training yet he doesn't interact with the students. Right up to the ending, which wasn't a surprise, seemed a long drawn-out, boring experience. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
"30% Sales Pitch: The techniques used in teaching the steps are OK, but he never goes beyond the really basic step. At least 30% of the video is a sales pitch for more Cal Pozo dance videos. I was disappinted",0
"Excellent value: This trimmer works better than most in all areas (esp. battery charge life!!!)the only downside i've experienced is that it tends to get clogged frequently and cutting efficency deminishes. so clean it as you use it, and all is well!Great product!",1
"Love this book!: This book is much cheaper than actually taking a class at Gymboree! It breaks the book up by 0+ months, 3+ months, 6+ months, and 9+ months. Some of the games are things you probably do already but there are some really good ideas. My son (4 months) loves it when we sing the songs and I bounce him on my knee or swing him back and forth. He loves it when I stretch him in the morning and when I roll him over with a blanket. I would never have done these things with him if it were not for this book!",1
"I can't believe someone would give 5 starts: I got this keyboard based on the good reviews it got. Let me tell you this is exceptional piece of ...... . The only good thing about this keyboard is that its foldable and easy to carry with you. The only way you can type on this keyboard, is if you looking down on the keys and firmly press on each key. If you like me, who types without looking on the keyboard, this keyboard will drive you nuts as you realize that you mistype because you didn't press the key hard enough. Also instead of one Shift / Enter keys, there are two small keys next to each other. I never saw that kind of setup, and I hate it.If you looking for lighted keyboard get Saitek keyboard. Saitek is $10 dollars more but 100 times better.",0
"Good but very, very hard: I'm not use to using a step, but if you are then this is a good hard class for you! Enjoy I'm going to keep at it until I can do without stopping to catch my breath and balance!",1
"Excellent Seller/Merchandisw: I want to commend this seller for their accurate detail of product, excellent price, quick shipping, and a product that exceeded my expectations. It is a replacement for a monitor I already have that is losing pixels all around. This new unit actually works better than my old one ever did! The unit came in its original box, with original power, sound and digital cords along with the driver CD and full instrucion manual. Actually just like new. Thanks, Great job!",1
Samsung YA-CD100 Helix Home Docking Kit: My only drawback with this is that it should have been a part of the package. It is a bit pricey,1
poor: I wanted the whole movie they cut every thing out of this one some of the best parts were cut out .I rather have the full version.,0
"comforting and jammy: this album is really really good. just pure goodness. it original, but its still rock. its like a jammy coldplay meets sleater kinney meets The Like with a dash of pink floyd. its an album that i can listen to walking down the street and wondering about stuff. or an album to sit and listen to while ur daydreaming while looking at the sun. and a few songs you can maybe bust out on the dancefloor, but not at all techno. techno is garbage. this band is a great band. this is the first album that i have of theirs and i'm going to get their others. i just don't believe that they could create anything i don't like. buy this cd now!",1
"Stunning film!: This movie is absolutely breathtaking! I grew up in Alaska, surrounded by its magnificent scenery and wildlife, but the footage that Adam has captured is absolutely outstanding and inspiring. I highly recommend this movie, regardless of whether you live, have visited, or have never experienced the beauty that Alaska has to offer. I was absolutely amazed at the footage, soothing music, and informative and inspiring narration. I guarantee once you buy this movie you'll be planning your next trip to experience the wonders of Alaska for your self!",1
"unusable: if you lie sideways, the bulky construction of it disturbs you. also because of it touching the pillow, gaps opens and light leaks inside. if you lie on your back, now the rough velcro fastened belt is disturbing back of your head. don't even think about sleeping on your chest",0
"Not a durable toy!!!: Our dog has the large ball and a plush toy that makes the same sound. We all laugh at the sounds these toys make and our dog has a ball playing with them. However, within 5 minutes of receiving this bone, he had chewed into one of the ends. I think, if you are going to buy this toy, you had better supervise your pet closely!!!! We threw the toy out that day so it was a big waste of money. Our dog still loves and plays with the ball and plush toy and doesn't try to destroy either one of them.",0
Amazing book.: This book is so suspenseful that I read till midnight. Awesome book must read. You have got to read it note Victor dies.,1
"Surprisingly exciting: When I picked up this book, I knew what it was about before looking it up but I had no idea it would be as exciting as it was. The entire time you're wondering whether or not the people of Ember will escape from their quickly dying city or if they'll all get caught in an eternal black out before our two protagonists figure out a way to get them out of there.What I found to be particularly interesting to read was all the moments where so many characters (especially the main two) kept being astonished by things we all naturally take for granted. Pineapple, for example, and light that doesn't come from a street lamp. I think this book re-energized my appreciation for the things we often take for granted.I look forward to reading the sequel, I'll be getting it as soon as I get a chance, and I'll be recommending it to people no matter what age they are.",1
"Good value for the money: Excellent product - been using for several years on advice of my orthopedic doctor/surgeon - as long as I use this product doctors tell me I will not have to undergo the surgery. Usually purchase from Walgr--n's, but it was cheaper in Amazon this week.",1
"Definitive Debut...: I only give out 5 stars to those that are deserving...and let me tell you this guy is deserving! Every song, every beat has a nice groove, hook or rhythm. It flows like the Nile...effortlessly! Glad to see this brother step from behind the shadows of others and put his own project out there. I really enjoy the smoothy, jazzy, delightful air of this CD.Very Well done...very well",1
"Not a great one: If you are a fan of the Black Stallion series, you may notice that this book is different. In all of the others, Alec and The Black have a unique bond that no one understands. In my opinion, it should be kept that way. Here, the girl can ride The Black, and Alec is obsessed with her. I recommend readers to read all of the series except this one.",0
"A collection piece and nice sequel: I bought this book because I owned ""Tricks for the Game Programming Gurus"" (the first one), which I like very much. I found this second one to be a must-have if you like the first one, but not as great. Still, there are many ""tricks"" that would be important for the game programmer in the 90's. Today, it's more for a curious reader, as it won't help with a new project. The book is mostly focused on DOS, but even DOS today won't work the same way, as hardware is entirely different.",1
"Good choice.: WE were looking for a toaster with one long wide slot, and this was about the only one that filled the bill. We are getting used to the settings and so far, it is definitely living up to expectations. We are not interested in a toaster oven (not enough counter space) and this is a good useful toaster for our purposes.",1
"It's ok, but too primitive: First of all - it doesn't look like on the picture - just simple piece of not-anodized aluminium. It doesn't have contact. It doesn't have spring, flash shoe is fixed by small bolt on the side. The 1/4"" screw hole goes through, so be careful - you can damage your flash shoe if tight screw too much!. It works, just be careful. I think $7 is too much for such primitive construction.",0
"Great Bargain, Terrific Performance!: This is a great waffler for the money! A little cooking spray ensures no-stick performance, but even without it, sticking isn't a problem. It wipes clean with a damp paper towel! I love the timer -- it lets you know when your waffle is done (2-4 minutes). The waffles are wonderful, and the waffler stores standing upright, taking up very little space. I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend the product.",1
"Dude,: I would like to tell the guy who said that I was an idiot that he doesn't know what he is talking about. Kurt has won a real life gold medal. Shawn has been doing fake wrestling his whole life. If you tried to put Shawn in a Olympic stile match he would suck. Kurt is the better wrestler. Everybody in the WWE fakes it but HBK really just can't do it. Kurt will win with the Ankle Lock and watch little HBK tap out in the middle of the ring.",0
High price for a cheap looking watch: I have ordered this watch for my friend and when he received it he was disappointed for the following reasons:1. Too small for men. Good for children only.2. The weight was very light as if it is nothing.3. Generally looks very cheep.4. The price is very high for this watch.5. The lock is also bad.The design is the only thing I liked.,0
"This movie stinks: Horrible movie, not even close to as good as the 1st one was. If you want to see a good trilogy, then go see the Lord Of The Rings.",0
"outstanding: Soulful, artful, close, Chris is one of those people who whether you see them in person or just hear them recorded, you feel like you know them; an outstanding record. My long time complaint of Chris, and he knows this, is that there isn't a second album.",1
"Extremely poor picture quality--out of focus: Extremely poor picture quality--out of focus-.plane pure garbage... I did not have a chance to write a full review- but I did buy another DVD, and it was excellent",0
"Cool Sound!: These are great headphones! I also have the older model that hurt the ears, but these are great. The bass is great. The well-hidden microphone is clear and distinct. Only complaint I have is the battery, short life, and the headphones start gradually loosing volume after an hour or so of use.Overall suberb sound and great looks! Buy them!",1
TeleVue: I've absolutely love this eyepiece. Sharp with excellent contrast. I've had this eyepiece for about a year and everyone that has looked through it have commented on how great the views. Pricey.... yes but worth it.,1
"Yeech: I have discoverd that I do not like Mr. Whites writing style so this is a very biased review. I am sure many people love this series, I tried and it is not me. Read Lee Childs series about Jack Reacher, much better.",0
"bloated game with little fun: it would be one thing if the long wait for this game was because of revolutinary gameplay but everything about this is so average, from the graphics to the management. I literally fell asleep at the computer.I also would not recomend this game for anyone that is a computer hobbyist, with the drm it makes it impossibl to do fresh installs.btw, those that say you don't actually own games according to the license, well that is bs, with games on consoles you can buy, sell , and trade the games you buy on ebay or ebworld, not this one. infuriating.",0
"Melee Rocks!!!: I think Super Smash Bros Melee is the best game for the Gamecube so far. The detail and graphics are awesome, and there are a lot of levels to choose from. Also, there is a wide character selection (who wouldn't want to be Bowser and Kick Pikachu's butt all over the place?) There are also a lot of hidden characters to be unlocked, and most of them are extremely cool. However, I must warn you that the game can sometimes be frustrating on event modes, adventure modes and home run modes. In addition, sometimes unlocking characters can be very difficult. Even so, this game RULES!!! If you have a Gamecube, or are considering one, you will want to check this game out. IT TOTALLY REEKS OF AWESOMENESS!!!",1
"This book is BLODDY AWESOME!: Man, I've been an OZZY fan since TRIBUTE but I had no idea how much Sabbath affected metal music until I read this book! I took the author's advice and bought ALL of the Sabbath albums. Now I can't get them out of my head! BLACK SABBATH AND OZZY RULES!!Another cool thing is that the guy who wrote the liner notes for the KISS remasters wrote this book. He also wrote the copy on OZZY's bubble-gum cards that I bought at Spencers. DO me a favor, Mr. Conte--write about JUDAS PRIEST and IRON MAIDEN next, OK?Peace!",1
great small group book: Our women's small group went through this book and we really enjoyed it. We were able to explore how God made women and what we can do when walking in his will.,1
"Bought similar pair of GXT-325 - stopped working!: They are less than two months old, only used twice. They worked nicely the first time, now they do not work at all. The store won't take them back (more than 30 days) and Midland wants me to pay to send them to Kansas and then wait 4-6 weeks. This looks like the second review where the product was defective when it was still brand new.",0
"Predictable and Boring: If you are a soap opera fan, then this may fill the bill. Throw in a meddling mother-in-law, a token lesbian affair, a flirtatious but bewildered husband and a few kids, and there you have it. If you find this movie in the $1.00 bin, then it might be worth buying.",0
"For users having trouble with broken gear teeth: Many reviewers of this product have complained about broken plastic gear teeth--a problem I too experienced within a few weeks of using my new blender. I returned the broken blade assumbly to a Braun authorized service center for repair under warranty. A repair technician at the service center told me the broken teeth were caused by the way I was using the blender with frozen ingredients. The service tech told me to use this procedure: Put all the non-frozen ingredients into the jar, put the jar cover on, place it on the motor base, and turn on the blender to any speed. While the blender is on, remove the cap that covers the opening in the lid, and pour or drop frozen ingredients into the jar, continuing to blend until finished.",1
"Indigo Ocean Dreams:: I listen to this CD with my two children, who are two and three, at nap time. We all really enjoy each tale. Each story incorporates calming exercises, which are beneficial to everyone listening. Excellent CD and I will be purchasing the others! I would definitely recommend this for the whole family!",1
"Toshiba 19HLV87 19"" LCD HDTV with Built-In DVD Player-DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX: I had the same thing happen to me. After the unit was programmed for channels in my area, it froze up and the TV did not respond to the remote or the actual controls on the TV. Followed the recommended steps of unplugging for ten minutes however this did not help. There is no reset button on the TV. The manual is very poorly written. I did not purchase the unit through amazon this time but I felt it was important to write a review because as you can see this is identical to the review before me. I hope Toshiba can fix this problem. I will hold off buying another until more research is done.",0
"ok...: I only bought the cd for puddle of grace by amy jo johnson, and I knew there was going to have some boring songs on it...I was right. But I'm still glad because this particular song is excellent.",0
"The Mark Twain Drama: Having been a resident of Elmira, NY for most of my life I was lucky to have seen this production live three times. People from all over the world came by bus to see this remarkable story. The sets were equivalent to a broadway production and the reviews all positive. William Perley was well received by the audience as Mark Twain. A small community with economic troubles could not have sustained this drama for as many years as it did had not the production been so enjoyable and the love of Mark Twain so great.I just recently found the drama in DVD format and am enjoying it once more. I intend to purchase more copies as gifts. This would make a wonderful gift for any Twain lover.",1
"Not a good toaster: I bought it mainly to use as a toaster, with egg poacher as a nice add on. However, it does not toast evenly on both sides! One side comes out nice and brown, but the other side is burned. It's useless for me.",0
"Bushcraft: A good coffee table book,But far too heavy and impractical for taking with you camping/travelling.Illustrations dark and not clear.Same old information,which has already been written by others.",0
"As with others, handles break off: The cup portion of these measuring cups is fine. However, as several others have pointed out, the spot welds on the handles are horrible. For the 1-cup, lasted about 6 months. I expect this could be extended if you don't put them in the dishwasher -- but what's the point? (I'll hand-wash pots and expensive knives, but measuring cups don't get cut that kind of slack.)",0
"Highly Entertaining!: My two-year-old loves this DVD. It is very entertaining for her. She wiggles, dances, and has a blast. I highly recommend any of the Wiggles DVD's. We love the Greg, Murray, Anthony, Jeff, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy, Wags, and the whole crew!",1
"Get the DVD if you want to see this movie: It's a romance. Very sweet. The love scenes and kissing scenes alone would be worth seeing, I believe, by most lesbians or anyone interested in very steamy woman to woman affection. The DVD shows more detail than the VHS does. The entire movie is very artsy in nature and the circus scenes are really fantastic, particularly the two female trapeze artists.",1
"Sheice of Pit: This thing inflated one half of a tire and then stopped blowing air. It will blow if there is no pressure, but hook it up to anything that pushes back and it does absolutely nothing other than get ridiculously hot. Don't buy this useless rubbish.Go to Harbor Freight and you will find any number of superior compressors for less money.",0
"disappointed: I actually ordered 2 bowls at the same time and they each had a different finish on them. One was a bit darker than the other one. One seemed to have more ""antiquing"" on it. I expected them to look the same.",0
"A Bland, Colorless Encounter with Vermeer: Chevalier has painted Vermeer's world, but has forgotten to make it interesting. We enter Vermeer's world through the first-person narrative of Griet, a young sixteen-year old maid. In typical Cinderalla-like fashion, Griet is hated by Vermeer's wife and daughter, Cornelia. Griet, pious and beautiful, maintains her place in the home, gaining the attentions of the male characters.Chevalier tells rather than shows, breaking the first rule of good writing. In addition, her prose is amateurish: simplistic and syntactically dull. Perhaps Chevalier should have spent less time including as many socio-historical tidbits as possible and focused on developing the characters . . . . and the plot.",0
"Too long.: This story was wayy too long, with no real story line and the pages are wayy too thin. 2/5 stars",0
A1 terrific: These grips fit my ATI commander like a glove. They are super comfortable and very well priced. I just wish that they came with replacement screws,1
"Very inspiring, I am capable of doing things too!!: I learned that even famous people have the same fears and worries that normal people do. Also, that wisdom is accumulated by lots of ways and you have to be resilient in life. Take the bad with the good and learn from it.",1
"Normally a fan, but.......: I love Lyn Denison's books, but to me this one was just a retelling of Gold Fever with a little twist. Now THAT is a fun book that will give you some romance butterflies. My advice; buy Gold Fever or Dream Lover (ooh, or The Wild One, I really liked that one a lot).",0
"Not very entertaining: My 5 month son is very active and when we put him in this exersaucer...he gets bored in a matter of minutes. There is not much for him to play with. I looked at other entertainers at the store and there are definitely some better ones out there. Overall, this is not worth buying. Check others out first!",0
We Need ALL Seasons: I am in total agreement with Greg Davis.Except that I want ALL THE SEASONS completely.,0
"HAZARD !: I was poisoned by this product. The non-stick chemical is very non-durable. The covering peel off just in one week after I have started to use it.I contacted the company and they show absolutely no responsibility. Never use the Calphalon`s products ! This is an American company, they do not care about your health, only about their money. Be very careful !",0
Crappy music: Was looking for energetic music to listen to on my Ipod when running or exercising. I love latin music. But after my first attempt to listen to this mix I never listened to it again.,0
We loved this!: This is a great Christmas classic. We wanted our kids to see it. It has great dance scenes and good acting by some of the old and famous actors that every generation should be aware of.,1
"You mean it was 1000 pages?!: This book looks huge and when it was recommended by a friend I thought it looked terrible and trashy.I was so wrong - read it in a week and stayed up very late every night to do so.I loved the way you weren't bored by the history, but enthralled by it",1
great product: I really like this paint. Works great and I like the fact that the paints stay in the container. The only issue I have is opening the paints sometimes cause the covers are kind of close together but that might just be me. :) I use a spoon to scoop out a bit of each paint when I wanna mix the colors. Great product and I recommend it.,1
"Trouble with design: My family purchased this machine as a gift since I was baking so much bread in the old machine I had found from our wedding. The first thing you will notice with this machine is it is VERY LOUD! I got used to that and was enjoying the bread it produced. Then the bread pan kept popping up during kneading; you have to pause the machine and put the pan back in, so you have to stand in front of the loud thing for ages. Next the motor started to seize; you have to manually un-stick the motor! I called customer service and they sent me a replacement. The new one worked fine for a while but the bread pan started popping out again. I called customer service and they sent a new bread pan. That lasted for a couple of cycles, but has now started popping up again!!! I will call them one more time to let them know that this machine has serious design flaws. My husband thinks it is because I use it way more than the average customer, but I feel if it is made well, there should not be problems!",0
"""Filled with fancies and empty of meaning"": Couldn't agree more with the above review. I found this trite, dull, and hugely uninspiring. Telling us repeatedly that Eliot was ""brilliant"" and constantly explicating the poems as Christian sermons is not at all helpful. Telling us that ""because landscape functions as a major symbol, lack of knowledge about the actual sources, as well as insufficient or even incorrect knowledge, can distort or even reverse its symbolic import"", is even less helpful -- particularly when, as it turns out, she herself gets her sources wrong (cf. the mistaken identification of the Lady in The Dry Salvages, later clarified by Helen Gardner).If there is any merit in this book it lies in the nice little anthology of soundbites the author has gleaned from other, more able critics.Oh, and the photos of course :p",0
Jingle Bells: Not quite what I expected. I was hoping that it would be as good as the Rankin Bass Christmas programs.,0
"GOOD STUFF: I took this product with my last pregnancy, number six. I and our entire family have commented over and over how our little girl seems intelligent way beyond the point that any of our other kids were at 3 years old. I didn't think much of it at the time, just that my OB reccommended it and it was something new since my last pregnancy 10 years earlier. I would highly reccommend this supplement, a little pricey but the size of the pills was easy for me to handle so I took it regularly.",1
"OK: The color arrived and it looks nothing like the pic. The color is a pretty color, but it looks more of a reddish, then purple like the photo. And plus it has glitter in it.",0

"Highly reccomended for preschoolers: DRAGON TALES: THE ADVENTURES IN DRAGON LAND comes to us from the creators of ""Sesame Street"". Featuring all of your favorate Dragon pals, (Emmy, Max, Zak & Wheezie, Ord and Quetzal among others.) The disc features five animated adventures: ""To Kingdome Come,"" ""Baby Troubles,"" ""Bad Share Day,"" ""Zak Takes A Drive"" and ""The Forest Of Darkness.""Needless to say, this is really for the very young, I'd say about 2-4 yr olds. Personally I can't say that I'm a fan of the animation, but as a teaching video for small children, it beats Barney any day of the week. And the lessons taught are valuable and easily presented for the age group. This DVD also includes a full frame transfer, English and Spanish 2.0 stereo tracks and 3 sing along with Dragon Tales songs, sure to keeps your kids in song for days.",1
"Not great quality: I know a lot of the other reviews are pretty positive on these, but either reference price or are relatively new reviews. I have a similar set from Cook's and I have to say the finish is not very good. My most used pan already has a finish that is failing (after about 9 months) and the other pans that I use I can see are starting to be worn. Honestly, I had a cheaper T-Fal set after my wedding and they held up better, longer.If these were more expensive, I would have given it a lower rating, but the price of these are low enough that I should not expect premium quality. Just know what you are getting - these are decent pans, but will not last for you.",0
"Disappointing: Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline by the director of Big Chill - how could it be bad? It was terrible. The pace was slow, the story predictable and nothing surprising at all. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't waste your time watching it. So many better movies with these great actors.",0
"Wonderful voice,: A nice collection of songs from a talented singer. She is keeping this ballads alive and deserves to be heard.",1
"Great headphones: They work great for me. Also like the gel ones, but the ones that are circle that hang down hurt my ears..",1
"Great buy, jump on it!: I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan and I'm proud to say that this game is a great beginning to the entire series! Though it is enhanced for the gamers of today who can't go without better graphics or enhancements, it is at the very least a must-play. I think it is better than Anthology because it is faster. Anthology was slow in going in the menu and saving, whereas Origins is very fast. I also like the difficulty settings (easy & normal). It enhances the challenge of the game. Overall, this is a game everyone should play at least once and a must for RPG and adventure fans!",1
Wings not as represented: We have already sent you a complaint about this product. The item was not as advertized so was of no use to us.,0
"Ace is a classic.... this video not his hottest moment: As a longtime KISS fan, I was excited to see this video when it came out. I was disappointed on how the band played and performed together on the video. Todd Howarth, although a fine musician/singer, doesn't seem like the right man to play alongside Ace. Ace looks old and tired, but Rocks out in an admirable fashion. The best parts of the show are the KISS staple ""Cold Gin"" and the track from ALIVE II ""Rocket Ride."" These two tunes show Ace playing what he does best. Some of the other tunes seem like a reaction to the glam rock scene of the late 80's. I like the video as a fan of Ace. As a critic of fine music, not so much. On another note, I was a little disturbed by Ace's cowboy boots!!! This video is definitely for die-hard Ace fans. Probably not for others.",1
"Breath of Fresh Air: I highly recommend this cd! Clay is a breath of fresh air! Not only does he appeal to all ages, but his charm, his approachable nature and, most importantly, his voice will attract a huge following for many, many years to come! Count me in for the long hall. Well done Clay. For those of you who have not yet heard Mr. Aiken take the leap, you won't be disappointed. May the judges who hated ""This Is The Night"" eat their words! This song will stand the test of time.",1
"Not even a G11 will fit that well: This bag is very portable, but doesn't fit my Panasonic GF1 with pancake lens. I don't think it will fit a G11 either. It's simply for someone with a point and shoot that could probably fit in a pocket or purse anyway rendering the bag useless. It's a truly bad design. For only $12 though, I really don't regret the purchase. I'll give it away to a friend.",0
"Find Your Story: Frank's book is a classic work on the stories that organize our lives. While he uses illness narratives as his case in point, the application of his work is much broader, from looking at how we have, consciously or unconsciously, set our lives up to work all the way out to looking at cosmology and spirituality.",1
"Yet another great Detective.: Peter Davison is superb, in this highly unusual series.The supporting cast, too, are all highly enjoyable and convincing. The fact that Davison the hard working, plodding but, in the end brilliant detective, is such a wuss regarding his estranged wife, was brilliant in its conception. It is always good to have heroes who have Achilles heels!This series is brilliant and extremely well directed. Everyone, who enjoys a good detective yarn and a genuine smile, should see it.",1
"They make games this boring?: If you enjoy games where you move around in this little cart that moves roughly two miles an hour taking pictures of mutated animals, than this game is perfect for you. If you enjoy more exciting games, don't even consider purchasing this game. Pointless, stupid, absolutley disgusting. If they a game more boring than this, i'll...well, it doesn't matter, because it's near impossible to make a game worse than this, nintendo would be at an all time low. I got bored of this game in two minutes.",0
"Yo-Joe! Favorite 80's Cartoons: I love the 80's cartoons. They were great! One of my favorite was G.I. Joe. This was great cartoon. It had everything. Good vs Evil, Action, and every so offen you had a little romance. G.I. Joe volume 4, is because it features my two favorite Joes:Flint and Lady J.So if you remember G.I. Joe when it was one TV, then you need to own or at the very lease rent this movie so you two can remember why you loved it the first time around.",1
"Possible DVD Release: Does anyone know if this movie is ever going to be put onto DVD? This would be an excellent choice for Anchor Bay to release.

"Jiminy Critic on Space Balls: This is a comedy thais a total whackout that was made to toast on Star Wars. My favorite Character was Yogurt, who portrayed Chewbacca the Wookie. My favorite scene was when that frog-like creature comes out of the man's chest and starts dancing.This DVD may not be the best DVD ever, but it's on my top ten list. Mel Brooks has made one of the greatest movies of all time. I give this book a ***** rating for its humor.",1

"(cyberpunk) + (beat) = conventional poo: This book was recommended to me, heightening my disappointment. Yet further proof why I must trust no one. I guess even cyberpunk has its own set of cliches. Read this book and fly into every one of them. So Noon read Shampoo Planet et al,...Kool-Aid Acid Test, and digs Burroughs, etc. What you get is an unimaginative, recycled verbal montage of quirky characterizations, boring drug experiences, and an ill-conceived plot--all from someone who's never lived the dream. Yawn. For every Samuel Coolridge and William Gibson, there are approx. 3,582 Jeff Noons.",0
"Excellent QR head: I mounted the Bogen-Manfrotto 3229 Swivel Tilt Head with Quick Release on a 3-section Manfrotto monopod. The head, like the monopod, is extremely solid and the quick release safety provides a very secure attachment. I believe that the quick release plate works with all other Bogen-Manfrotto quick release heads. If you're looking for a tripod head, I'd recommend something like the 486RC2 Compact Ballhead, but the 3229 tilt-swivel head is ideal for use with a monopod.",1

"If not their greatest, certainly close to it: Along with ""Doolittle,"" Trompe holds up as the best top to bottom Pixies album. Not one weak song and some of their greatest like ""Letter to Memphis,"" ""Palace of the Brine"" and ""Motorway to Roswell."" So Kim Deal does not play a major role on the album, who cares? The Pixies always were Joey Santiago and Frank Black. An addictive album that will have you listening to it over and over.",1
"More Like ""Royal Rape"": The so-called ""hero"" of this book is nothing more than a rapist. For goodness sake, the first time they get together, he throws her down, holds her down and rapes her, and yet this is somehow supposed to be seen as romantic.This book is sickening. It does not deserve to be called a romance novel.",0
"Put Yourself In Darlie's Shoes: Chris Brown took (and is still taking) a personal interest in the Routier case. It's hard to believe that a regular ""Joe"" could prove Darlie's innocence when lawyers and law enforcement did not bother. Evidence in grocery bags--for God's sake! Anyone who can vote for George W. Bush with this type of shoddy investigation going on in his state is committing a crime. Darlie is innocent and this book, though not well written, proves it without a doubt! Poor Darlie!",1

Better on tv than disc.: I loved the show when it aired and was really looking forward to getting it on dvd. When it got it and watched the first disc I was really shocked to find it was not captioned or subtitled. I am almost deaf and really need them to fully understand what is going on. The discs are poor quality and really look grainy. The saving grace is that the episodes are a few minutes longer than the tv versions.,0
what: I'm not sure where to start just like the movie doesn't know where to start. First take a badly written story then place it in a blender and tape it back together.,0
"Stunningly detailed photos! Great gift for anyone!: I really enjoyed the detail in each of the photos of this book. In addition, each was labeled with the type of butterfly as well as where they are typically found. There are also a few very appropriate quotes in this beautiful coffee table edition. I received it as a gift, and I think it would make a great gift for anyone - older children interested in bugs, curious adults or even grandparents. This book is for anyone who enjoys the beauty in nature!",1
"too much mess - not enough fun: (...) Here's one from a parent of 6 & 7 year old girls. This toy is a ripoff!! The snow is a huge(!!!!!) mess. From the looks of the box - it is a house full of wonder - it is really silly. My girls are as creative and imaginative as you get - this toy just isn't doing it for them. Got it yesterday - moving it to the basement playroom this afternoon (once we get the snow cleaned). Ok, I sound bitter - but there are such better ways to spend your time and money!",0

"Meh.: I have a quest. I'm a huge fan of Ewan McGregor, so I want to see all of his movies. I was pretty excited to see Velvet Goldmine because I heard it was good. Sadly, I was misinformed. Maybe it's because I'm not into glam rock or something, but nothing about this movie really did it for me. I thought it was rather dull, actually. I expected McGregor, as the top-billed actor, to have a larger role, and while I did see a lot of him (all of him, in fact... wink, wink), I wanted to know more about his character and see more of his performance.In general, I found this movie lacking. There wasn't enough plot to keep me interested, and the music wasn't good enough to keep it going for me. I thought this movie was rather blah.",0

"a must for dancehall fans: if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing....",1

"Japan Is so Insecure about losing a war it started.: This is so stuped of a script you've got to see it to beleive it. To use Godzilla to make Japan look better in WWII in this or any way is sad. They depict the west (America) as a crul economic aggresor trying to crush poor little Japan using Ghidora and of course the west (America) has to go back in time to do this. After all Japan has economic control of Brazil, the hole of Africa and some other places in the future. It sounds like the Axis only has one member left! The only good thing in this movie is the fight senes. Also Godzilla is in it.",0

"Not a self teaching guide.: This book has a lot of material that makes it worthy to be called a reference book, but as a self teaching guide it really comes up short. There is quite a bit of math (which is good in a physics book), but too little in the way of helping someone new to physics really understand the concepts. I considered returning this book for a refund, but decided to hang on to it for future reference. I think it will be useful to me after I've used some other book(s) to help be learn the fundamentals.",0

"**: I bought this after a rave in FORBES, but it's kind of a hybrid memoir/business advice book that doesn't really work.

"Vintage Bromberg: I saw David Bromberg in concert many times in the 70's at Devon PA. He had a great mix of blues and rock that I enjoyed immensely. This CD is wonderful and I've been playing it over and over since I bought it. It's truly vintage Bromberg and I feel like I'm sitting there in the concert in the round at Devon again when it plays. ""Sharon"" is my favorite. Terrific CD. You won't be disappointed.",1

"Basic Main Street American Eats: The book covers one or two sandwiches from each state with interesting period, black-and-white photos of street scenes, which are mostly from the 1920s - 1950s. There are no photos of the sandwiches. The recipes are almost too primitive - greasy-spoon more than main-street diner. Not much to learn here.",0

Not just for dog trainers: This book was so much more fun than I expected. Karen Pryor does a great job of generalizing animal training to include food for thought regarding training of the human animal as well.

"A zany rhyme filled with unlikely dilemmas reinforcing the rule of why it's important never to talk to strangers: First published in 1967, NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS pairs a zany rhyme filled with unlikely dilemmas reinforcing the rule of why it's important never to talk to strangers. George Buckett's drawings accompany animal/human interactions emphasizing the fact of safety - even under the unlikeliest of circumstances.",1
Hammer's House of Horror is frightfully good!: I am a collector of all Hammer movies but took me a whileto finally get this collection. i paid basically nothingfor it! I thought the price was too much when released.Well it was worth having. I watched Peter Cushing episodefirst and Cushing makes it great. If you liked Hammermovies and 80's horror tv shows you'll like this. It hasthat 80's feel too it with just enough horror and comedyto make it work. Not much gore thankfully! Stories wellwritten and directed as most good british mystery and horror.,1

"Unique Approach to both Winnie the Pooh and Pop-ups.: This is a new approach to a traditional story. Your basic vignettes for Winnie-the-Pooh are there in a scruptuous 3D layout [more than pops up it has some interactive tabs as well]. At its furthest reaches, it lays out width wise to about 4 1/2ft - not a page turning book. Each of the seperate scenes are then brought up and/or down [either all at once or one at a time, your preference]...three are in the trees to the ground so are a good height as well. One includes Tigger being pulled up and down the tree and another has Eyeore floating down the river whilst Christopher Robin and Pooh are playing Pooh Sticks.Each of the sections has a pull down section of story that can't be pulled out. It is an all around, lay down, 3 people play at once view of a fantasic story. Perfect for pop-up enthusiasts, Pooh lovers, or for a [Grand]parent and [Grand]child to play with.",1
"Egad....: The text is printed on demand, as it's not requested frequently.The website for the book says, ""We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies so that could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price. And nobody wants to pay that.

"Only for RPG Gamers: First of all, if you are a sports gamer or FPS gamer this game really isn't for you. Its more for people that are fans of RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons type RPGs. If you are not of that type of gamer don't waste the $[...] bucks for the game. Other than that its a magnificent game. the only problem I had was that the whole adaptive leveling thing is annoying. And the ending is pretty anti-climatic as well. All that build up and then whoosh, it's over. But the game has numerous side quests that can keep you entertained for hours on end. The only thing i have as advice would be to make sure you have a character concept in mind before the game starts. Makes life easier. A good balance of magic, armor wearing, and weapons are good. Try not to specialize. Some parts of the game are pretty difficult if you specialeze in just magic, or being a basher type character.",1

What the hell?!?I paid to see this in a theater, and viewing it once was more then enough.This one is a RENTAL at best...",0
"I REEEALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN!: This movie truly freaked me out with its terrifying psychological plot when I first saw it at 22-years old while living in a new place. During the film ""something"" crashed in my bedroom and neither me nor my roommates would investigate. I ended up staying in the living room that night.Just a few months ago, I came across the Entity and decided to stay up and watch to see if it still scared me. Well...even as I write this short review, I am struggling not to hear the thundering sound effects of the attacks and (yikes!) YES! I didn't want to go up to bed after seeing this film even all these years later. I also don't wish to view this movie a third time, however I know I probably will. There is nothing like a great mind-fright!",1

If you love this band, Good for you!However, for some of us, who would only like to purchase ONE song of the whole album, I feel it's very sad that this feature it's not available. The only song I like is ""An Offer She Can't Refuse"", and -as someone wisely stated- is a song that has nothing to do with the rest of the album. It's like it doesn't even belong to the same band. I refuse to spend $13 on an album that only has one song I like.Please Amazon, sell them individually!",0
"Excellent Book: When I was looking for GMAT preparation books, I reviewed many books from different publishers. Even though Nova Press is a less known brand than Barron, Kaplan, or Princeton Review, the content and exercises helped me score in the top 4 I got accepted into a Top 10 b-school, and when I decided to build a GMAT app, I remember Nova's book.

"One of the worst Verdi recitals in history!!!: Angela Gheorghiu has a small voice. She should not be tackling these great spinto arias that Verdi wrote. Her voice is just too small and weak. Her ""Pace, pace mio Dio"" is underweight vocally. There was some digital fakery going on in ""O patria mia"". Shame on this Rumanian whoreslatch for resorting to studio tricks in order to ""sing"" the high C. This guttersnipe singing Verdi spinto arias is like Maria Callas trying to act funny or Rita Streich singing Br√ºnnhilde's Immolation Scene from ""Die G√∂tterd√§mmerung"". It's like Callas trying to get through the Mad Scene cadenza from ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" without expiring or at least, embarrassing herself.",0
"The only stranger tides this thing is sailing on are in the toilet bowl: If I could have asked for double my money back I would have. At least they gave me back what I paid for this mish mash of no story, predictability, fun-free bag of noises and fast cutting disguised as a movie. I have enjoyed mr. Marshall's films in the past (Chicago - great! Nine - not great but entertaining) and was looking forward to seeing what he would do with Pirates. Now I just want to slap some sense into him. Mr. Verbinski made the right decision to let this turd float away.",0
"A Great Overview of the Building Process: Locke does an excellent job of discussing the process of building a new house. As a builder/contractor, his perspective is clearly that of the contractor, but he admits his bias and if you read it with this bias in mind, it is extremely helpful.His detailed explanation of the foundation, framing and roofing process (the areas he has direct experience building) are very interesting and will help anyone know more about what they are buying/building. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about building or remodeling a home.",1
"Great, big, and comfortable: Great quality bed for my dog. She really likes it. If you choose to buy this bed, go by the size (length) of your dog instead of his weight. Per the suggested weights, I should have purchased the next size down even though my dog's frame is that of a larger dog with a very lean build. So based on her actual size, the large bed was the perfect fit.",1
"Exactly what I was looking for!: I use my notebook computer as a desktop replacement, and I'm not wild about using the touchpad all the time. This little mouse is the *perfect* alternative. The plug-and-play functionality is seamless -- it doesn't matter when you plug it in; it always starts right up with no rebooting required. It features 3 buttons and a scroll wheel, so unless you're used to using a really souped-up mouse, you won't sacrifice anything you'd have on a regular mouse.The most convenient feature, without a doubt, is the cord. It winds up neatly into the base, and the USB plug snaps into the bottom. No tangles, no unruly cords, no retractor-widgets prone to breakage. Brilliant. The mouse is small, but I honestly don't notice the difference while I'm using it.All in all, this mouse is a winner in both form and function. It gives me exactly what I need from a mouse in an incredibly convenient little package. I highly recommend it.",1
"Logitech...Lottatrash: After using this game controller only about 2 months it quit working properly. Left analog stick went weird. Everytime I tried to play a game using it the character or whatever kept moving forward. To stop this action I had to pull the left analog stick toward me. When I let go of it it continued again moving forward. I changed the batteries twice still the same. I checked every possible thing that may be causing the problem but no luck. I did not abuse the controller in any way. What a waste of money. I still have the original controllers that came with my PS2 and they still work great, and I bought it three years ago!!",0
"Penguin's Worst Edtion: Like James Broadbent (see reader review), I was shocked to discover this edition of Little Dorritt was slipshod. Penguin stands for excellence. I have bought Penguins for years without regret. So imagine my surprise when the notes referred to an introduction and appendices that have not been reprinted here.I assumed it was a defective book until I read James Broadbent's review. He is absolutely right: Stephen Walls's introduction and Helen Small's notes from an earlier edition have been omitted. I intend to buy that edition now.I have discovered, however, that you can read Stephen Walls's introduction in a preview of the Penguin at Google Books:[...]",0
"Broke in the first five minutes!: This is an awful product. I bought it so my Girl Scout troop could make ice cream in a new way. In the first five minutes, one of the girls dropped the ball into soft grass and the ball shattered! The manufacturer will not provide a new one or a refund because their warranty doesn't cover drops. That's what I get for being honest. My opinion, something designed for children should be able to withstand being dropped into soft grass by an 8-year old!",0

"Very cute but one problem....get your sewing needle!: I bought this backpack for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it. It is very soft and roomy, and is really cute. She often pulls out the map and pretends to be Dora (it's attached to the pack for safe keeping).At first sight the magnet closure was pretty secure, and once closed stayed closed until my daughter wanted it open. But the SECOND DAY the magnet on the pack came loose and was lost in the lining of the pack. The one on the flap is still secure.I located the magnet and sewed it back in place (it looks a little rough but it won't get lost again!) I can't say that I know for sure that my daughter didn't cause this, but since she only had it for 2 days and is pretty easy on her toys, I suspect it is a defect or poor workmanship.However, it is totally fixable and worth it since this is the only backpack out there that is just like Dora's and not hard plastic. It really is cute and she loves it.",1
"Save Your Money!: I was drawn to this album after seeing the ever popular car commerical....which is was a good way to discover Telepopmusik but not this group. The song from the commerical is the best song on the album. The rest is very light weight and repetitive. As an alternative, I would suggest Bunnka by Paul Oakenfold. That album is a much more solid and developed dance/trance work. Oakenfold is a much more well developed artist then these guys hands down!",0
It's great even if you don't know the original series...: This was recommended to me after my wife remembered Conjunction Junction and other songs. It's great value too. 2 DVDs and a lot of fun. My kids really like it.,1

"As biblical as DaVinci Code is historical...: Just reading the assertions made in this book shows me that the author hasn't a grasp on what is means to interpret biblical prophecy. Rather than trying to refute the obvious failings of this book, I'd recomment that if the author wants to write fiction, perhaps he should take a lesson from Dan Brown and come up with some really strange ideas that no one in their right mind would believe if they were to actually do their own research.",0
"Love It: Absolutely love how this looks on my bed. I purchased the olive color. It is much richer (greener, not so washed out) than it looks in the picture. It is a very nice color and of excellent quality. And very comfy too. So far it has held up very well to my two cats and my dog. I bought the king size for my queen size bed (like a little extra on the bottom edge to tuck in). I expected it to be a bit larger, but since it is for the queen, it works very well. I do find my comforter does slide around in the duvet cover. Not sure if it is because of the more sheer underside lining, or just that I have a queen comforter in a king size duvet. Overall, I am extremely pleased. Feels great and looks very classy. Much nicer than the plain cotton duvet I was using. And the price is great (paid $30-something, which, if you've been duvet cover shopping, is what you might find a cheap cover for if you are lucky).",1

Flowtron has poor product support and customer service.",0
"Not quite what I expected.: The first problem I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box.Both connectors were covered by labels, which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off. I spent about an hour just trying to get them clean enough to use.Second problem came when I popped in the ""software"" disc. It turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didn't even work. I spent another 20-30 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked.The cable itself worked fine after I managed to clean the connectors off, find the appropriate drivers, and download Windows Media Player. Be aware, if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmware, you won't be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable.",0
LOVE IT!!!!: I love the product they came in top condition I would recommend this way of shopping to anyone.,1
"Too, too small: This camera fits in the palm of my hand. My fault: I didn't check the dimensions before ordering. This camera is way too small to even be seen. I pointed it out to my neighbor and he said ""Where? Where is it? I don't see it."" I was shocked at how small it is as the photos of it make it look like it's about 12"" long when it's really about 4 or 5 inches long. Disappointed!",0

"Debut Classic: I've heard horrible comparisons and blaming Jackson for copying other artists such as Daft Punk. This album IS house, but very very original at that, and probably the greatest debut album I've heard from any artist in years. Each song is put together brilliantly with montages of samples and glossy 80's texture. The album has a general dark atmosphere, but the end result isn't depressing at all but ecstatic.Smash isn't just your old house album, it feels like an album. The only regret is the album seems to be a little short, but each song really seems to have its fullest effort, with some short fun in-betweens like ""MOTO"". So far I'm surprised to see this album get a bad-wrap...seriously astonished because this really feels like a classic. Anyone who thinks that this is bad has some screws loose!",1
Don't own but....: I can't imagine why anyone would buy headphones that even look like the ones that come with an iPod. The iPod ones SUCK. Probably the crappiest headphones I've ever used... I'm just saying...,0

"Not what I expected: I labored over getting a fabric steamer for months and months. After reading everyones reviews, I finally chose this model. It is cumbersome and though it took wrinkles out, it is no substitute for ironing.",0
"Ugh! This was just painful.: I've read 3 or 4 other titles by Patricia Cornwell and found them interesting and creative. This book, however, failed to fall in to either of those categories. The book is full of weak characters and a story line that really never takes you anywhere.",0
"A terrible read. I found it incredibly difficult to follow.: <excerpt> ""..You might assume that because of the increase in use of the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) in software development and the emphasis on software interoperability across non-Microsoft ""cultures"" (e.g., Novell, Unix, and Machintosh), a major Widows 2000 theme is a scalable organizational structure.""What!?! While the contents of the book appears to be presented in a logical order, it reads like a list of unrelated thoughts. You may think this is an isolated example but it's not. That excerpt was from Chapter 2 - Security Overview. I assure you there is plenty more where that came from.I would definately not recommend this book, and it just reinforces my belief that since the NT 4 series, the quality of Coriolis books has seriously suffered. I'll stick with Sybex.",0
"The best introduction of David Lanz's world of music: I like to hear new age music since a few years ago and the first masterpiece which leads me get into this horizon is the ""Cristofori's Dream"" by David Lanz. It lets me know that there's some music which can really dissolve one's heart, make your so comfortable. It's the first cut in a Narada's 10 year collection. Then one day I found this album from the CD store and brought it back to home undoubtedly. As expected, it didn't make me disappointed. And since then I love his music.",1
i love the cheetahgirls alot: i think that the cheetah girls are the bomb other people think there stupid but they are so cool,1
"Waste of Trees: I read the book. Was bored to tears.I also found it strange that there were apparently hundreds of people who were well acquainted with anachronistic forms of medieval combat but there were ABSOLUTELY ZERO martial artists (except for the one that Mike beat up in his reminiscing). This was 1998 America - so this was before MMA became all the rage, but there still should have at least been a few Karate or TKD people, even as ""red shirts"".And as for the cannibalism...he lost me when the heroes found a doctor who was about to become dinner. It was clear that he felt that the book needed some black-and-white bad guys and settled on zombie-esque cannibals. I mean, no one would have tried to eat a doctor. They would hold him captive, yes. Force him to treat them, yes. But he would not be killed for food when there are plenty of accountants, salesmen, and data analysts who have no marketable skills in the post-change world mucking about.Just garbage.",0
"Methods that are 30 years out of date: What an appalling book! You should never, ever hit your dog. If your dog has a problem that serious, you should consult a professional trainer -- not listen to a book written by a woman whose training ideas are from the 1950s. These methods could also seriously injure or emotionally traumatize a small or sensitive dog.Hitting, choking and slapping haven't been used by intelligent trainers for decades. There are other, gentler ways (like leash corrections or clicker training) of getting your dog to behave.",0
"Movie good but WEAK when compared to book: The movie ""the Lost World"", is one of film history's greatest achievements. This book and it's detail put the movie to shame!!! The book has 10X more suspense, action, and thrills than the movie could ever offer. A definite must read.",1
"It wasn't that bad...: I've been a non-conforming artist type since I was a kid so my liking this movie while the so-called ""average"" masses hate it seems typical of me. I went in with very low expectations based on all the reviews I read. I was pleasantly surprised. I liked this movie a lot. The only thing I'd change is the giant Robot type thing would step on the kid. God, what an annoying little dick!",1
"Summer Magic: I loved Summer Magic! It is the typical Disney movie that I grew up with back in the 50's and I wouldn't be afraid for my grandchildren to sit with me while watching it. Dorothy Maguire, Haley Mills and Burl Ives are wonderful in this family picture. Anyone wanting to watch a movie that is lighthearted and fun, this I recommend and have your grandchildren with you....they'll enjoy seeing how things were in the ""olden days"".",1
"A Fun Tour of Rarely-Seen Gems: I loved the stories behind each of these houses. I own several books on midcentury mod and this is the first that truly captures the modern aesthetic, from the book's design to the photography to the writing. Excellent!",1
"Danna es Chiquita Pero Muy Picosa-Very Small But Very Sassy: Danna strikes again in her 3rd CD! I love her voice in this album. It is a lot more developed than in her last album(not saying her last album sucked, it was actually very good) Her songs are very catchy and you will want to listen over and over again.",1
Mother of three: I bought three of the Dora Friendship Adventure Doll for Christmas 2007. I have twin girls 4 and a 3 year old girl. The only reason I bought these dolls was because it was on sale for $39.99 from amazon and also I thought my three girls would really be excited to have it. However the were excited for the first 5 minutes and after that they never play with the doll again. The doll is too heavy. The head is extremely big. It is dangerous for any toddler without adults supervising. I believe if this doll should fall on a child age two or under they would be serously hurt. I am concerned for my own daughters.Please think carefully before you buy this because I think sometime in the near future there might be a recall because of too many kids getting hurt.,0
"Good, but not as vertical as I'd prefer: The stand looks good and does the job, but it leans the guitar a bit further back than I would prefer. I would have given it 5 stars if I could adjust it to hold the guitar more vertically, so I could push it closer to the wall.",1
"cute but not what I needed: I'm new to cats. We have hard wood floors and the litter gets everywhere so i decided to buy one of these due to the rating. It's cute but it really does not work well. At least not in the way that I expected. It seems to catch some litter, but by some, I mean a few pieces. I gave up and went to the hardware store. Bought a indoor outdoor carpet made of material that is threaded more like a door mat. I paid $10.00 for 3'x6', more then enough. Cut it down a bit and its perfect. I found the cats need more than this Omega Litter Mat to get their paws clean.",0

"EVERYTHING EXCEPT!!!!!!!!!: I am a single man that loves to cook. The Crockpot is perfect for a dinner for two and left overs for lunch the next day.The ceramic liner is sublime, my only regret is that the decoration design is totally hooky. Straight from the Fifties, I know there is a stainless steel one available but it defeats the perpose as it just generates heat.(And costs more!) Something like a simple band of green rather than the cute ivy please. It is 2002.",1
"Not one single boring moment.: I picked this book up and could not put it down. I have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's novels and I am never diappointed. The characters were intriguing and the story pulled me in so much that I found myself actually angree, frustrated and happy with every twist and turn. A true page turner.",1
"Black Ink Anyone?: There are so many times where the actual ink, can be the difference between a good copy, and a not-so-good copy on paper. With HP black ink cartridge #21, it is very convient, and easy to setup into your HP deskjet 3930 series printer. This cartridge is very inexpensive, and affordable for HP printers. I think of it as a must for your HP printers. While there are cartridges that are difficult to open, and install into your printers, this one installs in a snap. I really recommend this for my new HP printer, and so will you if you own a HP printer for this ink as well.Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+",1
"Couldn't put it down: The mark of a good novel is its ability to expand your mind while entertaining and teaching you. This book stands up to all three of those conditions very well. Entertaining, very. Captivating and definitely a page-turner. Lots of drama, for those of us who enjoy it, sexuality, some humor, well-written. Educational in its examination of Indian culture. Thought-provoking through its exploration of sexuality in its many forms. I found myself less than sympathetic toward the protagonist, and it was sometimes to the point where I disliked her. However, we can learn a lot more from those different to us than we can from those who are the same. The ideas presented in this book were quite insightful. A great coming-of-age tale.",1
"Its just ....ok: The first ""Cruel Intentions"" was highly underrated. There was a strong chemistry within the cast (obviously since Reese & Ryan married!) and the characters weren't one dimensional. Even evil Kathryn was capable of pain that Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to convey in brief moments which was perfect for that character. But Cassidy for CI3 falls way short of being three dimensional. She's just cruel for the whole film and showed no weakness. Everyone has a weakness. However, I will say that the character Patrick somewhat intrigued me. He went beyond the game of cruelty and ...well, I won't give away what happens, but I was very disturbed by it. As for Kerr, he was alright. Its not his fault his character was kind of dull. Anyway, the film is ""ok"". Its worth watching if you run into it on cable, but I wouldn't buy the movie.",0
"as expected & gets the job done: Price? Great. Build quality? Great, it is not cheap feeling. Fits the other reviews? Pretty much. Would buy again? Definitely as I only need low volume. Unjams easily? YES! Ok, well that it does jam is a bummer, but only 1 or 2 over hundreds of brads. I would definitely recommend for anyone needing low volume use and wants to save their money.The only CON: Sometimes it shoots 2 brads. That may not even be the nailer per se. Maybe I am triggering wrong. Maybe it is just my unit and not all. While a bit annoying, I would still get it again.",1
"A book 150 pages too long: Few business books are really interesting and brief enough to be read. First...is not one of them. The authors talk and talk, example after example. It is 150 pages too long! It is a pity they did not do a better job with the Gallup material!! Not worth.",0
"the talented Mr. Higbie: We travelled to Thailand over the summer and found the phrasebook easy to use and very helpful- it's a must if you're headed there, for getting around, ordering food, discovering places off the beaten track, and getting to know local people. Don't leave home without it.",1
Books : Children and Men: A chatty but pashionate manifesto about the children's literature. Slightly dated but still exciting.,1
boring!!!: i read this book becuase i heard how great it was. it has so many great reviews. honestly i think the book was just ok... too much of nothing was written. i found myself forcing to finish the book thinking it was going to get better. the best part was the end. now i can read a better book. sorry jane austen but this now makes me think twice about reading your other books. i was disappointed.,0
"Enigma hits the right spot again!: To all those fellow Enigma fans, this is a great album. They still preserve all those qualities that we love, all the beautiful rhythms and melodic sounds. Although this album was beautiful, I felt that I should expect a little more. Maybe a few more 'complete' songs, perhaps a few more rememberable songs.... I recommend this cd for all Enigma fans and all ambiance lovers, but I would first listen to ""Love Sensuality Devotion"" and if you're torn as to which cd to get first, I suggest the latter. Don't get me wrong, ""Screen"" is very well put together and is very beautiful, but ""Love Sensuality Devotion"" is much more rememberable.",1
Wire Study Stand-silver: I'm really pleased with this item; is very useful I'm able to read without bending my neck or back allowing me to keep a proper sitting or standing position. This product is good quality and has an excellent price.,1
"1 1/2 STARS: For Dream Theater- this is not very good- i never thought i'd give a band like DT a 1 1/2 stars- but im comparing this album to others that they have done- Awake is my favorite, followed by Images in words- then Scenes from a memory- falling is next- then 6 degrees- this is last on the list- hope their new one is prog- and not metal! Sorry DT!! I still love ya--",0
"Amazing Band!!: I first heard Dizmas when I was in Monterey for SWC, and it was early in the morning so I wasn't expecting much of a good show. But when they began to play I was immediately amazed by how good their music was! To those not fond of screaming? It goes so well with the music that you won't mind it or you might actually like it by the time you're finished with a few of their songs. They have such a passion for their music, and it really shows! They are amazing and I would recommend this music to anyone and everyone.",1
"funny...but: It's not bad. I guess it is one of the first episodes. It's a great show but they're still learning where and when to make their funny comments. One good thing, the one girl who's a psychic, I'm pretty sure she's Roberta on the Disney movie, Swiss Family Robinson. Pretty cool she's on this too",1
Boring junk: I gave this one star just because you can not give zero stars.the writing is stunted and changes tense on the fly. Sometimes you can not tell the author has changed who is speaking or thinking. I had too many times where I had to re-read several sentences to figure out who was saying what about whom. 85 pages in and it still had nothing to keep me reading. I gave up. Money in the toilet!,0
"Let's go 2.5 stars: It's a fun toy for my 4-year-old and probably would be for kids a few years older too, but where it scores points for fun, it gets dings for construction quality. It's easily knocked over, and when it falls, several links of track usually fall apart. The plastic is rigid and the parts fit together (more accurately, stay together) poorly. (which also could describe the Pontiac G6 rental car I drove around last week, but that's another review). The other complaints you've read about this toy's durability aren't isolated.",0
"New to Vietnamese Cuisine...: I wasn't very familiar with Vietnamese cooking, but I bought this book because I loved the other books in the series so much. While I don't use this one as much as the others, I've found it's just as easy to use. The recipes come out delicious! I especially like how I, as someone unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine, can create nice meals with the help of the book. I was amazed at how easy spring rolls really are, and I'm grateful for the glossary in the back of the book that explains what the unfamiliar ingredients are.Eng Tie Ang has obviously dedicated her life to food, and it shows in these books. The recipes take a few short cuts here and there, but the quality doesn't suffer as a result. This makes them even more useful for the mother who's cooking for the family. I love that!",1
"One of the best Cult Culture Comic book: The story in this book is not becoming my concern at all. What amazed me, it's the illustrations, the details and the unique characters like 'Big Guy and Rusty'. The book is more than just a comic but consider my best own comic collection from one of the best cult culture comic book.",1
"The Best was Left with Lillywhite: To anyone who claims ""Everyday"" to be a good showing of Dave's talent...well then you're right. To anyone who claims ""Everyday"" to be a good showing of The Dave Matthew's Band...well you couldn't be more lost. Dave should of saved Carter and Tinsley's time and just hired some studio musicians for this lack luster performance. I refuse to ever believe that Dave has gone cuckoo, but firing Lillywhite for Ballard was just awful. Think of it this way, Lillywhite produced Phish, which although some Dave fans might not care, they do play a similiar genre of music. However, Ballard produced Alanis?! Were is the connection? Unless Dave is on some sort of pop-MTV binge, then he needs to listen to his fans, which from my understanding, are quite confused by ""Everyday""",0
"Pathetic Design: I've had the Mr. Coffee 4-cup switch (?) coffee maker for about a month, using it once or twice daily. The spring-loaded valve that enables ""Stop-n-Pour"" has fallen out 6 times. The plastic O-ring on the valve is beginning to break down. The pot is very difficult to put into or take out of the unit, requiring two hands. The pot leaks coffee onto the counter during the first pour, no matter how it is done. When the pot is taken out of the unit, coffee drips onto the heater plate, resulting in a scorched-coffee smell. It's hard to imagine how such a design failure made it into production. At $19.99, this is overpriced by about $19.98. A terrible piece of kitchen equipment.",0
"Sadly disappointed: We loved The Letter Factory and The Talking Words Factory, we expected to like this one too. The introduction to the ""learning part"" was almost ten minutes long (or almost a third of the video) of just fluff, no skills presented. The actual ""learning part"" was closed captioning with the words highlighted as they were read. There was no explanation of how to sound out the words (other than a quick plug of the Letter and Word Factory), Tad knew all the words- in this video he just was learning how to chunk them together. A better choice would be to watch PBS's Super Why. Very sadly disappointed Leap Frog.",0
"Some excellent ideas: Our entire parish has been reading this book together. Some of the practices the author describes are exciting to think about adopting. I am especially grateful to note that these practices are rooted in Christian tradition rather than church-marketing strategies. The greatest danger to mainline denominations today is striving to increase membership at the cost of faithfulness to the Gospel. The things that bring crowds into churches are not necessarily of God. Jesus wasn't popular in First Century Palestine, and faithfulness to the Gospel today can make Christians unpopular with those whose definition of Christianity has more to do with personal success and achievement than with compassion and sacrifice.",1
Tie Rack: No problems thus far. Filled the tie rack to the brim and it held itself together while still twirling. It does the work of what other ties racks 10 times it price do. Easy pick!Evriholder offered great customer service as well. I didn't realize that this product was coming all the way from China and thus going to take at least two weeks to get to me and they gave me a full refund and let me keep the product.,1

"Great deal, and still not worth it: I purchased this ring during a sale with an additional 40% off, so I got it for $50. It still wasn't worth the money because it's ungiftable. It's very pretty at first glance, but a closer look revealed that the accent stones on either side of the center were extremely crooked and randomly sized. A couple of them had visible chips in their highly polished surfaces, easily visible under light. They look like random shards crammed into the setting. It's quite tacky when you look closely, and I'm returning it.I was very disappointed, this was supposed to be a Christmas gift and I was looking forward to giving it. The design and center stones are gorgeous, a tiny bit more effort in the manufacture to better match and straighten the accent stones would have made a huge difference in the quality of this ring.",0
"Blasphemous: This release is a blasphemous release. It butchers the Beatles' music in ways I could never have nightmares about. It is an uncreative, pointless album. Most of the songs play as normal, with a few interspersed samples from other songs thrown in for good measure. It's like they didn't even try to create huge differences, so it isn't even that creative. Furthermore, the remixes completely ripped the soul out of the music as originally intended. It rips out some of the best parts of songs, such as the end of Revolution or the chorus at the end of Hey Jude. It uses the crescendo sample from A Day in the Life far too much. In a nutshell, it massacres and dessicates the way these songs should be heard. If you MUST hear this music, copy a friend's CD, but don't say I didn't warn you.",0
"too bad there isn't a zero stars option: This book was a big waste of time/money. The premise of the book is make friends with girls, be their therapist/doormat and wait for them to ""attack"" you for relationship/sex. Been there done that. I have had many close female friends over the years and have done ALL the things this book said to do/ not do. I have never had one of them EVER ""attack"" me. Instead, they continued to treat me like the doormat/therapist/friend and go out with the more aggressive types.Buy a REAL book like ""Nice Guys and Players"" by Rom Wills",0
"Book full of interesting facts: This was an intresting book but I don't plan on reading it again. Its more facts and interesting details about names, places, and beasts then guess about book 7 plots.",1
"Tried several others..this is the BEST: I was looking for a transmitter to use with my TV, and a pair of stereo bluetooth headphones that I already had. I tried several other transmitters, but they were too complicated and too hard to put into paring mode. This one just works! You simply hold the button down for 7 seconds, and do the same with the headphones, and it works every time. This is important when you're trying to get it to work while watching TV in the dark. Plus, there is zero delay in the audio so the experience of watching TV is excellent. I recommend this unit highly.",1

What has happened to Levi's?: I believe that I have just bought my last pair of Levi's. They have been my favorite jeans brand for years but these are not what they used to be. The fit is awful and I'm not even sure that the denim fabric is the same. I'll admit that I haven't bought a new pair in several years but these seem like an entirely different brand. I plan to start shopping around to find another brand that I will like better. It's sad to say goodbye to such an old frriend.,0
"not as described and very uncomfortable...UGH: This seat is flat and does not feel comfortable to sit on...it is like sitting on a board....BUT the worst is that the ""brushed nickel"" is some kind of junk metal sprayed to look like nickel and the paint is all flaking off.....I should have returned it immediately but thought I could live with it... I would have done but the paint peeling off is the last straw...DO NOT BUY this product.....find a better choice....my thought would be a brand name with brass fittings......",0
"Too much padding: I bought this book looking for a common language for describing web project requirements and design that we could use for project specification and working with partners. I am an experienced Web Project Manager with a lite experience of UML in the past.The book assumes UML knowledge, but the first 150 pages are dedicated to explaining web technology to the reader. Not quite ""The Internet for Dummies"", but hardly critical content?When eventually the author gets into the meat of the Web Extension for UML, it's interesting, but he still spends a lot of time talking about thick-client applications, which really are the exception on public websites. There is one pretty extensive example based on ASP, complete with code. The WAE is useful, but of 300 pages, I found only about 50 useful. A lot of it has already been publisher by the Author on his own website.",0
"I was expecting more: I don't think this is a very good system as everyone says it is, I mean I think the SP is better since the cuality is better and is twice cheaper than th DS. I mean i was waiting for nintendo's new release but when I saw it for the first time it was very dissapoinment (or however you spell it), the systeme looks pretty amazing but its shape and size isn't that cool, SP is way smaller than the DS. The graphics and the picto-chat are one of the things that saved this system. Another bad thing is the realesed games, there's like only 6. Come on nintendo, I hope you do better in your next system.",0

"KILL ... THE MATRIX!!!!: OH MY GOD!!!!This movie sucks so hard, it makes Dude Where Is My Car seem like Lord Of The Rings!!!!!It has a stupid scenario, one that you have,to more or less, get from the start or else you are dead meat and you don't even know it, it's a really bad idea if you wanna just see something and relax, Reeves playing Neo as if he is a robot, and by the first 20 minutes you wish you had rented Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings and not bought this crap, and above all, everything seems to be so important and all keep thinking through the movie is ""What the f**k are they doing there?""The bad news is that they are thinking about a second trilogy (WHY??? WHY????)The good news is that compared to this all other movies are masterpieces!!Well done people, next time you should aim in making a movie that's better than Scooby Doo!!!!",0

"Does not work well with Vista64: Occasionally works with my Vista 64 system / HP LaserJet 4L. After first installing, it worked as expected. But after just about every reboot, the printer fails to work. Sometimes, it will start working if you re-install, but frustratingly, not always. The problem is compounded by having multiple users on the system. It wants to install a printer device (on a new virtual USB port) for each one.So, the upshot is, unless you never reboot your system, this is a big pain to use. It gets 1 star because it did work (and still does, sometimes) and you can't really give a 0 star review here, but really for the frustration it should get 0.",0

"More than Big Time: Words cannot give Rudi's work absolute justice. I can imagine 100,000 other musicians trying to best Rudi and fail. Start with the song 'Number One'. It is a breakout jam and very moving. You can feel a destructive Attitude. I could easily see people listening to this; destroying stuff breaking chairs, windows, and throwing furniture out windows,etc. The song 'BewareWolf' is a real beauty('silver silver bullet')as the song says. it caught me. You may find yourself repeating that track over and over again.'Big Time'is a Super song, and it is probably their most recognized single and with Reason. Most folks have heard that tune'Yummy Yummy' before. 'I Spy'is a great track also. Every song here has something special to offer.",1

"Ick, gloppy cheap lip gloss: I am a lip gloss ""junkie"" & like to try lots of different brands. I have used other Revlon lip glosses before with good results but this one is a real ""stinker"". The colors are weird looking, it's sticky & goopy, & it doesn't stay on longer than maybe a half hour & this is without eating or drinking. I hate it & I have a suspicion it will soon be discontinued. Wet N Wild lip gloss is even MUCH better than this crap.",0
"The Most Inspiring Knitting Book Ever!: I have never before bought a knitting book or magazine which ""spoke to me"" with just about every pattern, tip or idea. I find the patterns to be creative, versitile and up-beat. Melissa Leapman has used a wide variety to yarns, gauges, and styles which can appeal to almost anyone and has offered ""Hot Tips"" for all. I particularly like the way the book has been organized with the table of contents showing a photograph of each sweater along with it's location. I added in the yardage requirements also, so when I went to the yarn store it was easy to match up available yarns with the appropriate pattern. So far I have yarn for eight of the patterns and look forward to making most of the rest. I have found that the patterns I have worked are easy to follow and look great when finished.",1
"Useless: 1st Received - Had a button broken. Did work but right arrow would not click.2nd (Replacement) - Did not transmit the bass.

That one is excellent and I will probably buy me one more of those.",0
"Best WW2 Flight Simulator ever made!: My review of this product may be slightly skewed by the fact that I remember Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe, and played WW2 Fighters for a long time.

"A Fitting Tribute: After reading ""The Guvnor"", and managing to get through it in a matter of days, I wanted to know more about Lenny Mclean, and so bought this tribute compiled by his close friends and family. It didn't teach me a great deal about Lenny's story, but then again that isn't the purpose of this book. The people who contribute include his friends from prison, from his bare knuckle boxing career, fellow actors, and of course his wife and children. It also goes into more detail about his acting career, short as it may have been, and his final battle with cancer, which he ultimately lost, but not without facing it head-on to the end. It gives more of an insight into the man he really was, and it is a fantastic tribute to the man who was, and always will be known as ""The Guvnor.""",1
"How long have all the Five Stars had theirs??: If you're writing a five star review and you've had it for about ten minutes, keep going. I bet a million dollars that in 3 or 4 months or even a bit beyond that it just stops working for no apparent reason. These are not cheap, and I have bought two, one for my daughter and one for my son. My sons (the oldest, bought it first) lasted longer than my daughters at about 6 months, then my daughters did not even make it to the three month mark. Of course, they both fritzed out at the same time otherwise I would not have bought my daughters if my sons had stopped working. I'd much rather have bought a different game consol for them. .Very disappointing.",0
"untrustworthy: The book is full of distorted facts and partial and untruthful analysis. e. g. The author tries to diminish Ilia Chavchavadze's role in Georgian National Identity formation. He writes that during his work as a peace arbitrator and afterwards Chavchvadze's interests turned toward ethnography ""Politically he became more conservative and dedicated himself to his work in the Georgian Nobles' Bank and the society for Spread of Literacy Among Georgians"". Mr. Suny pays no attention to the 12 volumes of Ilia Chavchavafze's articles published in the period of time, material which is the most important in this aspect.",0
"Perfect...Except For One Flaw: This controller is great.It frees you from those messy,tangle-prone wires.The controller is similar to the Japanese Xbox controller (Controller S) except that it is a little wider,and heavier.The Left/Right triggers are a little harder to press,though...I had one problem though.I play Xbox Live a lot,and you probably know that you use a communicator headset,which plugs into the controller.There is no expansion/memory card plug-in on the controller.It's on the wireless reciever,on your Xbox.This controller is perfect for offline play,but...You know.GamerTag:TurboCircuits",1
"Watch Out: I had purchased this same model of the BonJour Frother for our son. That one worked beautifully and still is. Excited to have one in our own kitchen, I ordered another. Much to my dismay, and like many of the other reviews, after two or three uses, the top does not stay on. I can't even get it to stay on with duct tape! We found the unit frothed and mixed quite well for those couple of uses, but it can't do that without the top and batteries.",0

"Predictable but charming story: ""Open House"" is a fun interesting read about a woman who is going through a major change in her life-divorce. I really enjoyed the character of King and the boarder ""Lavender Blue"", as well as a definitely different Thanksgiving celebration! This book makes us believe that things really can be ok and even better after ending a relationship.",1
"Fast paced Western action: This book is a classic good guy vs. bad guy western action book. If you like any of Louis L'Amour's other books, you will love The Shadow Riders. This book is a great example of the qualitites that you can find in most of his books. Most of the characters show a love of family, trust, friendship, a love for nature, and dedication. I would reccomend this book to anyone that wants to read a great book filled with action and suspense.",1
"Doesn't work: It didn't cost much, I realize, but still was expensive for an item that simply didn't work. Idea was to use it in Europe to plug in electrical appliances that are 120. But, no dice.",0
"an enjoyable yet not exactly enthralling read: 'The Man Who Killed Himself"" is a character study about an overly bored middle aged British man, circa 1965, who finds his way out of boredom by adopting an alter ego. Things go well until he overreaches by considering murder as a means to make his life happier. Ultimately he finds himself in a ""spot of bother"". :)This is really a very light read; the author plays it safe, probably too safe. Yet the book is well written; I especially like how the main character is drawn. The mid-1960s English setting is also fun.Bottom line: although a minor entry in the world of mystery novels, 'The Man Who Killed Himself' is a curiously enjoyable read. Recommended.",1
"story not attractive nor convincing: While the most prominent character is the always unreasonable, offensive & bitchy female boss, it's actually a story about the tension between family/friend commitmt & personal life vs career. I don't find the story attractive nor convincing, perhaps in Asia (& particularly HK), ppl have already got used to long working hrs, tight deadlines & demanding business reqts.What really interested me was the privileges enjoyed by the bitchy boss - if she was so unreasonable, why ppl around have to put up with it in the first place? I mean, they could have found another job if they couldn't stand her - so actually it's they have DECIDED to accommodate her. But why? The story said she was really brilliant & talented - so I guess after all, the motto is: one has to excel in his/her field to be a leader.",0
"not good for learning low poly modeling: This book has to many vague descrpitions that will leave the reader referencing every other reading material they own in order to figure out what the authors are talking about. The picture which the authors tell you to reference in the book are small images in black and white, which are impossilbe to make out, I bought this book used and I wanted to return it. These aurthors tell the readers to reference models which are clearly not the original model they started working with as an easy way for the authors to move on, while the reader is left scratch their heads because what they have doesn't match with the authors, Any one learning modeling aviod this book, it will only fustrate you, save your money for something else.",0
"Instant Tarot Reader: I really like this set. Every reading has been very accurate! Some times I find that this deck will not answer the question that I ask... but even though it does this, I still find it extremely helpful because there is something that I really needed to know. I find this deck to be motherly. Meaning if I ignore what it is trying to tell me, its almost like it's saying we cant move on until you deal with this. Now, I am focusing on letting the book go and reading them intuitively.",1
"Perfect with Supermarket Cash Register with Checkout Scanner, Weight Scale, Microphone, Calculator, Play Money and Food Shopping: We bought this for my 5 year old niece for her birthday to go with her cash register. She liked it, but her 2 year old sister gets much more use out of it than anything. Great idea, but more for younger kids!",1
"Expected more from such a talented author: I started this book with high hopes, and the first few chapters seemed truly engrossing, but as the chapters flew by I grew more and more annoyed with the plot -- despite the ""breakneck pace"" there wasn't much of a plot to move along. A few random violent deaths thrown in here and there don't necessarily mean good absorbing action. There are too many incongruities, and the outcome leaves you with a feeling of ""That's it? Come on, there has to be more to this."" Even the subplots seem forced and/or too convenient. If this author has matured enough to rewrite one of his earlier novels to show his maturation as a writer, this seems to be a half-hearted effort. Patterson is capable of a lot more than this.",0
"Better off with the original's: If your looking for the Stray Cats success in Ignition, better off not purchasing this album because '68 Comeback Special Ignition needs an overhaul. My personal feelings is this album lacks the bluesy slide style Setzer had success with the Stray Cats. There are a lot of songs that have the same sounds and those songs that mix it up a bit fall short of toe tappin, hip swayin jive music. Better luck next time Brian. I like his swing success better!",0
"pretty good: Man, I actually kind of liked this movie. Started a little odd with freeze shots and stuff, but once it got going, there was pretty good suspense. Plus Rebecca Neuenswander is really great in this - actually everyone did well. Probably worth renting before buying to make sure.",1
A great gift: I gave this as a gift to an elderly friend who is homebound. He loves it and uses it daily.,1
"Easy Repair Guide: I have a dryer that I bought used 30 years ago. It had started making a noise that sounded like it was tumbling large rocks. With this book and about $40 worth of parts, it's running like new. The book detailed every step. I never could have gotten the dryer apart without it.",1
"An Unhappy Love Story: Why would someone with a voice as sweet and pure as Christiane Noll choose for her debut solo album to showcase the least flattering elements of her usually delightful vocal skill on a collection of songs that for the most part are completely unremarkable? Those familiar with Ms. Noll's enchanting performance in ""Jekyll and Hyde"" know this budding star for her soaring soprano. Rather than accentuating that gift, Ms. Noll resorts to employing a harsh nasal belt that is overly-penetrating, and, in general, annoying. The selection of songs isn't much better. Many of them are from lesser known shows like ""Pipe Dream"" or shows that should be lesser known like ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."" Not one of the tracks ever catches fire, and the passion and excitement that filled her performance in ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is nowhere to be heard on this album.",0
"great dvd, but it doesn't play most of the time!: I also have the unreadable disc problem. The main disc doesn't play consistently, but the 2nd unessential disc works like a charm. I got a replacement copy from the company, but neither of those discs work. It's a bummer because I really like the workout. I actually have abdominal muscles now from using this dvd!",1
Good story line!: This story has so much suspense and good story line. Ms. Horseman is suppose to be one of the bet romantic novelist. I ve only read this novel and not sure I will buy more because pretty expensive on kindle. 9.99 compared to other great talents.,1
Valkyrie Profile: I've heard that this game is alot of fun and I'd really like to play it. The only problem is that Amazon doesn't sell it! What's the deal? Why is this amazing game even on Amazon if they don't carry it?,1

They sounded so professional! Yet, that's what they are supposed to sound like, right? Anyway, I love how young these guys sounded at the time. I highly recommend this CD. KTBSPA!",1
"The most fun game ever made!!: This game is great for one player or great for a giant group of people. No matter how much you play it never loses it's fun or hilarity. Writing this review, I realized I haven't played in a while and I actually miss it it's so great!!",1
"Law students, this is a must!: As a current college student who is intending to go on to law school to study business law, I found this book very helpful. It contains not only what should and should not be in a contract, but also the reasoning behind it.

This book was a great source of information for that project and Im sure it will help later in my eduacation. This is a great book.",1

"Hap-hap-happy to have my hands on some CH Videos: As difficult as Crowded House videos have been to find in the U.S., this DVD is a must for any fan. There aren't any frills, but the material is priceless. Anticipate cackling with glee just to hold this thing in your hand, either because it's going to make your collection that much more fabulous or because you already know how deliciously cheesy the ""Something So Strong"" video is.",1
"Worked for a while: I purchased the Black and Decker Air Station in July 2010. I read many of the reviews and anticipated I could live with some of the issues stated previously by other owners. I specifically wanted an AC inflator and this was a similar unit that I had for about 5 years (Black and Decker also). I received the inflator and it worked well and up to my expectations until about 2 weeks ago, when the inflator stopped working. There were other reviewers also stating premature failure, but thought it was worth a shot. It was a decent inflator but reliability appears to be a real problem when life expectancy is about 5 months.",0
"Couture History: I found this book to be of the utmost interest to people who sew. It offers valuable fashion history and methods used in couture sewing. It catalogs important dates that changed fashion and it offers random pictures of various sewing styles. My only disappointment was that the pictures are limited in number. I would like to have seen more visuals of the methods described and up close details of the ballgowns, in particular. This book makes you realize what an art form sewing can be.It gave me a sense of aesthetic beauty and appreciation for the talent that brings the fabric to life.",1

"This lip balm is not really that much ...: This lip balm is not really that much different from other lip balms. It does go on very nice and it moisturizes well, but the moisture doesn't last any longer than any other balm. It does feel a little better than regular chapstick when you put it on, and it goes on very smoothly. I would buy it again.",1
"Roll On Texas Moon: I especially like Roy Roger's movies when he has Bob Nolan and The Sons Of The Pioneers included in the film. Roy Roger's has always been a role model for young children, clean, honest and his films were decent viewing for the entire family. His kind of clean type image in the movies will be greatly missed. As now most of what Hollywood puts out are R-rated. Is it because our mature Producers and Directors are replaced by Kids?",1
"Just like that special fish - a real keeper!: I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book with the same anticipation as any of Bubba's CD's. I was not disappointed. Maybe it is the fact that I maintain a summer home in the Northern Caribbean (Gulf Shore, AL)or that my daddy flew an albatross as a Coast Guard officer, who knows. All I know is that it is that this book takes me to the beach and the islands whenever I want to go. I was so disappointed to finish it that I was ready to read it again immediately, but I will wait until I go ""Back to the Beach"" next month. Jimmy, see you at the Flora-Bama.Fins Up!

"Takedown, By Matt Christopher: Takedown was about a boy named Sean who gets into a lot of fights. He was good at wrestling and he joined for the first time. He wrestles in three matches and wins the first two; you'll have to read the book to find out whether or not he wins the third match. I liked this book because it was really cool and talked about wrestling and things that relate to my life at school. I urge you to read it.",1
"Interesting but disappointing.: While the first half of the book has some interesting ideas about ancient Egypt, angels etc it quickly devolves into a crazy Christian book of nonsense. Don't bother buying this book. If you want to read it borrow it from someone but don't spend your money. The authors personal beliefs completely overtake anything that could be of interest.",0
"Shark Tale not for kids: We bought this DVD because the ads looked cute, and we were expecting another movie like ""Finding Nemo."" The only thing the movies have in common is great animation. Shark Tale has no threads of morality for kids, and the gangster humor is lost on small children and even disturbingly violent. If it is really designed for adults, so be it, but most adults do not buy animated movies unless they are shopping for their kids. The PG rating should be upgraded to PG-13 or even R.",0
"This movie is a literal Memento. But it's funny, sexy and fun to watch: It's hot, sexy and totally thought provoking all at once. 11:11 is like nothing you've ever seen. Brain candy and eye candy both. It's a cautionary tale for America's self-absorbed pop culture wannabes. It's everything I love and hate about TMZ on film. Beautiful cinematography. Well deserved award for Best Cinematography in a Short Film from the Boston International Film Festival. It has a great concept, interesting soundtrack and great look. It's only 20 minutes long but the DVD has a great easter egg under special features. You can watch the movie as a loop, first backwards and then forwards or just forwards. I would recommend watching it the way the director intended to exercise your right brain.",1
"Icefire: Icefire wasn't my favorite book, but it was good.I like Zanna she was cool, I liked how she changed in the end. First she was a goth but then she changed and became friends with David and started to like dragons.I liked how the author made the dragons come to life.He made it seem real The ending was my favorite, although it was kind of confusing. I want to read the sequel The Fire Within.",1
"Spiderman is great.: Ok, I'm a really big Superman fan first of all. But, I am also a really big ""superhero"" fan. I loooooved this movie. I wasn't sure how Tobey Maguire was going to fill the role, after all, I always saw him as a little kid. Well!! Little kid is all grown up in this flick, and all I can say is ""Woohoo!! Those tights are FANTASTIC!"" LOL I recommend this movie to anyone, it's great for the whole family. Don't miss it!!",1
"So stupid: My wife insisted we watch this piece of ***** . I hated it. Even she thought is was terrible. REALLY, does Mark Whalberg really need the money so bad that he takes a role like this?

"Good Broad base coverage, but that's it: I didn't figure out that this book only covered IE until about midway through. However, the cover of the book has a picture Netscape Navigator on it.This book offers a huge vault of neat little tricks, but I wouldn't want to learn Javascript from it. The examples are right on par, though, for teaching you examples. If you have no other programming experience, you'll probably want to avoid this book, as I felt it was good only if you knew Javascript already and wanted to perform a neat trick or two with the stuff. Most of it involves graphical quirks rather than form processing and such.There are better books around, but this one has its place. If the examples were cross browser compatible, I'd give this book a higher rating.",0

"Great adventure story!: I friend of mine recommended this book and told me it was his favorite book of all time. He also said to make sure you get the unabridged version. (It is over 1400 pages long, but after the first 300-400 pages you will be glad it is so long.) Not only does this book have incredible insight into the human condition, it is also a very exciting tale of escape and revenge as well as a great ""trip"" to Europe. You will be amoung ""bandits"" in the ruins of Rome, high society Europe during Carnival, Parisian society as well as sea faring trips with smugglers through coastal Spain and Italy.",1
"Superb movie debut for Harry: This captures the books charm, excitement and magic perfectly.A wonderful cast and beautiful costumes and sets set the tone for Harry as he discovers he's a wizard and goes of to Hogwarts.A wonderful movie for children and adults alike.Best line ( which wasn't in the book by the way )As Hagrid crashed through the door to first meet Harry.""

After years of reliabiilty...Verbatum flunks: OK. I've been buying Verbatim for years. They've been rock steady reliable and I've never had a problem that wasn't related to something other than the DVD disks themselves.But recently I purchased 150 DVD's in 3 different sets that I am pretty sure are duds.I know because I had about 20 DVD's left from an old batch that ran through my dvd burner perfectly.Only when I opened the new package did I start to get a 50% rejection rate.And I even switched to another DVD burner just to make sure it wasn't a problem with my DVD burner.Same rejection rate...about 50%I know everyone gives Verbatum high marks for reliability...but I have to think that their quality control has gone downVery disappointed.I called the maker of my DVD burner and he suggested trying TAIYO YUDEN brand.I ordered one more set of Verbatum's. If these turn out to be duds...I'm finished with Verbatum,0

"Predictable and uninspired: I bought Nora Roberts' latest book in conjunction with Stella Whitelaw's newest book and a really great emerging author, Lori Davis. I have to admit, although I have been a fan of Roberts in the past, this book (a two for one deal)was a disappointment. The hero is the predictable burly, strong, silent type who must swoop in and rescue the damsel in distress. This theme has been exhausted in all of Roberts' books. Enough already. Time to think outside the box. Readers crave more than the usual recycled tripe.",0
"Read with caution: While this is a large and comprehensive collection of Geisler's work one would have wished he would have been more accurate in his description of Van Til's thinking. As most non-pressupositional apologists, he has many inaccurate representations which is a shame considering that Van Til was the most influential apologist of the century. For a much better study one should read Greg Bahnsen's book.However, there are a lot of articles that will encourage the beliver and give him more confidence in the Truth.",0
"Karas is on Target: Several years back, Kenneth Cooper, the doctor who coined the word ""aerobics"" wrote a book called the Anti Oxidant Solution or something to that effect. In that book, he noted that he had become incresingly concerned about the prevelance of catastrophic illnesses among some elite athletes. He indicated that an alarming number of long distance runners ended up with cancer or heart disease because of the strain it placed on the immune system and heart muscle. I was a runner for years -didn't smoke or overeat. I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in 1995 and which has become quite common among former runners. There's no doubt running and other forms of aerobics get you fit but the damage it does to the body is considerable. Beyond cancer and heart disease there are knee, hip, and foot problems from overuse and repeated pavement pounding.I think you can get all the cardio benefits with weights and no impact actvities such as bike riding.",1

A bit uncomfortable to fit correctly every time you use them...In general I like the sound of these little earphones. They isolate you very good from environmental noise and are very musical for Classic and Jazz music. For Pop and Rock I would wish for a lot more bass. The earbuds are a bit uncomfortable, since it takes some time to fit them correctly every time you use them. Only when adjusted correctly you can really benefit from the sound and isolation. When you are somewhere where you have to take them out frequently, this can be somehow disturbing, but for long time listening it is no problem...",1
"Misleading!: I bought the ""collectors edition"" only to feel completely ripped off! There is nothing new on this DVD! It is essentially the same as the original DVD. The documentary on the making of the movie is the same documentary that is on the old DVD! There are previously unreleased ""still"" images (big deal!) and a new ""Introduction"" that is kinda funny, but overall there is nothing new on this disc. The picture has been ""digitally remastered"", but that is it! There are even fricking previews!!!!! After I bought the DVD, I found out about the ""Achievers edition"" which has multiple discs, etc. I could not find it in any stores. I'm sure that the ""Achievers Edition"" is the ""real"" Collectors Edition. Overall, very misleading! Dissappointing!! Big time!",0
"Almost as good as a vacation: It's so hard to get away these days -- between terrorist alerts and high costs of travel and vacation days being used to visit families, reading a book like The Snack Thief is a like taking a mini-vacation. Camilleri's village is fictitious, but his Inspector Montalbo is true to life. He also likes to read international crime thrillers, savors fine food, and has a laughably volatile temper that can be aroused even if the day is windy. There are episodes in this book that are truly hilarious, some that are horrific, and several that are sad. A good mix. And we're always anxious to see what has been left for his dinner in the refrigerator. Like the Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency series, this series in its entirety presents a portrait of an unforgettable way of life in a specific place with a person I'd like to spend some time with.",1

"Not worth buying: Even though the layout of this book is good with well-detailed instructions and clear charts,the patterns and designs are way too simple and much too basic.

"Very Plausable . . . Very Laughable . . .: I just saw the DVD of this movie last night, and I've been a BIG Jim Carrey fan since his first movie:Ace Ventura.I really enjoyed this movie and found a lot of what was going on to be very plausable. Now I've read a lot of reveiws about the sexual content and after watching it (which I found to be very funny) I found that they left most of it to the viewers imagination.The launguage wasn't overdone, but it did fit into the certain dialogue, and the over all film was fairly well done.Now I was reading one reviewers comments that said that the film was predictable. I'll agree with you on that point, but just seeing the outcome is often quite worth the wait.I laughed right through the entire movie!",1
"what a peace of junk: i just bought this thinking it was the documentory that played on the history channel about the accomplesments and enginering feats of the romans ,neros palace ,ceasars battles,the colosium ect. instead i find this bs naration by montania (they would have been better off with soupy sales at least it would have been funny)mainly talking and explaning about the sexual habits and in a way thats sure to bore and anoy anyone and guess what its almost 4 hours long i hope to get my money back for this if not it will soon find its way to a new home in the garbage can.this lesson cost me this much to learn that thiers a big difference between a master story teller and a wanna bee chump",0
"DO NOT ADOPT SURROGATE CHILD: Having read 'The Need' which is a wonderful book by Andrew Neiderman, I eagerly picked up 'Surrogate Child' in the belief that it, too, would be a worthwhile read. I am sorry to say that it is one of the worst books that I have ever read. The characters are one dimensional and not believable. The plot, while somewhat interesting, never reaches its potential. Poorly written, with a ridiculous ending, the book is not worthy of Mr. Neiderman.",0

"Happy Cats!: All my cats (5) get Frontline, and it really helps Strider, who has a sensitivity to flea bites. It worked quickly, and the price was right. From the smallest (7#) to Strider (22#), a single dose worked without causing irritation.Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens, 6 Doses",1
"Nice cap: This hat arrived quickly and looks pretty much the same as the picture. I wear a 7 1/4 fitted hat size and this has plenty of room. I do like the washed out and wore look also. It is also soft, comfortable, and light. It is a little on the tall side, so it fits like an issued Army cap. As a Desert Storm vet. I don't recall these being issued. I can only remember the boonie hat issued to us, which I still have. So here, 20 sum years later, I finally own a six tone desert patrol cap.",1
"Healthy Feet and Hands: I purchased a container each of O'Keeffee's Healthy Feet and Hand Creme. If you have chapped or open cracks on your heels or fingers, this stuff is for you! I always have a can in my purse and one next to the bed. It is great stuff!! What a difference in my rough and broken heels. O'Keeffee's is worth the price.",1
not a comfy bra: The bra is very uncomfortable. The straps are non stretch and the dig into your shoulders. The cups are too pointy...not a good buy.,0
"good book but where is the proof reader?: In short, I enjoyed ""Lying With the Enemy"". It deserves the high regard offered by the other reviewers.What I find most fascinating is the dozens of gramatical errors in this edition. I have never seen a book with so many mistakes.It really takes away from the book when you have to stop and figure out what the author is trying to convey because a sentence does not make sense.",1
Marketing genius: Whoever came up with this was brilliant. Add 6ml of bleach to a bottle of water and charge people an exorbitant amount of money. I just did the math and made my own. You can do that too and save the environment by using your spray bottle over and over. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the spray bottle is good and a decent spray bottle will cost you a few bucks.,0
"About Harry Potter.: I`m sure anyone would like this book. It`s like you`re in the story as you`re reading it. I would suggest this book to anyone. Harry couldn`t stand living with the Dursleys. (I`m sure it would be a pain for you too). You'll have to read it to find out what the Weasley's are driving around town these days. Strange things are happening at Hogwart's and not a soul knows who did it. Someone is stopping Harry`s birthday letters and Harry thinks his friends don`t care about him. If I would say, It`s a great sequal to Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone. When you`re done with this review go ask your mom or dad or gaurdian to go to the book store and get this book.",1
Little Lord Fauntleroy: I loved this movie. It's a very cute movie with a lot of love and great moral values. It really was fun to watch.,1
"spitter-spatter: Great tasting and hot coffee from this maker in a sleek design. However, the spitter and spatter from leakage can drive you nuts.",0
"Good bag for the price (19.99 when I bought it): I like the bag... the design is unique. Some of the pockets seem really useful, like the mp3 player port, but you will find that you will never use it. Front, back and side protection is adequate, but the botttom could use more protection like some foam pading. The laptop pocket is actually suspended off the bottom of the bottom of the bag so maybe that makes up for it.UPDATE: Now seeing that the price is back up to $45, I would not recommend this bag to anyone. The quality is fine, but $45 dollars will get you a hell of a lot more if you look at other brands.",1
Maravilloso: I saw this movie while studying abroad in Uruguay five years ago and haven't been able to forget it. A story of a simple journey made marvelous by the eyes seeing it and the feet walking it. Worth the price!,1
"Strayed Charm: His third release on the Numa label, Strange Charm pretty much follows in the tradition of The Fury. Relentless drum programs, swirling synths, silky-smooth female backing vocals, and some well-placed brass and lead guitar. But what a departure from the dark and broody Numan we have come to know and love! Highlights here include the opening track, My Breathing, complete with Middle-Eastern mid-section, and the haunting, percussive ballad, This is love. Considering it was conceived in 1986, it still sounds very contemporary - the ultimate test of any artist s work.",1
Speed Sensor Baseball from Markwort: This is a Christmas present and we have not yet had the opportunity to use it.,1
"SUPERB!!!!!!!!!!: These 4 video clips by Jesus Adrian Romero are absolutely a knock-out; musically, lyrically and spiritually; try to find the ""El Aire De Tu Casa"" live concert DVD as well; it'll blow you away; both have the Top Quality that Christian Music in Spanish was needing so bad and Jesus Adrian was very careful to convey that to all of us through his misnistry. He's giving his best to The Lord first and to all of us.Superb....................",1
Splash Dance Mickey Mouse Cassette: I just got this item for my birthday this saturday on audio cassette and i think its one of the best albums disney had in the 80s i do not remember this at birthday partys but ive heard digital duck before and most of the songs on here are pretty good. I highly recomend this album. I give it A++ theirs only one song on that i dont like but mostly its very good.,1
"Don't torture your kids with this.....: I love The Beatles, grew up with them and want the same for my children. Luckily I sampled this online before buying it...glad did not waste the money. Just let your kids listen the their original music. And if you want something a little different, try the I am Sam soundtrack-my daughter loves it.",0
"An Awesome Movie!: This movie is about a boy named Tony (Johnathon Lipnicki) who meets a vampire named Rouldoph (Rollo Weeks). Together they try to break the vampire spell and retrieve the stopne that will do this. This movie has a little bit of everything comedy, action, etc. This movie definetley deserves a Five-Star rating! The actors also acted very well. Especially Johanthon Lipnicki, Richard E. Grant, and Rollo Weeks! I can't wait to see part two of this movie, only if Rollo Weeks and Johnathon Lipnicki play in it! Go and see this movie! In my opinion, it's a Five-Star rating!",1
"Poor Quality: I'm a resident and wanted a cheap otoscope/ophthalmoscope for home use but was disappointed with this product. The focal range is ok for kids but poor for adults. Thus it was hard to get a good focus on the tympanic membrane. Also, compared to Welch Allen models, the light is actually in your field of vision. In my research, a good model costs quite a bit more, so this product is worth it's price.",0
Save your money: Please do not waste your time . The unit was defective from the start. Not easy to use. Return service very hard. After 2 weeks and a freight loss of $27.00 I recieved a credit Do not buy!5 stars on all of my other purchases from Amazon The Dero,0
Research before you buy: I bought one to test at my home. It turned out it did not work for my front door nor my door to the garage. This is because the product does not work with doors with elevated base. So the only place I could use it is for doors between the rooms. But then again I do not really need to insulate one room from another room for energy saving purposes do I?,0
"SISQO'S RETURN OF DRAGON: I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT, I KEPT HEARING SISQO SAY IN DIFFRENT INTERVIEWS, THAT THIS ALBUM WAS TOTALLY DIFFRENT THAN ANYTHING OUT NOW. LIKE WHEN MICHAEL JACKSON CAME OUT WITH THRILLER IN 1982. THIS ALBUM IS NO THRILLER, AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT REALLY STANDS OUT, (LIKE THE BREAK OUT MEGA HIT THONG SONG). THIS ALBUM FEELS RUSHED AND GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC TO FAST. SISQO WANTED TO GET THIS ALBUM OUT FAST BEFORE THE UN STEADY POP FANS OF AMERICA FORGOT ABOUT HIM. STILL IN ALL THERE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS ON HIS SECOND ALBUM. ""CAN I LIVE"" IS DIFFENTLY A HOT ONE, INFATUATED WILL GET YOU OUT YOU CHAIR. THEN THE IS THE THE THONG SONG REMAKE IN ""DANCE WITH ME"" WHICH SHOULD HAVE STAYED LOCKED IN THE DRAGONS LAYER. FOR SISQO FAN'S THIS ALBUM WILL PLEASE THEM, AS FOR SISQO BREAKING NEW GROUND AND REDEFINING THE POP WORLD AND MUSIC AS WHOLE (LIKE MIKE DID WITH THRILLER)BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.",0

"a must read book: This is a must-read book as a Christian. In the middle of reading, this book threw me some moments to think subjects like, why do I live? why did God put me on earth in the first place? what does He want me to do here in earth? Well, answers came very clear to me. I am sure God has plan for me which I've been still looking forward to hear. Whatever He want me to do, all I could do is to try to find something that will please Him in every moment. And I also realized how horrible and sad for people who have never heard of Gospel before during their lifetime and died. I become more careful wih spending money and learn how to use it. Thank God. I believe You lead me into this georgous, attractive and fabulous Your plan. Thank God with all my heart!",1
"You had to be there.: This sounded great to me in 1981. It sounds pretty silly now, though. Maybe it was the booze.",0
"Classic...: This is a classic old school rap album. Probably Willie D at his best, especially when you consider how old this is. If you're a Geto Boys/ Willie D fan , you need this one. Wish I didnt lose track of my original cd, but thats whats great about mp3s. Order this classic for 8 or 9 bucks, and take a trip back in time. I dont think Id recommend buying the cd because it looks like is going for 50-100 dollars. Thats crazy, and I wont pay that much for a cd.",1
"It's NOT Superman: Superman throughout the years has always possessed honesty, intelligence, and the moral center that made him one of the greatest superheroes ever. Comic fans laughingly refer to him as the ""big blue boy scout"" even as they admire his steadfast stand for truth, justice, and the American way. Batman is darker and more complex, but the simplicity of Superman keeps you coming back. There's something we all see in Superman that we wish we saw in yourselves. That said, the Clark Kent/Superman in this book is NOT ANYTHING like that. This Clark Kent is a moron, lacks a moral compass, and has all the appeal of asphalt. Lois Lane comes off like a 1950's good girl gone bad. If you want to experience the real Superman, watch one of the good movies (Superman 1 & 2, and Superman Returns), the animated series, or even ""Smallville"". Listen to ""It's Not Easy To Be Me/Superman"" by Five For Fighting or ""Kryptonite"" by Three Doors Down. But whatever you do, avoid this book like green kryptonite!",0
Great room decoration: These are easy to apply and they look great once they're on the wall. This is a high-quality product.,1
"Frustrating and Disappointing Novel: Poorly written novel which was difficult to finish. The novel was more about the issues of the mother and less about establishing and maintaining a relationship with a daughter that she had not seen in 17 years. It was somewhat impractible to believe that this mother would give up the child she had raised for 8 months without a fight. Second, it was curious that it would take her 17 years to track her down. I did not find that the story maintained a consistent stream of conciousness and the author appeared to jump from one scene to another without intergrating the various themes. I failed to see the significance of some characters, such as Justin and the re-emergence of Jewel. I also found the novel to be incredibly stereotypical of blacks, whites, Jews, southerners etc. The stereotypes were perhaps the biggest disappointment. I would not purchase this book in hardcover. Wait for it in paperback or better yet, get in from the library.",0

"ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!!!: This book was absolutely wonderful!! It depicted how sometimes we as women, and even us STRONG women can get caughtup. We are not perfect. And yes this pastor shares the other half of the blame, but we have to realize that everyone that claims he has been called, has not necessarily been called by God!! In telling her story, she shows us that she finally came to her senses and realized the real deal. Excellent story, can't wait until Volume II. Keep up the good work, A'cire!!",1

"Leadership -- A Practical Approach: Kunich and Lester have written a great book for anyone who wants to reach the top and stay there. Indorsed by Ken Blanchard, Kunich and Lester present an extremely impressive, gripping and focused formula for leadership success. This book is loaded with a balanced blend of leadership philosophy and practical application that inspires and teaches us to become better, more effective leaders. Survival Kit for Leaders masterfully addresses, as few book do today, three key pillars of leadership: character, love, and care for people and professional competence. This book is practical; it makes sense and it works. It is clearly a must read for anyone who aspires to effective leadership",1
"Tried to cancel, but how?: This was a automatic renewal although I don't know why! I tried several ways including phone calls to stop the renewal to no avail. Finally Oprah mag. sent me a nice email of their own and to my surprise there was an option to cancel the renew. Did that, now I will see if it works.",0
"Fashion, Music and Community--Hollywood Style:Wow!: Impressions is simply a great read. Hollywood was essentially ground-zero for Change in the 1970's, and Melanie Onofrio-Haug has captured the best of it with humor, personality and a writing style that has rhythm reminiscent of the times themselves.This is adolescence at its finest. A First Job takes a whole new twist when it is on Sunset Boulevard. Music is more intense when it can be gotten down the street from your highschool. And teen fashion never seemed so fine: ""velvets, satin, Lurex, lame in every color of the rainbow, silver and gold lame jackets, and rhinestones...all teetering atop 7 inch platforms.""This is certainly one of the best books of the summer.",1
"The Movie was excellent: The movie is a great family movie, religious move, and inspirational move. I would recomend it to everyone. It is not to often that one can see a film that does not portray sex, violence and foul language. This film is interesting, informative and passionate. I would recommend it for family viewing, or just for old ladies who need to know there are still some passion in life without violence. Enjoy the spirit of the move.",1
"Horrible Dialogue and aCheesy Plot make this book a disaster: The most glaring and annoying flaw in this book is the wooden, stiff,dialogue. Not only is the dialogue stiff but the actual words the characters use to talk to each other are laughable. The cheesy plot is the other big blow to this novel, not only is the ""aliens from outer space come to take over the earth plot"" absolutely tired and overused but the book abounds with numerous cliches. All in all, simply save your money and don't shell out the money to buy this book.",0
"Best of Rammstein: This is my favorite Rammstein album. They are forceful and somewhat sinister sounding, a plus compared to Mutter and Reise, Reise which, although very good, are more conventional-rock sounding. What really sets this band apart though, is that they sing in German. It somehow sounds cooler in another language, and since I can't understand what they're saying I can really concentrate on the the music itself.",1
wonderful: my favorite perfume smells a little minty and citrus. have had many compliments. would buy it again. so glad I can still get it.,1
"Heat problems: Made for bad DVR enclosure. The external ATA connection is nice, but heat problems kept bouncing the drive making it useless for anything you need 100% uptime for. Provided you can get your files over to it without choking, could make a passable backup drive.",0
"A lightweight comedy that made me laugh out loud: This 2009 film is a lightweight comedy. And sometimes a lightweight comedy is just what the doctor ordered. I smiled throughout and sometimes actually laughed out loud. This film is funny and there's something about it which is easy to relate to.The main character, played by Paul Rudd, is getting married. However, he just doesn't have a male friend to be his best man. And so he starts on a quest to look for a friend. His adventures are hilarious as one guy after another seems wrong. One is gay, one is too old and one is just plain mean. And then he meets Sydney, played by Jason Segal, and the fun really starts. Sydney is an over-the-top caricature of every clich√© you've ever heard about being a guy. This is good for a lot of laughs as the Paul Rudd character learns what it is like to be a ""real"" man. Naturally there is a happy conclusion. And it is very satisfying.Enjoy this film for what it is. I recommend it.",1
THE SONG IS SOULFUL: U ARE ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS AND IN THIS SONG THE TWO OF U SOUND ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. WHEN ARE U COMING TO INDIA,1
"Title remains unchanged: I was heartfully moved by this particular movie. In my opinion Stephen Lang uniquely helped bring these gangs together as one collective group of young teenagers. He taught them survival through circumstances that proved a gem. Although Stephen Lang had demonstrated a certain harsh reality it was without a doubt filled with a warm compassion blended with truth which helped create a newfound group of kids at the end of the day. No longer were they against one another but as one, a team of kids that came to discover something profound about not only themselves. Survival, whether he or she was black, brown or white. Color no longer important, a friendship had been born.",1
"This outstanding science history is superbly written: Melvyn Bragg's On Giants' Shoulders: Great Scientists And Their Discovers From Archimedes To DNA explores the twelve greatest minds in the history of science and ranges from the foundation of hydrostatics in the third Century B.C. to the discovery of the human DNA structure and gene mapping of our present day. This outstanding science history is superbly written, splendidly presented, totally reader friendly, and ideal for both the science history student and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in knowing more about the science and scientists who have made modern life possible.",1
"Entertaining but...: ...not an effective workout. I didn't even break a sweat. Additionally, it's hard to follow because the camera is always focused on her face. If you want a good bellydance workout I would recommend the Bellydance Fitness for Beginners series with Veena and Neena.",0

"Not as described, low quality, barely work: This product is not as described, showed up in plain coardboard box (NOT TUBES), and were very low quality. The are thin, and break occasionally, and the connecters are cheap. The only color that worked was the green, ALL other colors (so ~250 of them) were practically non existant even in the dark. I will never buy this brand or from this seller again. Junk junk junk, waste of my money, and cheapened my experience. I've ordered from a different seller, and a different brand before, and they were GREAT. Stick with a good brand, and not this seller. (US Glow labs, is what I purchased last time).",0
"Nice if you don't mind ironing in a raincoat.: I bought this iron barely 6 months ago and was thrilled with it in the beginning. It does iron very well. The problem is, it has started to leak. Just within the last month or so what started as a slow, small leak, is now leaking so badly the water is running out through the base. I've tried to call Panasonic numerous times and am now convinced there are no humans working there at all. I could never get past the automated runaround. I've just ordered the Maytag cordless and I doubt I'll ever buy anything from Panasonic again.",0
"Ugh........: I found this c.d virtually pointless. The songs are irritating and repetitive, and eventually the ""upbeat"" ones sound exactly the same. Do yourself a favor, and buy the Japanese imports. if your too cheap to buy GOOD music, then at least buy Lunarock, it's the best dubbie c.d out there, because it at least includes two original Japanese songs (Moonlight Destinu and Ai no Senshi)The b.g.m.s on this c.d are nice, but, restating, nothing else is worth listening to.",0
"Alli Weight Loss Aid: I have not had the weight loss that I was expecting. I was only needing to lose 5-7 pounds and had been watching my fat & calories before I started the pills.

"Quality control, anyone?: Although this machine makes terrific coffee if you change the filter regularly, and I like the looks, it began acting up about 6 months after I bought it. Ever since that time, it turns off the heating element at random times, even though it is set to remain on for 2 hours after brewing a pot of coffee. Now I can never be sure to get a hot cup of coffee, which is sort of the whole point behind a coffee maker...",0

"What a Disappointment: For years I've heard so much about how wonderful the Bose Wave Radio is. I finally broke down and bought one, and man, what a disappointment. The sound is crystal clear, true- but it's also tinny and not rich at all. Candidly, the radio on my $40 clock radio sounds better.Why anyone would pay $500 for this is beyond me. Mine's going back to the merchant first thing Monday morning.",0
"Excellent Burner!: This burner was easy to install and use, the swappable face plates also made it a value and easy to add to any computer. Nero software included was a bargain and very user friendly! Top quality, I have always had positive experiences with Sony equipment, I highly recommend it, affordable and easy to use!",1
"70's music: this cd was alright. the music seemed to be something from the early 70's. Something my mom would listen to. I've always liked Patti Labelle, and Nona Hendryx.",1
Outstanding: A compelling story which I was literally not able to put down until I was done. Many examples throughout which are all incredibly useful to every horse lover. I love this book.,1
A Remarkable Story: This is another Hallmark movie that everyone should watch! It is a remarkable story and very well acted. Watch it and learn about an incredible teacher!,1
"Fantastic: This devastating critique of liberalism is as relevant today as it was when Machen published it. Machen demonstrates why liberal Christianity is not really Christianity at all, because even though it utilizes much of the orthodox terminology, it completely reinterprets it! This book is a must read for any Christian, especially those in the mainline church who are struggling with the legacy of liberalism.",1
Good item!: It is a good product. It can hold UMD's as described by the product features. My PSP 3000 isn't really put tightly in place as described by the product features. It can still move a little bit but overall it's still good for protection in case of a drop.,1

"Does what it says: i wanted a book to brush up on some data structures since i've been out of programming for a few months. plus, most of my learning of these has been self taught and from the internet where there is limited (good) writings on more complex subjects such as programming. so i wanted to have a fresh perspective. not only does the book contain very useful details in many areas and to the point information (gets to the first data structure by page 14!) but the author somehow makes this stuff fun to read.the author doesn't go hugely in to depth in some areas but that's pretty much what i wanted since i am already familiar with how to use most of the stuff. very good book and i'd highly recommend it. hope this author continues with more books!",1
"Really useful: I keep this book permanently at hand for prompt consultation and for coffee time inspiration. It is a great source of information for everybody enchanted by the world of beauty, professionals and amateurs, biginners and advanced.I rated just four stars because the trend is changing and the content is slightly out of date. Together with contemporary Robert Jones's Makeup Makovers is a real affair.",1
"Great: This isn't X's best work, but it is still off the hook. The best song is Slippin. The lyrics in that song and every other song he ever made, has some off the best lyrics. X speaks the truth and that's why he is one of the greatest rappers ever to make it big. Good luck in the future X!",1
Excellent: Charges you Sansa without plugging it into the computer. Comes with the USB cable and everything. Just keep your firmware up to date and you're set.,1
Didn't work and lousy tech support: I have a new PC with Vista and this thing kept crashing. I called tech support and got some guy in India that new nothing. Said he would call back and never did. Get an XBOX360 instead - it does all the same things and works smoothly.,0
I was expecting more: Dont get me wrong this is a great game with a great story and battle system. But the game is so linear i could draw a line through it. Whatever happend to explore on your own? Then extreamly bad dialog of yuna and tidus is annoying and corny. The first half of the game is mostly cut seens then fighting after,1

"Good movie - Ringo is pretty cool!: YEah, as I said Ringo has a part which is rare in the movie world. Kind of a silly movie but still watching, and the price was very, very low. Great purchase!",1
"What did I ever do without this thing?: As some others have mentioned, this will not put a sharp crease in your cloths and doesn't provide that really crisp look that an iron and some spray-on starch will but I don't need either of those things 99% of the time. The steamer gets wrinkles and creases out that an iron has no chance of removing, especially in sweaters and delicate/synthetic fabrics. It does spit water occasionally but, so did every iron I've ever used when I had the steam setting cranked up to high. The steamer is fantastic and has sent my iron to closet, most likely for good.",1
"buyer beware: This Tweezer is a fake. It isn't comparable to my several other Tweezermans. It actually doesn't even as work as well as a drugstore tweezer. Also, this tweezer arrived without a box. It came in a single plastic tube and not a regular blue box like Tweezermans come in.",0
"Do NOT purchase a C5180: This HP C5180 is the slowest, noisiest, constantly ""cycling"" piece of-----anyone has ever introduced on the market!

"Not Just a B-Movie it's a B+ Movie: Yes, this is not a major theatrical release, but it does a lot with such a low budget. The FX are very good for the cost of the movie. The acting is excellent. They really tried hard. They call this a comedy, but I found it to be more of a dramady. Not too cheesy... very nicely done. Received my copy the Friday before the official release date. I know I will be watching this DVD again!",1
"Faulty Mount: I got this to replace the pitcher filter we've been using, based on recommendations from others. It worked great for about a month, then it started leaking. The easy click on system requires you to screw on a metal/plastic adapter to your faucet. Why it needs to be easy to remove, I don't know. But due to daily repetitive use, the metal sleeve has started to separate from the plastic and water now sprays out the top making it impossible to use without drenching the kitchen. Don't waste your money.",0

"One of my best purchases: Bought 2 of these for each of my toddler sons before heading to the beach for 2 weeks. They were perfect for the pool! Gave both of them (19 mos & 3 yrs) confidence in the pool. It was the first time swimming for both of them and they were both jumping off of the side into the water the first day! They were easy to get on, adjust, get off, and dry. They were not cumbersome at all and neither of my kids minded having them on at all. My sister bought them for my nieces too and she loved them as well. I would recommend them to anyone!",1

"Sweet and simple: Coming from a 16-hear-old girl like myself, this review may be of little help to some people. But to tell my honest opinion, this movie is a good one. And when I say good, I mean it's good. It's clean, has a fun storyline, GREAT actors, cute moments...and altogether leaves you feeling satisfied. While boys and men may not find much they like about it, I would recommend giving it a try. Little girls, teenagers, and moms alike have all told me they loved it...so why wouldn't you? :)",1
"Awesome mount: we use this mount all the time to move the gps between cars and also to quickly pput it out of view. just used it 8 days on vacation and it works seamlessly, a great buy and better alternative to windshield mount!",1
"Best Jet Li movie yet: Best Jet Li movie Yet, nice cast, very nice fighting scenes, espeically you got to see Jet Li using Sword (away from his usually bare hand comabat)Excellent Video and sound transferHorrible English Translation",1
"Skip the remakes, buy the original: I give this remake 1 star because somehow they seem to repeat the entire movie dialogue word for word, but they squeeze it into 90-ish minutes.Do yourself a favor, if you like Asian Horror and ghost stories, SkIP THIS REMAKE. The original One Missed Call is well worth watching/reading.",0
"Bummer: The cart isn't what I had hoped for. It goes in a straight line just fine, but it doesn't turn corners at all. I have to pick it up and place it in the direction I want it to go. The wheels hook together with cheap materials. I wouldn't buy this one again!",0
"Tricked, oh so tricked!: Good stories, but if you expect anything that has any continuity with the Ring Mythos, look elsewhere. You will be very disappointed.What next, ""tales of the old south- a tribute to tolkien""? Or how about ""a history of jet planes- stories in honor of tolkien""?The stories, as a collection, deserve 4 stars, but this book's title and dust jacket (hardcover ed.) is so misleading that ol' Greenberg gets only one.",0
"Leaking~~~: One box of swiffer is damagaed. Can't return it. Because not only the packing box, but also the receipt got too wet...Other than that, swiffer is swiffer.",0
"A beautiful book!!: I picked up this book while on vacation in Hawaii years ago and have used it while teaching. It's beautifully illustrated with very easy-to-read text throughout. It's appropriate for kids of all ages, but especially the younger ones. It's nice to find a book based on legends that is presented in a way that younger kids will find engaging without losing any of the beauty of the story itself. A book worth buying!! I would also recommend checking out ""Pele and the Rivers of Fire"" by the same author.",1
"THE NEW IMPROVED FORMULA IS HORRIBLE!!: I had been using Alba Botanica very emollient body lotion for close to 25 years and loved it, in fact it was the only body lotion that I wanted to use because it made by skin silky soft, but now that they have IMPROVED the formula it's not as good. I have stopped buying it, and will miss the old wonderful original formula!! The Shea Butter is not an IMPROVEMENT!! It feels pasty now.",0
Condition: I like the book very much but the price of the book was to much for the condition it was in.,0
"Not so common commonsense: Upon reading this book I thought to myself, ""Why couldn't I have discovered this book years ago."" It's chock-full of commonsense, practical techniques for saving money and augmenting your purse. I was shocked when I realized how simple it is to get out of debt, save money, and make your money make money for you no matter how much money you earn. It's simple, smart, and to the point. It's a must read for anyone seeking a cure for a lean purse.",1
"Stick Blender: This is an excellent kitchen tool. Easy to use, a snap to clean amd no problem storing it away. As usual, Amazon service was first rate!",1
Best music DVD I ever saw.: Can you give something 6 stars? Just absolutely the best music DVD I ever saw.,1
"one of my favorite books to read...: Almost Paradise has been one of my favorite books to read over and over again for the past 15 years. It's THAT good. :#The characters are amazing. I love Nick and Jane. :) It's got laugh out loud humor, happiness, and heartbreak. You will laugh, you will cry... I always pictured Brad Pitt as Nick and Robert Redford as his father. #if they were to ever make this book a movie)This book grabs you right from the first page and keeps you hanging to the very last page. (it keeps you wanting more) I recommend this book. I have both a hard copy and a soft copy. (my soft copy is now tattered). Buy it... read it... you won't regret it.",1
"The End is Near!: The End is Near! reveals a strong spiritual kingship between these brilliant minds of today and major luminaries of the past like Hieronymus Bosch, William Blake and Emmanuel Swedenborg. It hints at shared understanding between self-taught contemporary visionaries and such ancient prophetic traditions found in Classical Greece, Aboriginal Australia and the seers of the Holy Scriptures. Included in The End is Near! is the entire Revelation of St. John the Divine, perhaps the most influential and widely-referenced- yet rarely read -work on the ultimate fate of humanity and the universe. The End is Near! should become compulsory reading for anyone intrigued by the mysteries, depths, and triumphs of the human spirit.",1
"Decent massager, but not for the price.: I've purchased other products from Interactive Health, including the iJoy (which is AMAZING compared to other massage chairs I've tried), and their Ottoman 2.0 (which hits the spot on the calves wonderfully).I bought this in hopes to get the same quality and effect as I have from their other products, but have been disappointed. The two massaging handles on either side of the pillow massage the sides of my neck well, but doesn't hit the back of my neck at all--and that's where my sore spot always tends to be at! The ""pillow"" itself is hard and can be uncomfortable, so you have to position your head carefully in order to really relax.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager at its expensive price. However, should you find this massager on sale, it's a decent product. I'm still in the pursuit of a more effective neck massager, though...",0
Tennessee reader: Very disappointing. Way to technical for my taste. The writer surely did his research on techno babble but the story left me wanting .....,0
"When Will Byrne Get His Due?: I agree with the bulk of previous reviewers' positive comments about this movie; I couldn't really add much that hasn't already been said. However, it's a shame that, as far as I can tell, Gabriel Byrne wasn't nominated for any acting awards for his role here. In fact, at least in the IMDB listings, the only role he's EVER been nominated for (which he won) is some TV appearance in the 70's. This guy's a great actor who's been in a number of excellent films. His style is completely unaffected, never a distraction, and a pleasure to watch, MILLER'S CROSSING certainly being no exception. Would you have wanted anyone else to play Keaton in USUAL SUSPECTS? Come on...give this guy an award!",1
Complete Junk: My 3 year old son is a cars fanatic. I thought he would love to play this with me. He loves perfection. But this toy is complete junk. The parts don't snap in and only two of the wheels come off. And they just fall off sadly. It is total and complete junk. There is not a single redeeming quality behind this toy. Don't waste your money. Mattel and Disney should be ashamed for marketing this.,0
this is why I only buy from bandai japan: its good as a toy but not on display. fun for little kids but not good for collectors good leg movement for a megazord.,0
"Excellent: I bought this book in combination with the kaplan book, and this book seems great. The english section seems much better in this version because it tells you types of errors you will see along with what you need to know (and what you don't need to know). The answer explanations are pretty in-depth, which is what I enjoy the most.",1
piece of junk.: It's great it only cost $5 and some change but I used it twice and the piece that connects to your iPod just fell off. Waste of time and money.,0

"Northwestern bell 36070: This was a gift, but the recipient was very pleased with the product. The product was delivered in a timely manner.",1
"No Luck: I haven't received it yet and have been trying to email Amazon with no luck, It was sent on 3rd Dec to AustraliaThey promised to deliver by the 22 Dec if I bought before 4th Dec so I don't think I will ever buy a book from Amazon again. No book no review",0
"A great book for the Novice Planner: I am looking to establish my own financial planning firm, so I searched for material to read so that the process would be easier. Rattiner authored another book that I read so I was familiar with his energy and commitment to the profession. ""Getting Started as a Financial Planner"" was a good book. I will recommend it to my CFP classmates at NYU.",1
"Tries, but terribly misguided: I was a bit dismayed with Hook's book because in reality it just reiterates the cliche'd notions we all have about gender and gender relationships. Bell attempts to influence readers to adopt miandrists beliefs, albeit she does so subtly. Males do have emotions although perhaps we often don't see that, and Hook's insensitivity to the male gender is subtle, but still ubiquidous throughout the book. I cannot reccomend this book because like many modern works that attempt to persuade readers to ""follow the inner self"" this work actually harbors hate",0
Works great!: It's incredible how cheap this product is and how well it works. The only problem is that if you buy this item alone you will end up paying more for shipping than what it actually costs.,1
"Hopelessly suburban middle class: Shales analysis of our tax code is typical of the recent right wing calls for tax revolution. ""The Greedy Hand"" will likely be sucked up by many white middle-class suburbanites who have lost touch with all that they receive back from government. It is ironic that those who most benefit from our tax dollars--the middle class--are those who most complain about their tax dollars being wasted.Shales' proposals are just as typically hopeless. An elimination of progessive taxes sounds fair and just until you realize it means that those who cause most of the unjustice in this world--wealthy American technocrats--will make out like bandits.",0

"Travelling in South Africa: An easy to read book about the author's travels in South Africa. His journey begins in Cape Town and his route takes him up and through the Western Cape to the Northern Cape and across to Johannesburg, to Durban, Port Elizabeth and back to where he began his journey in Cape Town, visiting many interesting and familiar named places on the way. Never boring, and delightful glimpses of a way of life sometimes very different from that perceived here in the U.K.",1
"Authentic and Soothing: Great stuff. All printed in Italian, and if you close your eyes it smells like your in the biggest rose garden in the world.",1
"Poor video and sound quality: I like Cinderella. I watched them live in concert three years ago and the band still sounded great. However, this DVD has poor sound and video quality. I believe the band performed and sounded better in the Make a Difference Foundation concert in Moscow even though it was recorded in VHS. I am rating this DVD with two stars, because of the mediocre sound and video quality.",0
skippy nailer: No luck at all with this crown stapler.The stapler skips every other time.Not recomended .,0
Incredible Movie: This could have only come out of the mind of Michael Crichton. The movie is one of the best sci-fi films that I have ever seen. The possibility of going to a place where robots look human and are there to satisfy your every need is a thrilling concept even today. This movie has a stellar cast with Richard Benjamin and James Brolin turning in stellar performances. The best part of it all though is the chilling portrayal of the gunslinger by Yul Brenner. Just to see him playing this role makes owning this movie worth it. A must movie for fans of great imaginative filmmaking.,1
"Simply Awful...: All fluff and no substance. If you read the book, there is one thing I can guarantee. After two days you won't remember one word of it, nor will it make any difference to your business.",0
Dreadful: I was very much looking forward to playing this game but it never worked! I had several people try and find the problem but all gave up and said it was impossible to make it play faster. I have a very new system so I don't think it was that. Maybe I just got a bad one but it certainly wasn't worth the money! It's now collecting dust.,0
"But it's NOT a comedy !?!?!?: I was enjoying this and laughing lots. Hysterically funny spoof. Then I realized it was not intended as a spoof, which made it even funnier.This movie is so dreadfully bad it's great! From the opening ""Hhhaaaiiiirrrryyyy"" I knew I was in for a rare treat. And the movie does not disappoint, as long as you don't take it seriously at all. There's nothing in this flick to make it even a moderately good action/adventure or suspense flick. Nothing even remotely Hitchcockian to it. But I couldn't stop laughing! Just kept getting funnier and funnier -- worse and worse! I love it.",0
My Goodness - What Happened?: I searched George Duke because he was on the piano for Jean Luc Ponty's Live at Donte's Hollywood session in 1969. What an awesome bop stylist! But what did I find? Schmaltzy pop. Go back in time for this guy's best stuff.,0
"Complete Poop: You need a ZERO star rating for this heap. It's total TRASH. It's a camcorder homemade piece of stank. I couldn't even watch the entire thing, I had to FF through with my DVD remote. I was so disappointed. Oh, and don't think for a second you're getting T & A or a girl that looks anywhere near the one on the DVD cover, cuz YOU'RE NOT!! I'm glad I picked this up for 3.00 from my local store in the clearance. Even so, I wish I'd spent the 3.00 on some candy. JUNK!",0
"The ""Politically-Correct"" Secret: I truly enjoyed a good portion of this book. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what the Third Secret was. But, I was so disappointed. The secret revealed by the Virgin turns out to be liberal, politically-correct nonsense. I could barely finish the book.",0
"Uninspiring: If you were expecting this to be similar to the quality and content of the DS9 companion then you'll be greatly disappointed.Each episode is listed followed by 1 or 2 pages of what I call ""stating the obvious."" There is no analysis, no background information no discussion as to what worked and what didn't.I love Voyager dearly and really wanted to like this book. Do yourselves a favor and do not buy it. It gives you absolutely no insight into each episode at all.",0
"More than your typical kick-punch manual.: Dean Clerc's ""The Mindset of a Martial Artist"" is an essential asset for the serious martial arts practitioner. This guide takes the reader from the usual method of learning by rote (Rote: ""a memorizing process using repetition without full comprehension"" and/or ""the mechanical routine marked by unthinking repetition"" as defined by Sensei Clerc) and encourages the student to research the martial arts, to analyze what techniques work against different opponents and why. Subjects such as ""Reading"" the opponent, ""Timing the strike"", and so forth, are insightful strategies that are usually learned through the school of hard knocks, however Mr.Clerc offers them to you in this thought provoking handbook. As a practitioner of the martial arts for twenty-five plus years, I feel that Dean has provided the reader with valuable information that works in the training hall, and in the streets as well.",1
"This is not the best example of crosstitch books available.: slsdaniel1@aol.com from Dallas, Texas, 07/12/98 This is not the best example of crosstitch books available. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book as it pales alongside most others currently available. The execution of the charts is not particularly expert and the subject matter is often trite. Even though blue and white is my favorite color scheme, I could find nothing in this book that merited hours of toil with the needle and thread. Perhaps you might disagree with me, but do not buy this book sight unseen.",0
"Great Collection!: Herb Alpert is an excellent trumpeter as this album along with volume 2 indicates. It contains key tracks from his 1960s albums, but obviously this is NOT a complete portrait of his music career. The major flaw with this collection along with volume 2 is the overall sound quality. This may be a hard collection to find online or in music stores. You are better off getting the ""Definitive Hits"" since the sound quality is much better.",1
"Lack of detail: I am surprised that a lot of people thought Red Rabbit was boring. Boring yes, when it comes to action but in quality and detail, perfect. Teeth of the Tiger was way to short, cheap and lack of detail. The action was great but just not enough detail. I ve read only three of Clancys books and this was the weakest of them. Definitely not one of Clancys best.",0
"This book does more harm then good.: The book is full of grammatical errors. The copy I received was marked up in pen with the first correction on page 4. Some of the questions are so garbled as to be completely incomprehensible.For example Question 304:""Which THREE of the following process shall be included in treatment system for SS Credit 8, Light Pollution Reduction credit?""Studying for this exam is not easy and this book makes it more difficult. There are no explanations for the answers. Given all the typos and grammatical errors in the body of the main text, I am hesitant to trust the answer key.[...]Shawn Shahfar has wasted my time. At least I can get the money back from Amazon.",0
"Don't Buy This Book: I just finished this book and not sure if I learned anything that wasn't already in the SDK documentation. I understand that writing a book would be hard, but it seems that they almost copied the information. There is another VB book that deals with DirectX by Crooks [...] that is very good as it helps you to build a complete game including all the 3D models, sound effects and other misc. items. You should buy that book instead -- Just MHO!!!![....]",0
"not a great book: You know, although I keep complaining about her books being written to a formula, I don't like this one, although it is slightly different in that the heroine doesn't live happily ever after. Such a plucky thing she is. Is the author punishing her for being too greedy and having ambition? Oh well, I'm not going to go mad and demand the hours I spent reading it back anyway.",0
Loud and does not cool well.: Even living somewhere where it is very low humidity (usually less than 10%) it does not cool enough to make it worth the noise. The noise actually kept me up at night. Get a normal fan instead - it will work better in the long run.,0
"A disappointment. The book is very 'padded'.: I'm currently reading the book ""Internationalization and Localization Using Microsoft .NET"". The topic of this book is one which I'm very interested in. Unfortunately, this book has been very disappointing to me.When read a book on a targeted technical subject, I like to read something which is concise and to the point. Preferably with many useful examples in the text.This book fails on both points.The author often wanders off topic in a very conversational tone and there is an entire chapter on Visual Basic 6, which is not .NET. This would be fine if I was reading a book on a general topic which benefits from anecdotes and humor. But this topic is one where I want to get to the ""meat"" of things and move on. I think with a good editor, this book could be reduced by 100 pages!I've also found the example code to be trival implementations of the subject, with almost nothing which could be re-used in a professional environment.",0
"Don't waste your money: The recorder/pen looks nice but doesn't work very well. I could never get mine to turn on without taking it apart, jiggling the batteries and then trying to turn it on again. Your money is better spent on a non-China made product.",0
"Where can I find those pants?: I love the premise of the book, I think that the plot gives the author license to take the story wherever she wants. Its great how each best friend has their own story within the story - I got a little confused sometimes, though.I could relate to all of the girl's stories - Bridget really changed from the first one, and sometimes I wanted to hit Tibby for being so ignorant. But they are ""human"", right? It's a fantastic book and everyone should read it!",1
"Conair SU7 Sound therapy and relaxation clock radio: This product is not as good as i thought. I have been dissappointed in the amount of static that comes from the product, when turned on.

"Awesome wind machine ...: Simply put, these are some of the best and most durable fans that are on the market. As owner of two of them, the wind never stops blowing ;-)",1
"The Movie WAS WAY Better. The book...disapointment!: This story lacked passion. The ball was dropped big time and was very disappointed. The movie is based off this story, but the movie writer made many changes that were not in the book... I think for good reason. Watch the movie and pass on the book.",0
"Administering IIS 4.0: This book has everything you need in it to not only pass the IIS 4.0 test, but the necessary information to administer IIS 4.0 in the real world, which is extremely hard to find.",1
"Works Fine: I needed this size for cards and hard drives. They work fine. Note that they do not have any kind of zip lock seal, you just have to tape them. They would be better if they had a reusable seal",1
"troyez: Ever since I first heard ""Blind Man in the Dark,"" on the radio in 1998 I knew this Mule thing would be great. I knew Warren and Woody from the Allman Brothers and knew they were great, but when they stepped out with Gov't Mule it was like a breath of fresh air for me. This album was the first Mule album I bought (and wore out) and it rocked my musical foundations. It is a must buy in my opinoin. I have seen Mule three times now, met them once (before Woody died), and would kill to see them again - my point is that this album changed the musical landscape for me. Go and see the Mule live (if you haven't yet) and support the boys in person.",1
missing the stoppers: Finally got it in the mail and the kit is missing the stoppers. The kit is sealed but somehow both of the stoppers are missing. Don't buy this one. Amazon will not simply send you another. You must return the item for a refund... hassle!,0
Great gift idea!: Gave one to my Dad for his birthday and he lovesit. I tried it once and it worked fine. One smalldrawback is that the lather could have been just abit hotter for my taste but in general this is afine product that does what it's supposed to do.,1
"Good historical fiction: Wasn't sure what this book was about when I downloaded on Kindle, but I enjoy good historical fiction and this fit the bill. Based on what I've seen, the book is accurate (as you can be for a novel about the 1300's), but the author adds the details that bring the history alive.",1
"Great Product: We got these because we had a 5 week old baby at the time, and needed to get up every few hours during the night. We didn't want to turn on lights because we wanted to keep the baby as sleepy as possible. These lights let off enough light to see what you are doing without being obnoxiously bright. You can rotate the light to shine up, to the side, or down, so that it's not shining in your face. They are also great because they automatically turn off during the day when you don't need them, and they turn back on at dusk, saving energy. A very useful product and we have them all over the house now.",1
"A MUST READ: I have read few dozens of books related to Persian Gulf War 1991. The book is rated the best hardcore book full of precious military experience and insight. If you want to know about what really happened to XVIII airborne corps in 1990-1991, it is a must read.",1
"Aquamarine: ""There's something fishy about her...""Aquamarine stars Emma Roberts (Scream 4), Sara Paxton (Last House on the Left), and JoJo (RV). I actually loved this movie, it was really funny and a very good movie. The special effects are very cheesy, but that's what happens in these kinds of movies right?Clarie and Hailey are the best of friends, but Hailey is forced to move to Australia when her mom gets her dream job out there. Claire and Hailey pray for a miracle to happen, then they meet a magical mermaid that can grate the one wish if they help find love.This movie was seriously good, it was funny and just flat-out fun. It's actually a very good PG teen movie, the only other teen movie I've liked that was rated PG was Sleepover.[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED]",1
"It needs less then one star: I believe after The Exorcist 2, The Exorcist series just stedily went down hill. Pt 3 lost its fear factor; The Beginning lost its fear factor and lacked good effects; Dominion had no fear factor at all, the effects sucked, the plotline was not original and it was boaring, the acting was poor, and the movie was about an hour too long. If you want to see movies with great possession scenes check out The first two Exorcist movies, Stigmata, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, or American Haunting. Don't watch this even if it comes on the tv, you'll be waisting your time.",0
"Disappointing and disorganized: I bought this book hoping to finally have a complete Javascript reference. You know, the kind that lists the objects, then their properties and has a good index. At first glance this book appears to fill the bill, but after using it for some time I find myself going back to Goodman's ""Javascript Bible"". There is something half-baked in the organization of this book that makes it hard to find anything when I'm looking for it. In short, this is not the definitive guide, but merely one of several books you'll need on hand to program in Javascript. *Sigh*",0
"This is one of the most revolutionary albums ever.: David Bowie invetned glitter rock. It is a masterful style. This album contains the hit ""Ziggy Stardust,"" about a plastic rock star's descent from glory. I also liked ""Suffragette City"" and ""John, I'm Only Dancing.""",1
"Can't get replacement DI cartridge!: This was a great product...until they discontinued the supplies. Amazon's still selling the soap but the DI cartridges can ONLY be had by buying a starter kit...which, of course, is ridiculous!",0
"Too slippery to stack properly: I really like the idea of the big cardboard blocks. I remember them from my youth having a matte finish, and was disappointed that this set has a very slippery shiny surface. This means that they slide a great deal and are hard for younger kids to stack.",0
"Needed an Editors Touch: This was a slow read from the beginning. The plot was dull not what I'm used to from this author. It picked up towards the end and at the same time dragged on. I was surprised to find how many inconsistencies this book had. For example, the wrong character names were being used. It looks like an editor never went over this book looking for errors.",0
"Cornwell's winning style comes through again!: I always hate it when the book ends! Scarpetta finds herself in an unusual situation once again, and manages to keep your attention right up to the last pages. Keep up the good work and keep those novels coming!",1
Adequate: It isn't as loud and powerful as the other reviews made it out to be but for a cheap fan it does the job.,1
"One star is far too much: I have a collection of about l000 movies on dvd. There are excellent movies among them, others are average and still others are poor and boring. ""Breed"" is just bad, bad, bad... Dogs (more cute than frightening) play with shouting and screaming ""acors"", following a ""story"", which never gets exciting. It takes courage, to watch this movie: not because of the horror, but because of its below zero qualities and boring stupidity. I have a collection of about 1000 movies. ""Breed"" won't make it into my collection. Watching it was a complete waste of time.",0
"Great fit, couldn't be easier to install!: The auto ventshade 92305 ventivisor deflector is an incredible product. Fit my Dodge 2002 Caravan very well. So easy to install, too! Highly recommend this product.",1
"repeat, repeat, repeat: This book was a disappointment because the puzzles are the same ones that were in the last 500 Sunday Times puzzle book I purchased. Good, perhaps, for people with dimentia.",0
"Perfect album: One of the great, great albums. Anderson and Butler were untouchable.Seeing them live when they were touring with this album was something you had to see to believe. They were jaw-dropping. I paid lots of money to have my guitar teacher help me learn how to play the songs on this album, and every penny was well spent. I will never tire of hearing this album. If you aren't knocked out by Bernard's hook on Animal Nitrate the very first time you hear it, well, I'm sorry for you.",1
"Offensive!: The author tries so hard to relate to fellow Gen Xers that he ends up littering the book with cynacism and offensive phrases. For example, he explains that ""Black Monday"" refers to the day the stock market crashed, not the TV entertainment lineup. And, that's just where it starts. Buy another book, even if the author is over 24.",0
"Good Bag: Well Constructed. Good Value. Bought for a 3 year old fits perfect, should last another year or two. Enough pockets and space.",1
"Great Sampler: This is a really nice colletion for the World Fusion fan. High quality sound, nice blend, and reasonably priced. (They certainly could get more dollars for this CD). This is one that you can listen to multiple times without getting tired of it.",1
One of the Best: Great rockin' Christian cd. Every song is awesome! Buy this one. You will not regret it.,1
"Camera works fine, but drivers/software are making me nuts: I installed the camera, and it works fine and has a good picture. My biggest gripe is with the software that came with the camera. If you install the camera webcenter software, it will launch repeatedly on its own and start filming and snapping photos automatically. If you uninstall the software and leave the drivers installed, you keep getting an error message from the windows image acquisition software. To get rid of this, you have to uninstall the drivers, which disables the camera. I'm not sure if my problems are typical, but I find them highly annoying. In this day of privacy concerns, I would have expected Creative not to introduce something that behaves so suspiciously.",0
"<< Beautiful epic >>: This novel depicts the life of a Chinese migrant who escaped the utter poverty of rural China for greener pastures in Thailand. Tan Suang U's story is told as a compilation of letters he wrote to his mom in China in a period of 20 years from his arrival in Bangkok in 1945.A typical tale of rags to riches.Typical of many ""ugly Chinamen"", Tan's observations and criticisms of Thai culture are candid and unrefined but also refreshingly honest. Proud of his culture which emphasis honest hard work and frugality, he is destined to be disappointed as within just one generation, his family's cultural identity is lost.Botans writing style is fluent, brilliant, vivid and full of color. This book won the Siatu literature prize in 1970 and it is one of very few novels that were translated from Thai.I know it is out of print for a long time but it is worth waiting and looking for.",1
The actual contents of Humor: More News from Lake Wobegon: I bought HUMOR; More News From Lake Wobegon in 2011 from Amazon. Was very disappointed that only four of the sixteen essays are on the CD. Nowhere in the description of the contents does the producers let the buyer know which essays are included on the CD. That is why I give this CD only one star.They are: Pontoon Boat / Author/ The Freedom of the Press / VicksThe total run time is 70 minutes.,0
Audiovox Sirius FM direct adapter: I have a Sirius radio and the fm modulator was not powerful enough to overcome the capture effect with nearby broadcast stations. So I researched my radio and found the cable connections were exclusive to subaru (2005) but found the necessary adapters and ordered two adapters and this Audiovox unit. Installation was straight forward the most tedious part was getting to the radio. After getting to that point and installing it. I found the broadcast interference is gone and also the white noise. Happy customer here both with amazon and audiovox.. Id recommend the unit if you dont have an aux in for audio on your stereo which I didnt. BTW there is a good pdf file on the web that covers removing the subaru outback radio which took a while. To save you time do some reseach on your radio and check if the standard connection to your radio is motorola or not. If not you will have to by adapters or make them yourself.,1
"Good but not the best: Very good, but I didn't like it as much as Excission and The Player of Games. I like a tight book and Phlebas had a great opening and a great close, but it slowed down a bit in the middle. Interesting to have an anti-culture main character.",1
Lost interest: I got thru less than half of the book. Too much Scottish dialog. Hard to follow story. Had to keep stopping to figure out what author is trying to say. I probably will not finish this book.,0
Da Game!: This is by far the best b-ball game I have ever played. The graphics are the best I've seen for any sports game. The moves and the features are cool.,1
"Good fun: UNO is a classic game that is still fun to this day, however after only a month of use and light shuffling I have noticed the cards are made extremely cheap and start to break off on the edges. This is nothing near the quality of a normal deck of playing cards.",1
"Great phone at a great price: The phone feels lightweight, but solid. I have previously had a Nokia and a Sony-Erickson, which did the basics, but this phone has a lot of nice features. The slider feature is very nice and helps prevent keys from being pushed without the need to lock them. The camera does 1280 x 1024 pictures (1.3 megapixel) which is more than enough for a photo printer doing 5 x 7s. It also does video (at 15 frames per second which is 1/2 of regular video). The mp3 player is simple enough, works with the phone closed and can read from either the built in memory or a micro-SD card which can be inserted in the side. The only downside to the music player is that the audio files are limited to 128 kbps (which sounds fine) and the file names need to be no longer than 32 characters. Given the choice, I would certainly buy this phone again (especially since it was free with a [...]mail-in rebate).",1
"Excellent Sample of Cello Masterworks: This is a fine, exquisitely performed sampler of superb cello pieces from the Baroque to the Romantics. The French soloists play the pieces with taste and aplomb; a very pleasant CD to hear.",1
"good knife but heavy: this is a great knife but it is heavy compared to my victorinox 10"" knife almost 3 ounces heavier and it does cause wrist fatigue after several hours of daily use. the knife is very comfortable in my hand with a great edge i only have to sharpen it every 3 days but for heavy prep work I would buy a lighter knife",1
"Great for Dancers: I love Tracy Anderson Method Dance. I have no dance background, so its hard to learn the choreography. The work out is amazing. Its definately a keeper and will keep me busy learning for a long time. I need alot more room to do the workout. My living room is not large enough.",1
"Good stuff: Just in response to the above, there is a set of similar arrangements of the other major operas by the Linos Ensemble. It is on Amazon.",1
"Instant Death: After about a year this (for me) expensive phone died. I liked the speaker phone function, and I'll miss it. I've returned to my old, reliable, free (yes, I got it for free) AT&T phone. Sometimes in life, a step back is actually a step forward.",0
"TCM-929 Pressman Desktop Cassette Recorder: In General the product is good for a good price,but because of the small batteries it uses,the listening time is shorter.",1
worked.. then snapper: This Bit worked for the first hole I drilled. Then snapped in half for the next. The Quality Import bit really lived up to its Quality import name.,0
Awful!: Awful sequel (...) in where the Critters are transported to the future (looking at the montage from Critters 3) and make it on to a spaceship viciously attacking the crew once again. A final showdown ensues between the critters and the humans. But is it that final???Rubbish sequel,0
"ENLIGHTENING TALE: The book itself arrived within 2 days. It is a used book and slightly worn just to where I like to see a book that has been read more than once~ The story is based on a true person, his journey accepting news of his pending death from Tuberculosis, and his intrinsic connection with fate, God and the Universe. His journey carries him beyond the disease to years in remission and his eventual death in the hands of those who questioned him. I love this book and can read pieces of it anytime I question my own fate and journey~",1
"NUTHANG ORIGINAL, RECYCLED: IF THIS WAS THE 90'S IT WOULD BE AWRIGHT, BUT IT'S NOT!! PLEEASSSE SUMTHANG ORIGINAL",0
"Bad spoof: Spoofs of this kind is sometimes nice. This one is not. Corny and very low-budget. A better spoof of Gladiator is the one by Private. It's really high-budget (relative to other features in it's genre), really good looking women. See that one instead.",0
"Does everything is says it can: We picked this up the other day and it is fantastic. It really can use pods, bagged tea, and loose tea or coffee and can handle them all perfectly! It can make up to 14 ounces at a time and has an adjustable shelf to hold a coffee mug or travel mug. Ours will be getting a lot of use in the future.",1
"Awful taste, but works!: I started taking Maca in capsule form months ago for a libido increase and bought this pouch so I could take higher doses cheaper than I could in capsule form. I figured a little did me good, a lot will do a whole lot more. I take about 2 tsp morning and night, and while I am happy with the libido boost, I don't feel the energy boost from the product (yet).The stuff is the second worst tasting stuff I have ever taken for my health. I can find nothing to help it down but OJ. On occasion, it tastes so bad that I hurl most of it back up. Lastly, the 16-ounce pouch is of good quality and reseals dozens of times very well.",1
"Neill's Brilliant!!! 5 stars!: I saw this originally on PBS years ago, absolutely brilliant! This and ""My Brilliant Career"", are what REALLY hooked me on Sam Neill. The guy is amazing, locations wonderful and rest of cast remarkably gifted as well. One of the best, if not the best, series ever aired on PBS and any other channel, bar none. A real bonus if you're a history buff. Reilly was just a fascinating character....",1
"Shaara does it again: Jeff Shaara has yet to disappoint. As in his other novels, Shaara brings history to life through the eyes of those who were there. 'To the Last Man' is an engrossing and enjoyable page turning novel of World War I. History was never more fun.",1
Sogno Di Cantante: Rosemary's interpretation of the great operatic works are to be commendable. The musical director and pianist help to support Rosemary's wonderful voice....A wonderful career awaits this talented singer....Keep up the good work,1
"Works fine once you get the hang of it: The first time I used it, the butter fell out. The next time, I tried lifting the lid out of the water at an angle, to break the suction before the butter had a chance to fall out, and it's worked ever since. I also make sure to spread the butter right up to the edge of the lid, for maximum adhesion, and then I use the butter from the center out.I guess my only problem with it is the paint doesn't go all the way up... there's a white ring at the top of the lid. I'd like it to be completely black.Also, my husband bought the matte one, which makes annoying noises when the knife is scraped against the side. But I don't know if the butter would stay in with the gloss finish.I'd like to give this 4.5 stars, but I guess 4 will have to do.",1
Hartz UltraGuard Rid Flea & Tick Shampoo for Dogs with Oatmeal 18oz: Not enough lather to soap up my dog whole body with out using half the bottle. It make the bath a very long process the get the dog fully washed,0
"Insightful analogy drawn between ecosystems and businesses: Drawing an analogy between the ecosystem and the business environment, the author provides an insight into how businesses should cope with the ever evolving and changing business environments. The text cites examples of how successful companies define or help shape their ""ecosystems"" and subsequently gain competitive advantage",1
"Didn't get what I ordered!: I was happy to find a red watering nozzle so I ordered 2 of them. I also have a red garden hose and other red accessories. When I opened the box, it contained a purple one and a green one! I contacted them for a return request and after 2 emails, they still didn't give me one, but wanted to give me a partial credit instead, which is not what their return policy states. I finally gave in because I figured summer would be over before I actually received a red one. Then they told me there isn't even a choice of colors!! So why then do they offer a choice of colors in their listing, I asked. Oh well.",0
"ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT: THE FILM BY ITSELF IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, THE COPY IS OK THE PACKAGING IS CRAPPY, WHY WASN;T IT PUT IN A DVD BOOK CASE?I AM THINKING OF RETURNING. F.L.",0
"Very moving album: I have really enjoyed this album. Ms. Carlile is extremely talented, and a joy to listen to. I would highly recommend this album.",1
"no carbs: mainly for building lean muscles. [so if you're looking to bulk up look else where.] works great, not that tasty though. has 10g of BCAA and 4g of glutamine per serving which is good. personally i add another 5g of BCAA and 7g of glutamine",1
"What was she thinking??: There is no possible excuse for this album. Whoever is responsible for chaining Sarah Brightman's divine voice to this atrocious selection of mediocrities ought to be sentenced to a lifetime of listening to William Shatner sing rap songs in subway tunnels. She sleepwalks through the entire thing, with the possible exception of the rather pretty title song, and only comes to life on ALWebber's ""Love Changes Everything."" The latter is available on other CDs and the former is not worth the price of this collection of messes, unless you are perverse enough to want to hear one of the best voices in creation singing ""nibby nob nooby bibby bop boopy"" on ""Good Morning Sunshine."" I just wasted nearly $35 on this disaster. Don't make the same mistake. Sarah, your last 3 or 4 CDs would go with me if I was ever to be stranded on a desert island, but I'd rather be on that desert island than listen to this again! What were you thinking???",0
68 year old Great grandfather: When I was a kid with 3 brothers and a sister I don't know how many copies we went through. My kids read it to thier kids and now my grand daughter reads it to her daughter. Sambo was always my hero. I never thought being white or black ever entered into it. It's to bad people are that narrow minded.,1
"More than Wonderful!: The book is truly wonderful! It gives you more than you can imagine and it would work quite nicely for the ""do it yourself"" folks. I highly recommend this book for beginners as well as seasoned crafters.",1
"THIS SOUNDS LIKE PUNK!!!!!!!!!!: I'M A HUGE SLAYER FAN, YA KNOW, BUT I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ALBUM, BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE PUNK! WHO WOULD'VE IMAGINED THAT A COVER ALBUM DEDICATED TO COVERING HARDCORE PUNK SONGS WOULD SOUND LIKE HARDCORE PUNK!! I FEEL SO DECEIVED, AND WANT MY MONEY BACK, SLAYER!!!!!!!!",0
Good while it lasted....: We had this DVD player for about 3 months and then one day we no longer had picture but could hear that the movie was playing. Customer service was contacted but did not reply. Based on the reviews from other customers it sounds like this is a common problem which is only treatable by the customer paying additional money in shipping and labor....,0
"A sad and personal look at the holocaust years: This book is beautifully written and extremely moving. I have read many holocaust books, but this one touched me the most. The personal accounts of the two sisters provide an incredible insight into the hardships they faced for all those years. My father is a holocaust survivor who never spoke about his experiences of the war years. Somehow, when reading this book, I felt as though it was speaking for him as well. In addition, the author touches on her feelings as the daughter of a holocaust survivor, which I could really relate to. An excellent book for anyone interested in reading about the holocaust.",1
"What a P.O.C!!!!: This Microwave is the biggest piece of crap...not only a month of having it did I have to take it in for repair, but now the glass plate exploded inside of it, when I went to wipe it down ALLL THE LETTERS WIPED OFF...Don't waste your money on this microwave!!!",0
"Just a Wonderful Read...: This book enabled me to discover that the correspondence between Oliver's poetry and traditional religious language provides a fresh perspective from which to enjoy her work.God of Dirt is an important study of a contemporary poet whose work is as likely to be read by a preacher in a pulpit as by an activist at an environmental rally, and will help us experience a new vision of the beauty of our world",1
"not good for dog hair: Bought this 10 weeks ago and dog hair keeps getting stuck under the belt and around the silver axle. It doesn't suck much of the hair to the filter because it gets under the belt stays there, makes awful noises after which you must take the entire thing apart. I vacuum every other day. In 10 weeks, I have had to take the bottom plate off, the belt off and clean the underneath 5 times and that is ridicules. Yes, I empty the dirt container and clean the filters too. So this is not at all a good machine for dog hair. My money thrown away. I bought it because my daughter has one and loves it but she has no pets. I guess it's good on regular dirt. Don't waste your money if you have pets that shed.",0
Poor Documentary or Horrible Drama?: I was very disappointed in the quality of the production. If this is supposed to be a documentary -- mostly told through voice over and the actors are not speaking English -- then it needs some citation for it's information. If it is supposed to be a drama -- the Bible scenes are acted out and there is scenery and costumes -- then it needs better actors. This group of actors was worse than watching a third grade performance.The biggest problem though is that no where on the DVD box or the videos themselves is it explained why these Biblical stories are being told this way. It was a waste of my money because there are much better documentaries out there and certainly much better dramas of the exact same stories.,0
A very good read: Enjoyed this series. Solving mysteries in different lands. You feel part of it. Read them years ago but fun to reread.,1
"Other low opinion valid: As another reviewer rated the book 1 star, I gave two. The example of 'the camel passing through the eye of a needle' truly has been invalidated as he pointed it and should only be described as a colloquially-accepted or fondly accepted definition- referring it to a ""gate"".The other reviewer also stated 'Oxford Companion to the Bible is a much better reference work- I own it; and agree. I thought this might be a tertiary reference (as I have two such), but I'm glad I read the reviews first! The good thing about this book, is it has and index by subject- unlike one of the books on my shelf by V. H. Matthews.",0
"Love this album: This is a great album, Big and Rich are a great band. I would recommend everyone buy it! Hurry up already :P",1
A Gem: Seldom have I found a CD as enjoyable. I have listened to it over 100 times and it remains my favorite of the year. The quitar work varies from introspective to joyous. I am sending a copy to all my friends.,1
"Scottish Borders were pretty lawless.: I was unfamiliar with this period of Scottish history,but was fascinated by this title. Chapters on the struggles of survival in the region on both sides,British and lowland Scots. I have no idea how factual this text is, but it puts a different spin on the ""good old days"". If you like scots history you should enjoy this interesting look at raiders,revenge, and law.",1
"One of the best volumes on Alexander McGillivray to date: This is one of the most fascinating books I have read on the subject of Alexander McGillivray and his family. New theories on his death with strong arguments and documentation give new insight on his impact and influence on the Creek Nation in regards to the Spanish and their distrust of him. Alexander McGillivray has long been overlooked as a great Indian Chief, trying to keep peace in the Creek Nation while keeping the powers of the Spanish, British and Americans at arms length.",1
great Trek stories: The animation is pretty bad. Just static figures whose mouths are the only thing that moves. However the stories for the most part are really good Trek. If you are a diehard fan of the original series you will enjoy the Trek Animated Series.,1
"2 Stars for the first Hour!: Not only should you see this feel if you need a good ""fright"" but if you need a good LAUGH! If not for the first hour of the flick I would pass this movie a no star-er! Grant it, the beggining was interesting..then, boom! By the middle it starts to loose it's impact giving it a Matrix meets Scary Movie type of feel. I'm not even going to go there with the ending..the only thing I must warn you about this film is to save your money and stay away from the sequel!",0
"So far, so good.: The device installed just as easy as advertised and works simply and well. The only test now is how well it will stand up to an ocean front climate. This went on a rental unit and will save a bunch of money and trips to the unit.",1
"A throwaway book: ""Jedi Trial"" adds little to the Star Wars expanded universe. It has a linear plot and poor character development. It does not feel like a Star Wars book. There are many little inconsistencies between this book and the movies/TV shows/other books. Skip this book.",0
"Not great: Sorry-- I don't know what people are raving about. I am an avid epicurean, and have gone to most good restaurants in NY. I just don't think Balthazar's recipes or food holds a candle to other NY institutions, like Gotham, Gramercy, etc. The food at and recipes from Balthazar always tastes a little too greasy and unrefined given how many steps are involved. Sorry, that's just my personal opinion after making almost ten of the Balthazar recipes.",0
"Sword & Sorcery Perfection!: With the notable exception of Karl Edward Wagner's The Road Of Kings, there is no finer Conan pastiche than this. This novel is flawlessly executed fantasy fun from start to finish. You'll never want it to end; it's a compulsive page-turner that puts lesser Conan pastiche writers to shame. Other reviewers have gone into their reviews in far more depth than I have time for at the moment, so I'll just say they are right! Buy this novel now. You won't regret it!",1
"Missing Pages: I was very disappointed to learn that 31 pages of the book I purchased were completely missing. It is very difficult to get into reading a book when that many pages at the beginning of the book are ""not there"" After a trip to the library to read the missing pages it is turning out to be an ""OK"" book. It is required reading for a high school class :(",0
Great multiplayer experience: This game is best enjoyed with friends. You (and up to 3 other people) can play as characters from the X-men and the Brotherhood. The character selection is diverse and the storyline is extremely full (sometimes the talking is a bit too much). The voice over work is fantastic and the gameplay is nicely done. This is great when you have friends over and want to play an offline multiplayer co-op game.,1
Whats going on?: O.K. the box says it works with the 05 EA sports games but theres no rumble if any one can help please send an e-mail thanx.,0
"A FANTASTIC BOOK!: I first saw this book on a web site that linked to Amazon.com. I clicked on the book, and came... well.. here! I read the reviews and almost everyone said it was a great book, so I bought it! Once I started it, I could not put it down! It's about a mouse on a quest to find the legendery sword of his heroic idle, while helping to deffend his land from evil rats.At first I was skeptical about getting it because a lot of people said it was like the Hobbit, which I didn't enjoy. But I really loved it and thought it was a great book!",1
"suprisingly cool: I got this wallet about a year and a half ago and have had no problems with it, except that the coin holder isn't very useful. It is kind of funny that the recorder is on the front of the wallet, in plain view, and yet no one seems to notice. If they do, they still don't know it's a recorder. They say ""what's that?"", and if they do I just turn the wallet over and say ""what are you talking about?"" That actually works! Overall, it is a good idea to make a wallet with such functions. I give it four stars because if I'm actually using it to pay for something sometimes the flashlight, the scope, and everything else falls out and I have a lot of explaining to do. But still, great toy!",1
"Amazing!: Got this for DH to use in his newest hobby. According to him, this is one of the best around. Don't know what else to say on it. Just know he's happy and loves this little thingy.",1
"Is that all there is?: How can Mr. Frazier craft his words so well yet say so little for so long about nothing. My expectations ran high after reading endless reviews of praise for Mr. Frazier's first novel, however, after plodding through the first 100 pages, it occurred to me that it is difficult to like a book when you simply don't like any of the characters. Ada is weak albeit much more interesting than Inman, but where is the late night, can't put down page turner I was anticipating? I cannot understand all the critical acclaim for this vapid piece of work, but I guess that's why there's chocolate and vanilla. I would not recommend this as a great read, a good read or even an okay read but a ""read at your own risk"" type of read. Buyer beware!",0
Does it's job: Keeps the dog out of it (after he opened one with the flip top lid) and fits an entire 27 lb bag of food,1
"Wonderful CD: This is a wonderful CD of familiar hymns played by two skilled guitarists.The artist's name is Brian Pinner, though, not Brian Finner.",1
Japanese Candies fan: These candies are great. The taste and the fizzle effect feel like drinking a soda. I really like them. Recomended purchase.,1
Mood for 12/ Solo Mood: This was the first record I ever bought (in the late fifties)and was happy to buy the CD because I have worn out the record. The CD sounds even better. In over forty years of listening I still rate this recording as one of my favorites.,1
"Fabrication and Fiction: After reading Manny Garcia's Book, I find it riddled with false information and the degrading of many fine and valorous soldiers that served in B Company 2/502nd Infantry 101st Airborne Division. I was a Platoon Leader in the 3rd Platoon and I have been in contact with many members who were there at the same time as his time period. So far not one member remembers him or his supposed exploits. There never was a combat jump on a NVA Hospital, pure fiction, He was not a graduate of the Ranger School (Can be verified thru the Freedom of Information Act), the list can go on and on. It is a shame that the University of New Mexico Press would print a book without checking it's authenticity. I'm sure many others members of this unit will also write reviews.",0
"Epic: In my opinion, this is easily Modest Mouse's best release to date. You can definitely feel its theme throughout the entire album, and it sounds just like what the album cover looks like. this album will take you to the warmest places in the universe (third planet, paper thin walls, gravity rides everything, wild pack of family dogs), to the loneliest, coldest outreaches of the universe (alone down there, the cold part) and to places right in between (lives, stars are projectors). As Isaac Brock discusses life, loneliness, space, time, the universe, love, you can feel your very own depersonalization from your life and into this album. No joke. Give it a few spins for it to kick in. Hell, just writing this review made me pull up my itunes and run the tracks.",1
"Don't bother: I bought this book knowing very little of Paganism. McColman did not give me a wonderful first impression of the religion. His book is comprised of what many Pagans would call ""fluffy bunny"" philosophy, as well as historical misinformation and the occasional bashing of monotheism as a way of making his own path look good. To anyone looking at this book to learn about the Pagan's spiritual path: avoid this one. It's oversimplified and has opinions and speculations presented as fact.",0
"Yuck: Half way through watching this I realized I had already seen it a few years ago, but it was so unremarkable I had forgotten all about it. Helen Hunt's character just has nothing going for her. She's cold and unappealing; her angst is uninteresting and seems self-centered. One wonders what the Colin Firth character (why there are 2 starts isatead of 1) sees in her. Normally I like these actors, but ... don't waste your time!",0
"Cult Movie-Somewhat Overrated.: It's becomea cult movie but is somewhat of a ""gutter ball"" - acting is not that great.",0
"Don't waste time or money on this dud: A 30 page novel, compressed into 453 pages of tedious, slow moving, irrelevant drivel. After 250 pages it began to move a little. After the first 200 or so pages, I began to skim the rest and really never missed a thing. The conclusion is really never in doubt. I only had to wade through randomly generated words for confirmation of what was expected all along. When I finished it, it was a relief. I could throw the book away and get to something interesting.If you liked SSN you may like this.Oh yes, the ending is a set up for a sequel. No thanks.",0
"Very disappointing!!: I purchased this camera 8 months ago. Still images are almost always blurry. The zoom quit working after just 4 months. The pictures come out grainy appearing, all no matter the setting. The flash works very poorly, as well, and you must be very close to your subject to have any effect. Also, there is a delay when you take a picture, of up to 4 seconds, so if you need a quick shot, it won't happen. I would not recommend this camera.",0
"Movie: This movie wasn't quite what we had in mind. It wasn't very appropriate for our teenager who really likes the Beatles. It wasn't rated so we hoped it would be good, but it wasn't.",0
"Something has gone terribly wrong...: I have two of these headsets for two offices.The first was purchased a few years ago and works great. The sound is clear, volume is good and even between TX/RX, and the mic boom is flexible and bendable rubber.The second one purchased is the one I'm reviewing here. The materials and quality are very different than from the first one I purchased. The earpiece sound is quiet yet the mic is extremely loud. While speaking with someone, I sound twice as loud as they do and you can hear the mic reaching it's limit and clipping. The mic boom is also hard, sharply curved, and totally nonadjustable. This means the mic is a fraction of an inch from my cheek and often bumps my cheek while moving around. If the mic boom were longer or straighter, this wouldn't be a problem. But the way it's designed and curved, it pokes right into the side of my cheek.",0
READ ABOUT GENEEN'S PERSONAL LIFE- NO THANKS!: This book is little more than a synopsis of Geneen Roth's life. I felt like I was reading her therapy files! Check it out from the library and read the first chapter- you'll decide not to waste the money,0
"Great first attempt by someone new to the movie scene: While I was one of the two oldest people in the theater (my friend being the other), I actually really enjoyed this movie BECAUSE it is a scary movie that I would be okay taking my twelve-year-old brother to see. If this was meant to cater to twenty-somethings, I might have been disappointed, but it's supposed to be for teenagers so I pretty much knew what to expect upon entering (not quite sure why others seem surprised). The camera work was fantastic, acting was pretty good (especially the kid that played Owen) if perhaps a little over-done at times, and the story line had a few twists. I will take my little brother to see this and be comfortable, and he will love it (as did the other teens in the theater). Not bad for a first-timer.",1
"full of baloney: Dr. Friel panders books and ideas as a business, and not as a means for truly helping his clients. ""The world according to Friel"" could be the title for all of his books.It's all fuzzy feel-good that boils down to ""woman good, man bad"".Seek real help elsewhere from someone that without this bias..",0
"Original artists, BUT rerecorded: Rerecorded Hits by the original singer, Age makes a difference. Most of the songs are almost unrecognizable from the original hit",0
"Range Claims exagerated: I got everything to work right out of the box pretty quickly and easily. Have three computers running through it, one using a standard rj45 cable, which works quite well. The other is using the MA311 PCI wireless card, and a Dell laptop using MA401. At a distance of 80 to 90 feet through the house the MA311 gets a 30% signal at best, and the MA401 gets 0% and will not connect to router. Tech support stepped me though a few things. But ended up telling me it's too far away from the base station, and that it was not really designed to function in a 2-Story Environment. I have limited experience with this type of networking but it seems that with a claim of 500 feet max range, an 80 foot distance should be working much better.",0
"My parents love it.: I bought one of these a year ago and my mom wouldn't share it with my dad. (They are both Colombian nationals and they recently moved to Canada) So they needed something portable that could help them with quick translations in English. Needless to say, my dad liked it so much I had to buy another one just for him. It has a voice feature that helps with the pronunciation of words and phrases. Nice product!",1
"I it not good: I thought its will be nice but it is not good at all.It is just one day then you have to tied it again , one day more then swing again. Its never be good until you through it away. If you did bought it yet then dont buy it.",0
"' Where The Red Fern Grows Part 2: I just read and read. Before I knew it I was crying and I had finshed the book.I hope you will read Where The Red Fern Grows , and like it as much as I did,...",1
"If you don't know MOZ...: ... then you have lived under a rock, but it is not too late to try and be hip. A great starter cd for nerds and shut ins!",1
Good mix: Scorpions Gold has the hits that made the Scorpions and more. Great songs and great sound. Playing this from different devices the sound is really great.,1
"Love them at $7.99 - won't buy them here for $3 more!: I am in my 5th year of diaper-buying & have found these truly to be the best diapers. HOWEVER, there is no reason for me to buy them at Amazon when I can use coupons at Rite Aid (which has basically the same retail) and pay much less.",0
Enjoyable to read but....: The book was a good read but it spends to much time on things that are not critical to the storyline. He spends to much time focusing on things that are not critical and then leaves you feeling cheated with a quick ending. It is an easy read for an 800 page book but could have been done in half that without losing much. The grafficly horrible characters like Demin Nass do not need such detail. I did overall enjoy the book but felt like it plagerized many other books previously written. I always new what was comming next like I had read it before and that is because I have in other books. Over all an ejoyable read but not for children or the weak hearted. Richard is a great champion and a well developed character as is Kalahn and Zedd is an ejoyable comic relief.,1

"Fantastic Heaphones: I received these headphones as gift and let me tell you, they have been great. I can now actually listen to the TV and let the little one sleep and not have to read everything in closed captioning. Once I figured out how to set the TV correctly, everything was great. There is occasional static depending on where I am sitting or laying, but I attribute that to the fact that the transmitter is set back in the cabinet since the cables are not long enough for better positioning.This thing is incredibly comfortable, I can wear for hours and they do no bother me at all, and it stays put. The volume knob is positioned to where, if you are resting your head on a pillow or the back of the couch, it gets turned, but that is my main complaint, and wouldn't return them because of it.Great product.",1
Awesome!: This is one of those great tv series that did not get much attention although it was amazing. It is funny and dramatic while still staying serious. I loved watching every minute of it on tv and now I can watch them when ever I want!,1
"Good concept, but a piece of junk: The coffeemaker failed after only using it twice - The unit would shut down after the cup was about 1/4 full. The overall quality was very disappointing - extremely flimsy construction - especially the lock handle.",0
"Buried Treasure: 3 bright gems shine on this CD.: Many folks have heard the song Aikea-Guinea on the compilation album The Pink Opaque. Whether or not you like that song, the 1985 Aikea-Guinea EP is worth buying for the other 3 songs not featured on any full-length album.Full track listing:1. Aikea-Guinea2. Kookaburra3. Quisquose4. RococoKookaburra and Quisquose (and actually Aikea-Guinea as well) sound almost as if they belong on the 1986 Love's Easy Tears EP. And Rococo is a wonderful, circular romp of an instrumental. This is an EP I always recommend to new and existing Cocteau Twins fans. It's one of my personal favorites.",1

"The Eight: Fantastic! Can't put it down, up till 2 a.m., adventure, thriller, who-done-it master piece. Puts The DaVince Code way back in the pack, and did it 20 years ago!! No wonder much of Europe considers it one of the top 10 books of the last century.Probably best to read on vacation ... because not only will you not want to go to work until you've finished, you won't want to cook or sleep.Read it!",1
Overpriced: I think that this book is way overpriced for what it is. I returned it. It was more braids than updos and barely any colored pictures.,0
"20th Century Classic: I have heard many, many albums in my time, and this may well be the best of 'em all. Lush melodies, regal arrangements, sharp vocals, and the unparallelled pop stylings of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Favorite songs include ""A Day in the Life"" and ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"". These guys have made beautiful music in the past, but this is one for the ages. A MUST buy.",1
"ZAPPA O LA ETERNIDAD: Es increible la modernidad de la musica de Zappa escuchada hoy en dia, por eso resulta especialmente gratificante escuchar esta grabacion de actuaciones en vivo del a√±o 1972¬°¬°¬°Jazz, rock, musica contemporanea..todo en el mismo paquete. Quizas este CD sea especialmente recomendable para los amantes del Zappa mas jazzistico que lo van a encontar en su salsa. Como siempre le acompa√±a una magnifica banda y los arreglos son insuperables. Una joya y un descubrimiento para aquellos que piensen en un Zappa discursivo y mordiente. Aqui lo que hay es pura musica de jazz con influencias de todo tipo, especialmente notable la de la musica del compositor Edgar Varese. Muy recomendable para aquellos que tengan ciertos reparos en la musica de Zappa.",1

"STICK WITH NINO'S ORIGINALS: A horrible diservice to the prodigious talents of a first-class singer...as others have said, if you want to truly hear Nino Bravo, hunt around for his out-of-print original Lps on CD or better yet get the excellent 3cd set LA OBRA COMPLETA DE NINO BRAVO...Yes, there are original numbers here by Nino but you can find all of them in the above-referenced CDThe duets here are horrible...taking Nino's original recordings and remixing them (badly) and ""arificially adding"" the voices of his duet partners (who do not hold a candle to Nino's incredible voice) was an abyssmal concept and a sorry attempt to cash in on Nino's legacy...avoid at all costs !",0
"Skip It: This story starts out hokey, remains hokey and ends hokey. In our modern world, neighbors don't even know each other's names, let alone care about whether or not they decorate their houses for Christmas or decide to take a trip to the islands. I know this book was intended to be fun, but it never even made me smile. I just thought it was stupid and a waste of time. From the reviews of the movie that just came out based on this book ""Christmas with the Kranks,"" the movie is just as bad as the book.",0
"BETTER LEFT ALONE: While Paul Shrader's typically lush, original version of the Exorcist prequel is infinitely better than Harlin's incoherent mess, it is still an exercise in futility. The original Exorcist has spawned nothing but srangely dense, difficult to swallow meanderings that have nothing to do with the heart, soul and terror of the original. It's as if the screenwriters and directors of all of these sequels and prequels and offshoots missed the commercial appeal of the first and only decent Exorcist movie: it was a basic, well-told story of good versus evil. It made the devil real. It was scary. Though there are moments in Dominion that have a strange, poetic beauty to them, the movie starts out in debt - it has no compelling story to tell.",0

"Tastes like the packaging it comes in: Well I guess in Brazil you can label something 100% Pure Coconut Water. This trash tastes like cardboard packaging, and sugar and vitamin C added? I am sorry, that is not 100%. I was not expecting real coconut milk, I understand it has to be pasteurized and processed to an extent. I love fresh coconut milk, I have a machete to cut the top off a coconut. However I live in the DC Metro and fresh coconuts are not exactly cheap. I just thought this would be a good, quick reminder of the real thing to drink on the go and not a can of soda. They picture this with a straw, it comes with no straws. Not happy with this purchase, and I question the safety of the product, obviously highly processed in some ""factory"". I really do not understand where the 5 star ratings are coming from on this product. I love Amazon, they should not sell trash like this.",0

"a rediscovered classic: so, in 8th grade my favorite band was ben folds five. why? because i was a geek/slacker, so was he. so there was a level of being able to relate. i eventually lost interest(as most 14 year olds do) & moved onto all sorts of music. 5 years past & about a month ago i was in my sisters room & noticed she had this cd...so i took it from her(she doesn't deserve it & i dont even know what happened to my copy.) i listened to it & my god it's just.....good. great song writing & Ben only further proves how great an instrument the piano is. & it's sad that all the 1 star reviews are simple pissing & moaning about how the rest of the album doesn't sound like 'Brick' which, yes, is a good song, but there are better tunes on the album. if you don't own it, stop wasting my air.",1

An essential guide to anatomy: Last's Anatomy is first and foremost a TEXTBOOK of anatomy. It does not pretend to be an ATLAS of anatomy as some readers find on opening it. The textual content is clinically relevant and maintains the highest degree of accuracy along with well thought out prose in describing essential facts in anatomy along with clinically relevant pearls. As a Clinician I am still amazed at how many of those pearls come into use on a daily basis on rounds and in clinic. Coupled with McMinn and Hutchings excellant Atlas this text should provide all needed instuction in Anatomy for medical students and residents alike.,1

Hopefully you will be inspired to stand up straight and shout ""Yes, Yes! That's exactly right!"" much as I was. Reading her words is like giving my soul pen and paper and being able to read the things it would write.",1

Bob's Review.: This album is similar to the other ones from Mythos. It is probably not their best one however as one listens to it more and more it does get better. Mythos is not one of those bands who pretend to get some musical point across. They are true to their own voice and sound. Their music helps to search corners of one's mind. This is probably I enjoy their music. I am also a fan of Amethystium. These two bands stand right near each other like a brother and a sister. Thumbs up!,1
No Extras: What a rip-off. No extras until November release of another DVD. Don't buy this release - send the money grubbing studios a message. How much $$$$ money do they need to milk from consumers? This was the number one grossing movie of all time. Scum.,0
"RIVETING!: The book Marlfox is about a group of mystical foxes who travelto Redwall Abbey in hopes of plundering and taking over. Their planis to take their treasure back to Castle Marl for their evil and greedy mother. Can the simple country folk of Redwall survive this vicious attack? What I really like about this book is the fact that the plot twists around and has you thinking one thing but something totaly different occurs. I also like how the author goes onto such detail describing the great feasts that Redwall often has. This is a wonderful book with deliteful characters, I give it a full five stars. I would recommend this tale to people of any age who love adventure and comedy.",1

The simpering Emily, the sex-starved Celete, the self-absorbed men. Yuk.

""Disappearing Grace"" was also better, but this one seems like a turkey.",0

What sim city 3000 does is make me want to play sim city 2000!(yuch) That is an awful feeling after plunking down the $$'s. All I can say is that I know this game is a big compromise to the original intentions of the designers. if you remember Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, by bullfrog, you know exatly what I mean and how I feel about the crapyness of Sim City 3000.IF SIM CITY 2000 DID NOT EXIST I would have rated Sim City 3000 31/2-4 stars.",0
"An Epic Piece: For those who have not listened to Eloy before, I highly recommend this masterpiece. There is something fascinating about Ocean. It is an art- rock epic that fuses Yes and Pink Floyd, but you will not find it too complicated. Actually, it is so malted and seriously done that it really deserves to be a part of every A-Z collection. You will understand why this title is one of cult albums from the seventies. Always in their own world, Eloy just could not make anything better than to prove that there are some great rock bands in the rest of Europe. In Germany, Eloy is known as their ""best art-rock band ever"". Frank Bornemann, Klaus-Peter Matziol, Detlev Schmidtchen, and Jurgen Rosenthal made it so well in 1977. Twenty two years later, their Ocean is still big. I hope you will dive into its water. Good luck!",1

"would not turn on after 3 uses!: I don't know what to say about this product. I was convinced it was well worth the money after reading some of the reviews, but after 3 uses it would not turn on anymore! I have no idea what happened. Luckily I purchased it through Amazon, and they are sending me a new one right away. So a word of caution: buy through Amazon in case it breaks; then you have a guarantee that they will replace it if it's less than one month old. Hopefully the new one will live up to the hype! I have been wanting a CHI for years now.",0

"Review of the movie ""Hypothermia"": It was poorly made with a poor plot and bad acting. The so called monster was like one from the 1940s or 1950s. It was a struggle to watch it to the end. The only thing that made sense was the title, "" Hypothermia"".",0
"Great songs and a not so great Singer: I can't argue about the selection of songs here. They are classics for a reason. They are some of the best loved show tunes of all time! But the delivery by the singer here is not good. She is loud and unemotional and never moved me. I thought it would be hard not to be moved by the song Memory but Kim Criswell did it. If you love Broadway, there are much better albums than this.",0
"Don't pigeonhole this as ""military history"": It would be a shame to classify this book as ""military history,"" since the term is bound to turn away some readers. Certainly this narrative of the lives of some members of the West Point class of 1966 follows them into combat, and Atkinson is a masterful writer in this genre. However, what is most interesting about this book is the way it describes the intersection---one might even say collision--of the values and education imparted by West Point with the rapidly changing culture of the sixties and seventies. In addition, Atkinson's examination of the lingering deleterious effects on the Army of an unpopular and unsuccessful war is enough to make one wonder what the consequences of the current unpopular war will be. This book, which often reads like a novel, ought to be in the hands of students, most of whom have little connection to the war in Iraq and little understanding of military life, unlike their sixties counterparts, who at least faced the draft.",1
Spellbinding: This track is a spectacular vision of the true style of trance and electronic combined. The sounds used in this song create a true sense of being in the place which this song is created. The different tribal horns and other such instruments create a true essence of relaxation and dance at the same time. This song is so versitile in its uses so one can enjoy it anytime.,1
"One word. Greedo.: The word Greedo can sum up two major points of these dvds.1. He does NOT shoot first. Why would Lucas feel the need to change this? And Greedo must have had one too many Cantina drinks if he could miss from a distance of 1 foot...2. Greedo - o = greed.Lucas and his Special Editions, terrible new trilogy, edits, etc, are nothing but a chance to milk the franchise dry. Leave the classics alone!

"Too good, too short: I'm not going to go over the plot with you,I'm just here to tell you what I like and dislike. What I like? That's easy. Meg Cabot has once again outdone herself with this novel. Like I said, I'm not going to go over the plot, so you will have to read it or wonder for the rest of your life(okay, exaggeration). Dislikes: Just one. IT IS NINETY-SIX PAGES! I know, I know. Book 4 1/2 was fifty pages. What is the problem here? I'll tell you: This isn't a in-between book. It is supposed to be equivalent to 150 page novels previously written by Meg Cabot. Not to mention the fact that 4 1/2 had pretty much NO plot, whereas this one has a real setting, story, and more than ten characters.That is all I have to say. Oh, yeah, one more thing:READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Nice Graphical Book: In order for me to build my Titanic model (to my standards) I needed references. This book does not hold back! It is a large book though not thick. Although it is meat to show the inside of the ship, the author did a great job showing the outside detail as well. Great book for the Titanic enthusiast. Mostly artistic renderings it shows the workings behind the steel hull. I found it enjoyable and educational.",1

"Peugeot Saly & Pepper Mills - a classic pair: This set is the perfect, classic set of salt and pepper mills. The matte chocolate finish has the richness of dark, stained wood without the glare of shiny glaze. The top of each one has a small ""S"" or ""P"" on the top screw so you know which is which. The only negative is (like all mills) a bit of the pepper or salt falls out onto the counter or table every time you put it down. Still, a fabulous, high-quality set for all upscale kitchens.",1

Covered more advanced features that I probably will not used - with the same detail, explanations and graphics.Job well done to all involved.",1
"Is this the best they can do?: Can someone tell me what this movie was about?The plot (if there WAS one) was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again (and have done) in spite of Edward Furlong's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor.There's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED.One HUGE disappointment. Sorry - I WON'T ""be back"" if this is the best they can do!!",0
"Nice little oven: I am renovating my kitchen and needed a little oven to do basic cooking and warming up of food. This little oven works well. I've never owned a toaster oven before so I was a little hesitant to use this the first time but I've gotten over that. The one thing I don't like is, the baking tray is a bit small and there is no utensil to pull the baking tray out, other than that, all is well so far.",1
"Sweet: The story is sweet and well written. I do not usually recommend books, but this one is definitely above average.",1
"Less of a polemic than I expected: I was sure, when I picked up this book, that it would push me back toward those years in the 70s when we all seemed to think that vegetarianism was the logical answer just about everything that was wrong with the world. So I was surprised that Eric Schlosser wasn't really pushing that philosophy; he's not truly anti-hamburger, he's just in favor of healthy hamburger. Healthy for everyone: cowboys, consumers, corporations, and even the cows.One effect of those who read Fast Food Nation will probably be a severe lessening in how mindlessly they turn into McDonald's or Burger King when hunger hits on the Interstate. Instead, you just might find yourself looking for kosher and organic meats and packing your own lunches before heading off on a trip to Disneyland.A much-needed book.",1
"Excellent commentary: I love this easy to read, and easy to understand, commentary. Often when I look something up I find myself just reading on and on... I love it.",1
"Dreams Are What Matters: Everyone has a dream. A project by which they define themselves, their self-esteem, and as Ernest Becker would have it, deny death. This movie takes that concept to illogical, entertaining, and heart-warming extremes. Not to mention the wonderful acting.",1
"If you've got a decent sound card...: ...you probably don't need one of these.I'm feeling like an idiot right now because I bought this thing BEFORE I tried plugging my computer straight into my stereo. D'oh!!!A 1/8"" stereo plug-RCA adapter and RCA cable from Radio Shack do the same job as this thing. Just plug it into your computer's headphone jack, and you're all set. I did a side-by-side comparison between this thing and the stuff I bought at the Shack and there's NO discernible difference. I guess there are some situations where interference inside your computer and/or a weak sound card will make this not work so well, and in this case I'm sure this product would be perfect; it definitely works as advertised. But I would HIGHLY recommend you try the Radio Shack version for $12 before you buy one of these.",0
"Don't be so serious Bond is fictional: I decided to leave this after reading a few reviews of this SPOOF of Bond. People are actually upset that someone dared to make fun of James Bond. Give me a break how seriously can we take it after Timothy Dalton played 007 ?The history given in one review does lead you to believe some of this movie was playing ""catch-up"" and no it's not hilarious but definitely funny and as someone who has seen every commercially successful Bond including R.Moore, S.Connery , T. Dalton, P. Brosnan and G. Lazenby this is funny. You can definitely see ""Austin Powers"" in it as well as a few other movies, but one must keep in mind this is british humor so you won't be slapping your knee or falling off the sofa.Frankly, I have more of an issue with Daniel Craig playing the early Bond instead of some younger Brit, but he was excellent in ""Layer Cake"" so I guess we'll give him a chance although not thrilled with Eva Green as Vespa Lynd, she's no Ursula Andress.",1
"Didn't work: As in one of the other reviews, I received this item and it would not power on. I exchanged it for another one, same thing. Amazon exchanged it again (they do have good customer service) and now, on my third different Shoqbox it will NOT power on. So it's useless. Not sure if this is just Amazon stock or what, but I have now been through 3 of these and not 1 would turn on. Can't comment on it's features since I couldn't use it, but it is a good concept, but maybe replaceable batteries would have been a good idea. (and of course expandable memory).",0
"A tad disappointing ...: Not only did I read and love Silence of the Lambs but after Isaw the movie I vowed never to see it again because it frightened meso. Needless to say, I too, waited in anticipation for the sequel and was more than disappointed. The book started out catchy and kept my interest for a while. Then it was a little hard to follow when the plot switched to Italy, but that turned out to be okay. Even the ""brain-eating"" storyline in the ending lived up to my Lecter expectations. But about the very end with Hannabal and Clarrice ""hooking up""....all I can say is, ""Mr. Harris, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?"". Therefore, my recommendation is~ do not waste your money on this like I did.",0
"Rowenta: I decided for a Rowenta iron since it is consider one of the best brands. Very disappointed ! It broke after 6 months ! The steam hardly was coming out of the iron,couldn't handle my linen dresses or even cotton shirts. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.",0
"Fantastic: I have never been a die-hard Nirvana fan (though they've had some fantastic moments, like 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', the In Utero album...or this one) but this IS a very impressive recording. 'Unplugged on MTV' records are usually just plain boring, but Nirvana does hypnotic versions of Nirvana classics as well as cover songs by somewhat obscure bands like Meat Puppets (three songs actually), in a stripped-down way.It's hard to say exactly what makes this record so good, but if you want to know I suggest you listen to the cover of 'Jesus Don't Want Be For A Sunbeam'. There's a word for it: magic.",1

"Another great outing for Nicholas Cage: Many famous actors start out in the action genre and then try to branch out into other types of movies such as comedy, drama, romance, etc... Many fail; examples include Sylvester Stallone, Keanu Reeves, and Bruce Willis. Nicholas Cage however, has done a decent job of doing movies outside of the shoot-em-up action. This under-rated sci-fi drama from 2009 is a good example. Heading a cast of mostly nobodies, Cage plays a widowed scientist whose son comes into the possession of knowledge of the future, including the end of the world. The movie then revolves around them figuring out what to do next. There are some action scenes, but the movie is really a sci-fi drama. Overall, great story with good dialogue and a great ending.",1

"Stupid White Men...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State...: Not Moore's best effort. He was more factual and funny in his earlier works on film & television. I have no interest in the liberal/conservate conflict, so I find the bias in this book anti-intellectual. Playing loose with the facts will only please the ignorant. If you are that, you will love this book. I'm sorry to say this, but the only truly stupid white man in this book is the author. I hope he will do better work in the future. By the way, I am not white, and it should not matter anyway. I am a student of history, and this is no history book.",0

"Business Process Improvement: With todays blurring migration of Business and IT there are few down to earth ""How to get the job done"" BPI books. Very few books bring together the real aspects of business definition and quality management. You can't fix what you don't understand and you can't understand what to improve without a process to get there. Mr Harrington's BPI and his companion workbook are two must have books. They are a common sense approach to Process Improvement and very different from many of todays buzz word author's that try to mix BPM, Six Sigma, and Total Quality Management with the technologies of BPMN, BPEL, and Workflow - these simply become distractions to the real goals of assurance and continous improvement - which is what businesses today our trying to imbed. Harrington's BPI companion books are an excellent orientation and guideline to Administrative Business Process Improvement (ABPI)- the bulk of improvment projects in todays US economy.",1
"used bin: Well UL is a band that I used to be real big on, but their last few albums have let me down. I guess it is all for the sake of growth, but ELVA is all over the map, and not what I want to hear from these guys. Stick to driving melodic punk songs and quit the experimenting. I can't really pick too many songs that stood out on this album, and there were plenty that I had to skip through because they just don't work. UL, please go back to your roots, and put out a solid album that rocks. OH, you can probably find my copy of this album in a used bin somewhere in San Diego, I'm selling it ASAP.",0
"Alarm Clock: This clock dose not work. It drops the time and does not even work with the battery.The night light does not stays on, it lights up for a second and then cuts off. When I insert the battery, the clock does not come on, only the night light and then it cuts off.THE CLOCK DOES NOT WORK. I have wasted my money. it is not a good buy.I think its only fair that I should be refunded.",0
"BEWARE: Buyers Beware. I have been an amazon customer for years. I read all the reviews and was ready for my Calphalon pan to arrive. You will also note that this item was sold , not from a third party distributor but from Amazon itself. What I received was not the Calphalon pan I ordered but a Chinese knock off. I was shocked. It came in a unmarked white box with ""Made in China"" Printed on the outside. No where on the box or inside the box or even on the pan does it say Calphalon. Slipped in with the pan was a single general brochure for Calphalon cookware. I looked at the picture of the pan in the brochure and it didn't even look like the one in the picture. The handles were different, the marking were different and it looked like, well a cheap knock off. I am sending mine straight back to Amazon.As a loyal Amazonian I am just floored.",0
"Poor quality: Our first Black & Decker coffee maker didn't even last a year. . . the water pump stopped working. We took it back to Wal-Mart for a replacement and was sorely disappointed that the new Black & Decker carafe dripped no matter how careful or slowly we poured. It's strange because it looked like the same design as the last one which didn't leak. Back to Wal-Mart for our money back. Now we are wondering if there is a coffee maker out there that can make a good, hot cup of coffee that is convenient, easy to use & clean, drip free and still reasonably priced. Also bought a Black & Decker iron that leaks like a sieve. Perhaps B & D needs to go back to the drawing board and design products that are leak proof!",0
Not a Dan Brown: I bought this book based on buyer's reviews. I was very disappointed. This book is filled with much violence and little mystery/content.,0
"Great way to get more protein: I absolutely love this protein shake. i have only tried the vanilla and i use it in fruit smoothies that i make it smells great and taste great. I like that it comes from pea,soy,and rice protein. It has been my favorite protein shake and i like that it does not use splenda or any fake sugars that i dont want. I love it and have used it for years!!",1
"Difficult, plodding book: This is a historically-based tale of Gunnhild, a legendary Viking queen of the 10th century, and a sort of Livia of her day. She schemes and charms her way into a position of power as the wife of the King of Norway, then uses her magical talents to keep herself there and to support her husband and their children. She makes too many enemies, though, and most of her schemes come to naught.I was kind of disappointed in this book. The characters never came alive for me, and for most of the time I found myself plodding through the text, made more difficult by the Norse names and turns of phrase. Maybe I should go back and read Anderson's Tau Zero, of which I have fond memories.",0
"A brave but disappointing debut CD.: Having loved Audra McDonald in ""Carousel,"" ""Master Class"" and ""Ragtime,"" I eagerly awaited her debut CD and couldn't wait to get it in my CD player. But this is a collection of songs that is quite difficult to wrap your ears around. The lyrical content is good, but the melodies try very hard to out-do Sondheim in terms of atonal histrionics. The result is a screeching mess. While McDonald should be applauded for taking artistic chances, I had hoped this CD would showcase her superior voice in a better way.",0
"Concise, quick, required reading for true understanding: Chomsky's other, longer writings tend to be very thick and academic, rather hard to read. This series of books, however, get right to the point, and without watering down the topic.These books brilliantly and convincingly put the post World War II world into perspective. What is really going on. Not ""who killed JFK"" wacko conspiracy. Not Left vs. Rightbickering. Just plain and simple reality, the kind of thing you rarely see in the mainstream. Search INFOSEEK for ""the grand area"" for my web site.",1
"Not suitable for the beginner: Mr. Schiller has a PhD, but his book does not reflect much quality control went into its composition. There are missing figures, but yet referenced in the text. The book lacks an index. Several words are abbreviated, but there is no apparent explanation for them. I get the feeling this book went from first draft directly to publication. The hefty price is not justified. I am glad I only borrowed it from a library. The one purpose of the book seems to be to promote Excel spreadsheets he has created to track the OEX; and their prices are equally inflated. Why must you, Mr. Schiller, sell them from Spain? Isn't trading the OEX sufficiently profitable by itself?",0
These are different METAL springs. Do not buy!: I purchased these a few months ago and they were the plastic springs. They were wonderful and the cats loved them. I just ordered another set and what arrived are crappy metal springs in flaking paint. This is totally unacceptable and I'm sending them back today. Hello Amazon: talk to this supplier! What they have listed and what they are shipping are two different things. If it was possible I'd give zero stars. DO NOT BUY THESE!,0
"Intriguing, Funny, & Engaging: The show always surprises me. It's full of humor, drama, and I'm always left wanting more. Not your cookie cutter police/crime drama. Stories are ever changing & I never feel like I've seen it before or even anything similar. Beckett & Castle have great chemistry. No one could play Richard Castle better then Nathan Fillion. He is a perfect fit. I'm hoping this show will be around for along time. Lifelong fan...",1
"Disappointed Coffee Lover: Dear Cuisinart,Great Concept, Great Look but why can't this wonderful idea deliver DEEP, RICH, HOT, GREAT QUALITY coffee? It is amazing that you would put so much time and design ideas into a coffee maker without thinking about WHY YOUR CUSTOMER WOULD DECIDE TO BUY THIS UNIT: I grind high quality beans in order to enjoy a rich high quality cup of coffee at home. This coffeemaker delivers weak, warm but not hot coffee. Clean up is not as bad as most are saying and the grinder is not that loud, but we want great (not average) coffee from your coffee maker. Unfortunately, the Braun flavor select unit I used to own for years does not grind it's own beans, but I am returning the Cuisinart for the Braun today. (PS: You never answered my email or call regarding these issues.)",0
"Dubious Authenticity: Forensic evidence, such as proof that large portions of this ""diary"" were written with a ballpoint pen, not generally available in the years in question, has cast doubt on the authenticity of this volume. I do not purport to know if it is true or not. It is certainly moving, as is much Holocaust literature, whether authentic or fraudulent. What is far more disturbing is that merely questioning the authorship, or debating the numbers of persons killed in the Holocaust, has become a crime in much of the formerly ""Free World."" Another reviewer notes with evident approval that the French historian Robert Faurisson has been dismissed from his position, convicted, fined, and barred from employment for raising such questions. This is incredible! Is it not ironic that the freedoms we supposedly fought WW II to preserve have been erased in the name of remembering the terrors of Hitlerism?",0
"Avoid this model: I will say up front, we have the AS-185 instead of an AS-175, but check the reservoir fill on this model!! It is a COMPLETE pain in the backside!!Turkey baster, syringe, NOTHING is convenient to insert water into this puppy.We've had it less than a year, there is a part of the handle that is peeling back for some reason and, it may have been our fault, but it's already leaking out the footplate and at the base. No matter if it's horizontal or vertical. We haven't consistently used tap water or distilled water, so I can't say if that didn't contribute to the leakage.We did like the size of the footplate and the steam shot. I did not like the inability to store the cord around the iron in any fashion.",0
"Beware of Kindle edition due to printing errors: If you buy the Kindle version, you must be prepared for numerous, and I mean numerous, spelling mistakes.

At times, the mistakes average one per page, so if having to guess at what the text means annoys you, buy the paper version instead.",1
9 year old pencil sharpener freak: when I first got my sharpener I loved it!

"Trite, Surfacy, and a Bore: As a former anoretic I found the off-handed, immature approach to the disease insulting. It makes anoretics appear shallow, stupid, and sarcastically trivial. I absolutely could not relate to the experience of the author. Yes, she makes some stabs at dry humor throughout, but it only makes her careless treatment of the disease all the more distasteful. To truly relate to the heart of an anoretic, read Wasted by Marya Hornbacher.",0
hmmm: Unfortunately I do not have yoke or pedals and no number pad to work some of the features. Using F3 and F4 ect. for speed doesn't make the game a great deal of fun unless you like crashing and burning and not finishing any missions.

Truly awful: I love movies and almost never hate one. I hated this movie. The camerawork at the start of the movie almost gave me motion sickness. The story was violent and boring at the same time- not an easy feat. I truly cannot understand the good reviews it received.,0

Not a fan: It is not like the the old rollercoaster tycoon and is a bit complicated. The food stands and rollercoasters do not have the design and the game has a lot of limits on how to build your coaster. I think It could just be me and not playing the game enough. I got bored with this game.,0
"DRM? You're kidding me. Way to FAIL.: Unbelievable. I came here ready to shell out $50 for the game. Literally, my credit card is on the table. If it's good, I was going to buy two more copies for my sisters whose birthdays are this month.FORGET IT. DRM that is based on changes of certain piece of hardware is the most draconian, backwards form there is.Dear EA: Instead of selling this game and gaining customers who would tell others about it... you've managed to do almost the exact opposite. You've alienated your fan base and created a small army of people who will warn other potential customers about the aggressive DRM.",0

data unclear: I was quite surprised to see when i got the package that I had paid several times more for a box of 3 packets than 1 box of 4 packets. Perhaps I missed the note on the original package that it was only 3 packets but I certainly wouldn't order again at these prices.,0
"The Book Thief: It took me a while to get into it and almost put it down. However, when I did finally get past the first 50 or 60 pages, I was glad I stuck with it. It is an excellent story about a young girl growing up in Germany during World War 2 and how the war affected her family and her life. Thought-provoking.",1

"War Weary: I will say this for Weber: It took 8 or 9 decent books for this series to run out of steam.Too bad, because the early books were really enjoyable. As other folks have said, ""War of Honor"" is a bit of a chore to read.Also, as other folks have pointed out, really the strongest aspect of the series is reading about Honor Harrington kicking *ss. Which is largely absent from ""War of Honor.""The truth is that ""War of Honor"" could have been decent if it had been edited down. Instead we're saddled with (literally) hundreds of pages of internal monologue, silly banter, and C-SPANesque discussion.",0
"Fantastic Book: If you want a real reference book for .Net programming, this is it. He goes into depth in explaining how things work. Especially liked his chapter on Multithreading. It is a gold-mine for a professional C# programmer.PS. The guy who gave this book a low rating, probably hasn't done anything sophisticated with .Net yet. Hey, its a reference book and his writing style is clear and to the point.",1
"Smashing work for 13 year old Atwater-Rhodes!: Risika is a three hundred year-old vampire who can not forget her past. Though she hunts and kills, she remembers a life in the 1700s which was filled with a close family (including a twin brother) and a fear of the damned. Unfortunately for Risika, she is one of the damed now. In the Forests of the Night jumps back and forth between present day and the 1700s in order to weave a tale of how Rachel became Risika. She has a deadly rivalry against Aubrey, the vampire who killed her brother and beat her in a fight. She refuses to be weak in Aubrey's eyes and enters his territory even after repeated warnings not to. Finally, she decides to challenge him. What will be the outcome?A good book. Amazingly written for a 13 year old. I liked Demon In My View better though.",1
Gray Be-gone: Garnier Nutrisse covers the gray very well but the color only lasts for 4 weeks. This is okay because it is not harsh on your hair.

The battery life is extended a year or two on each. These machines are also ready to go when I need them"". And now I have to add--This tender worked great for 22 months. When I called the manufacturer they said that it would cost me $12.95 in shipping to get the new one. This is after I paid to ship the defective one to them. I would recommend some of their other models that have a longer warranty, this seems to say something. Most are 5 years and this one is 3 years.",0

"Simple Yet True: Essentially this is a compilation of highlights from a life Jim Rohn presentation. I REALLY liked it, not because there was anything novel... but because he provides solid examples with entertaining stories to back them up. I don't listen to the radio anymore, but use products like these to pump positive information into my mind, body and soul. It is light yet has an amazing impact on your attitude! Plus, it is not overly lengthy and you don't feel obligated to write anything down. Repeated passive (and ACTIVE!) listening goes a long way to absorbing these priceless lessons!",1

"Flower Power!: This is a cute necklace that has a wonderful texture. The craftsmanship could use a little improvement, there is more silver showing on the edges of the petals than I would care for.

"A walk in History: This book recounts the years of the Clinton presidency, from a historic view point. The drama of these years is discussed, but the impact of the trips to foreign nations and the difficulty of raising a family take center stage. Yes, we get the writer's political views, but the interest is in the peoples and place traveled. She shares with us what she learned on all thosetrips paid for with our tax payer dollars. If you can set aside your preconceived politacal beliefs, there is allot to be learned about our world in these pages.",1
"LOVE A DARK, BROODING, DOMINANT HERO & A BODICE-RIPPER TOO !: An alluring story of unbridled passion, young love, betrayal, a real page-turner & what a turn on ! The huge gap in age reminded me a bit of Jane Feather's characters. So what if Justin is cruel & heartless on the outside ? He's only embracing his belief that if he can't have Megan, no one can either. Just my kind of hero, a tortured soul, he put his heart up on his sleeves & came roaring back when he couldn't have her anymore. He did what his desperate mind told him to do, the only way to bind Megan to him is by kidnapping her. A rape is too harsh a description (Mrs. giggles' review) for Justin's lovemaking to the reluctant-but-as-much-in-love Megan. I just wish there were more authors as magnificent as Ms. Robards out there. Plenty of heart-pounding battles of will & toes-curling sex with an ending that'll leave U sniffling for a box of kleenex !",1
"BAD MONKEY! BAD!: This is just bad. If anyone would take the time to step back and think about what is said, objectively, the ideas in the book can not stand up by themselves. If readers are looking for a book that really makes them think, let me Recommend Italo Calvino's ""Ideal Cities"". It provides a base for thought without conjuring up weak solutions for out problems.",0

"Zzzzzzz: I was excited to watch this series after hearing all of the positive critical buzz and Emmy awards stumbling all over themselves to give this show nominations. I was bored from the get go, but decided I would give it a season to be fair. After watching season 1, all I've discovered is that I've found a cure to my insomnia.The show is slow, horribly acted by stiff and uninteresting characters, and absolutely nothing of consequence happened during the entire first season. I will not be wasting my time or money on any future seasons. How the Emmy awards can give nominations and awards for drivel like this and completely ignore the far superior ""Friday Night Lights"" is baffling. I guess if you enjoy smoking, this would be a great advertisement.",0

"Very good story.: Tom Selleck does a great job portraying a small town police chief dealing with a serial type killing spree taking place. A sleeper of a movie, it will keep you entertained and on the edge, although movie makers still have the ""I know what's going to happen next"" theme, the movie moves very well and doesn't carry a lot of baggage.Violence, laughter, friendship and love story all in one! What more can you ask for. Well, maybe a few more details would've been nice, but for overall viewing it was great!",1
"Peaceful and Soothing: This CD is one of my favorite CDs by one of my favorite artists. With all of it's soft, peaceful melodies, I played this constantly while I was pregnant, and after my baby was born, one of my favorite cuts, ""Ageless Messengers,"" seemed to sooth her and calm her very quickly.

Listening to this CD always seemed to help me slow down, reflect and appreciate what is really important in this life. The music has a sense of peace.",1
"Well-written, thought-provoking essays for general readers.: I enjoyed Paul Krugman's ""The Accidental Theorist"" a great deal. Each of the 27 essays is short, well-written, and thought-provoking. I especially liked ""What Is Wrong With Japan?"" and ""Looking Backward"", an astonishing piece written from the point of view of an economist looking back over the last 100 years from his vantage point in 2096.The author explains complex economic ideas in terms that laymen can easily understand. In ""Delusions of Growth"", he summarizes monetary policy by using a baby-sitting co-op as a model!Paul's viewpoint is from the left. I viewed this as a welcome change, a counterbalance to years of reading the conservative slant of the Wall Street Journal.",1

"Excellent but...: It's an excellent product, and as others posted here.So I will just focus on the cons:1) VBR: The ""remain time"" shown on the LCD for VBR mp3 files are not accurate. The SP250 will always overestimate the total time for VBR files.2) the total quality. I connect the line out to my Yamaha receiver, and play a max 320bps VBR lame-3.89 compressed ""Hotel California XRCD"", compare to the DTS DVD version. I can still notice the difference, which I believe not because of the mp3, but the player itself.",1

I tell the clerk that I like what I hear and he gives me that bands name... Pity it was the only copy they had. SO... a month later I see Wacko Magneto in the listening station. I recall the band & I give it another listen... The first song, ""Stop Counting"" grabbed me and pulled me away like a wonderful memory... I listened to half of the album right there & bought it. You should do the same. This band has talent, a unique sound thats not too different. All the songs end in ways that just leave you with a complete feeling inside without sounding ""poppy"" in the slightest sense. Thanks, Ednaswap... for being one of mynew favorite bands. These are the guys who wrote the famos ""Torn"" song that Natalie I. covers. Give credit where it's do. Enjoy this album.",1
disappointment: WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!! Very disappointed. Spinner fell aprt with first spin and could not be fixed. Colorforms are flimsy. Grandchildren got bored because it did not work. Am returning.,0
"HDMI Connection is Awful: I bought this HDMI DVD player over the weekend and I was disappointed ended up returning it. First, it freezes in the middle of the movie while playing, and the other annoying part is when you open and eject the disc, there is annoying flashing light all over your tv monitor. I tried to connect trough composite connector and the problem was solved but the resolution was awful. What's the use of buying this product if you just connect it with composite connection. I think there's something wrong with HDMI connection and Toshiba must correct this problem.",0
"Beautiful watch!: I received this watch as a Christmas present and I adore it. It is substantial without being too heavy and dressy without being overdone. The diamonds are small but clear. They have a nice sparkle without being ""in your face."" The mother of pearl face is so much prettier than the picture shows.This watch is obviously a very nice timepiece. This is the first Bulova I have owned and I am very pleased with it so far.",1
"Great rotors: I purchased these for the rear axels of my 1992 Honda Accord EX Sedan.A great improvement over the cheap auto-parts store junk I had put on before. These resisted rust reasonably well and were rather quiet, even with Hawk HPS Performance Street brake pads. The rotors are even easy to replace. They fit like stock and worked at least as good as stock.For the money, these are worth it. The auto parts store knock offs might be cheaper, but in the long run, they will warp and rust long before these will. Great Product!",1
Did not work for me.: The vendor is superb. He gave me my money back without a quibble. The device is a great idea but very poorly implemented. It is fine for hanging low value replaceable items. Not for hanging high value lights or similar difficult to replace items.,0
Great accessory for the microwave: In my house corns is a big thing so this was the perfect accessory to purchase. Effective and works great. For the price it's a great deal thank you amaZon,1
"Good Quality: I bought this for a family member as a Christmas present 2 years ago. Good quality, a little expensive but my mother-in-law loved it so it didn't matter!",1
"Unusual...: It is a little embarassing to hear the beautiful and talented linda Purl attempt Bachrach's standard, ""This Guy's..."". The music is quite good, but the selections are very marginal.",0

"All Survivor DVD's: Ah bummer, I have only seen the past couple of survivor shows, now want to buy all first 20 Seasons and watch them like they are new as I have no idea who won any of them, but I see the producers made the unbelievable mistake of highlighting the winner of each season on each box buy putting their picture in the first row in the middle, i assume...how dumb can you get..darnit, i really wanted to watch these but why would i now...",0
"A guide to Biblical theology: Christians today find themselves in an environment where information of all types is easily and readily accessible. Most all subjects are open for the reading with a simple click of a mouse. In these times the Christian must be more discerning and grounded in Biblical faith than ever before. It is in this environment that Basic Bible Doctrines by Michael Gowens shines the brightest.BBD brings out the truth of the scripture plainly, and one page at the time. Most systematic theologies are weighty and can take great amounts of time and experience to work through. However, BBD brings forth these same concepts with a readable and accessible nature that laymen can easily understand.If you are looking for a book that makes the difficult doctrines of scripture come alive to the glory of Christ, look no further than Basic Bible Doctrines. No Christian library is complete without a copy.",1
"Disappointing: Disappointing - Ru Paul is an amazing and talented entertainer, and this movie did not showcase that great talent. It felt contrived through much of the movie - and the editing was DREADFUL! The story, the actors... the potential is all there... but the result was just plain disappointing.Such a shame.",0
Raddis: Still havent recieved my first issue! I actually forgot I ordered it! thanks for the heads up Amazon. I will be looking into the purchase.,0
The End?: Got this CD over a year ago and still can't get over the painful listeningof the once great Robbie Williams. Whatever happened? This looked like a rush effort to compete with the UK Top 40 newbies. Intensive Care is still a better effort than this. He badly need better material for the next release or we would lose him forever.,0
poor quality: The box and the product shellcase were labeled DIR-450. In reality I received a DIR-451. I ended up sending it back after wasting much time trying to solve the problem. Quality control at this company is very poor and the technical help isn't much better. This product deserves no rating in my opinion. Don't buy it.,0
"Don't waste the time/money.: The game is laggy, buggy, and not really worth your money/time. Even a fast machine will lag in multiplayer, and that's with only 2 players. The company behind the game, firefly, are so pathetic that they actually ask people to come to these sites and tell you guys how awesome the game is now. Well it's a lie. A patch has been available for days now but on their website it's still listed as ""delayed"". Just one example of their gross incompetence. Poorly made. Poorly supported. Money better spent elsewhere.",0
"LA Hip-Hop Crew Stuck in Second Gear: Despite breaking through with the Kanye West-assisted This Way in 2004, Dilated Peoples have created a niche for themselves, devoid of mainstream hip-hop's frills and the eccentric creativity of the left-field. Their once-commendable stoicism now translates as banality, not aided by this lacklustre set, filled with beats that Eminem would be ashamed of. The malaise even extends to some very ordinary scratching from the usually impeccable DJ Babu, while it takes guest Talib Kweli to deliver the LP's best verse on Kindness For Weakness.",0
"welllll!!!!!: Considering the authors lack of historical, survivalist, western or overall knowledge on the topics it is a story. Just glad that the commune started out with plenty of money so we had a happy ending.",0
"Worth the effort: I'm a huge fan of vampire fiction and movies and found this book listed on some websites. When I sat down to read it, I discovered it was a reprint of one of the first serious books on vampirism, so the style and type is old fashioned. Still, it's definitely worth the read. After all, vampires are the most fascinating of all creatures in folklore. I think that it is a very good book for first time vampire readers, and will help dispel the misconception that vampires are all from Central Europe. It was cool to read about British fiends and Persian ghouls.",1
"Good thriller, lousy DVD.: Bravo MGM; you've managed yet again to screw up a great movie with a terrible DVD. -It's actually an ORION picture, and I'd hoped that they would've cared more about its appearance, but no such luck. Of my 100+ DVDs, this is one of the worst looking with dull colors and a fuzzy image. (Let's hope they're more careful with their upcoming Woody Allen ORION collection.) This is a rather oldfashioned straight-ahead action suspenser like they just don't make them anymore in Hollywood, but it's difficult to be thrilled about that when you know you can enjoy a much sharper version on TV. Hackman, Heard, Cassidy and Jones lead a good cast, but in order to see them clearly we desperately need a remastering of this otherwise wonderful movie. Until then, avoid like the plague.",0
"photo of product is deceiving to the eye: I was very very displeased when I received my package of DAP puppy collars and it only contained ONE collar. The picture specifically shows two boxes throughout the whole ordering transaction therefore I believed I was getting two for the price of $16.83 I could have ordered One on another website for $9.99 So, in other words I thought I was getting a bargain. The images need to be changed because they are deceiving. Thanks once again for a waste of my money.........$22 total for One collar unbelievable. I guess you live and you learn.",0
"Increases appreciation of one of Hollywood's Greats: Chronicles the professional life and accomplishments of one of Hollywood's most loved stars, Burt Lancaster. I was disappointed with the lack of insight into the personal life of Lancaster, but as a biography of his professional life it was excellent. It was fascinating to read of the diametrically opposite views that co-stars and directors had for him, ranging from ardour to hate. This is an unbiased portrait of a great star",1
Disappointed: This is basically a play book with very little about teaching methods and techniques. The book talks about the center pass without explaining much about it. I have read the books by Dave Cisar on single wing and this book is no comparison Cisars system is much simpler to understand and teach. Don't waste your money here like I did.,0
"The Lone Star State: If you know very little about this very large state, this book is definitely for you. The various facts given are interesting and informative.",1
"Great Product: not better than Becker but it is almost as good; moreover, taking the price into account, it is better.",1
"Exorcism for Vietnam: In 1985 Nelson DeMille published a bestseller ""Word of Honor""which directed the spotlight on the lost war in Vietnam and much of the book exposed the government effort to forget it.Another 18 years later Don Johnson made a movie, in 2003, which is NR without a single objectionable scene,but had a most unfortunate timing.The 'Insurgents'of 2005 are the 'gooks' of 1975 and it does not look like hearts and minds are won now.After I saw the movie , I read the book and I admire Don Johnson for reviving this shameful subject and this story at the time of another 'war'.",1
"homerun: ....another 5* piece created by Dr. Kiev. The Psychology of Risk is an excellent tool to improve and build on one's trading technique. whether a novice or an expert, psychology of risk is a must read for all levels...",1
"Title covers it all: Europe for Dummies is a perfect book for a first or second time traveler to Europe. In March I went on a trip to four countries in Europe and took three different travel guides with me. Europe for Dummies was used much more than the other two that I had brought, and with justified reasons. A previous reviewer said it was too vague, and although I agree with them in some aspects, Europe for Dummies saved us more time and even money in some cases than I ever expected any of the books to. The descriptions are short and full of information, which is what I want when I am traveling. Detailed maps and directions also hellp make Europe for Dummies a great travel guide. Whether or not you would be buying this book to take with you, or to read it before you go on a trip to Europe, Europe for Dummies is a great source of information to prepare and inform you for the many awesome and surreal sights Europe has to offer. Definitely recomended.",1
"Just plain stupid: Allthough the general concept could be OK, this book wis both generally stupid and was written like an eighth grade book report. I could not believe that anyone would even bother to publish it. Stay away. I couldn't even bring my self to finish it. If you are interested in the concept, pick up a copy of Heinleins ""I Will Fear No Evil"", it is better by orders of magnitude.",0
"Pages out of order: The kindle version has a few pages out of order, which is incredibly frustrating. Luckily I have the print version and could figure out what was going on. I informed Amazon about it but don't buy the digital version until it's fixed.",0
"Good concept, weak design.: I like the features of this light - nightlight is a good color and the right brightness, motion sensor is sensitive. The down side: after a week or so one of the 3 LEDs in the flashlight part started to flicker and got very dim. Two weeks later another LED did the same thing, so I am in the process of getting it repaired under warranty, which costs me shipping to them and $5.00 more for them to ship it back. Hope this was an isolated case of a defective unit.",0
Great Product.: This product is sturdy. Excellent organizer and it is pleasing to the eye. I hate clutter and this works well for a neat freak like me.,1
"I'm in the minority: I didn't have to read this book for a course, but I'd heard good things about it. What can I say? I finished it but it wasn't particularly interesting and a week after I finished it I couldn't remember what any of it was about.",0
"Does the job: I just received this electric mixer before the holidays. Used it during holidays and really like the size, weight and speed options. I also like how there is a plastic tie for the cord attached to the cord so you can keep the cord from getting tangeled up. The only reason I didn't give this the highest review is because I've had it for less than a month which isn't long enough to see if it will ""stand the test of time."" Hopefully, it'll continue to be a great work horse for years to come!",1

"Works for days: This device does exactly what you bought it for. To keep wine fresh for up to a week. I am not a wine connoisseur, but I can still tell that the wine is fresh. I will have to try it on a bottle that is over a week old, but it seems to keep the freshness just fine.",1
"it was aight: I saw the bonus features&didn't really get the Hype of this film.Any film with Jennifer Aniston alone means the film is gonna lose some points because you the acting is gonna be kinda weak.i got some things of the film,but on a whole I didn't get what all the Hype was about.it had some funny moments,but it was fairly predictable to me.",0
"Ultimate X-Men!!: This book definitley lives up to it's name as Ultimate. I wish this book would've been around when I first started collecting X-Men. It brings you up to date on characters, teams, villains, continuity, and more. If you're a fan or just starting to collect X-Men this book is a must have!! Great pics, and there's even original artwork created especially for this book!!",1
Highly recommend this set: We bought this set almost 2 years ago. We still love it!!!! You will not be disappointed. High quaility for a reasonable price. I would suggest purchasing the griddle pan. Our set looks and cooks like brand new!!!!!,1
"Very pleased...: The Adobe Photoshop CS2 Visual Encyclopedia is of a great help as a by the mac side reference look around something you forgot or heard about and are not sure how to proceed book. It is visual, for as there are many intelligences, and it goes right to the point. And, as every thing else on life, it does not tell you what the end is going to be.",1
"I'm surprised it didn't go straight to video.: I saw this movie out of sheer curiosity and was devastated. It's a teen slasher that has absolutely no relevance to American Psycho except for a very thin link with Patrick Bateman, which could've EASILY been changed to have this movie stand out as an original slasher rather than a moronic sequel.Besides, American Psycho was made in a way to let people decide on their own if Bateman was a serial killer, or if it was all in his head. This movie completely rules out the possibility, and if at all taken seriously by anyone, makes it's predecessor lose much of it's essence and uniqueness.The only thing that could've saved this movie was Mila Kunis briefly flashing... but i guess they felt they had already hit rock bottom.",0
"crappy quality don't waste your time: the people who gave this a good review must work for the seller. these are junk, they would not hold any sunglasses (plastic sunglasses) right from the get go. go to Wal-mart and buy two really good ones for $4.99 like I did.",0
Not as funny as the first film: This film was a little disappointing. There was less humor and more attempts at simple shock value that seemed to mostly entertain the people making the film. Please don't make a third film.,0
"Completely agree with editorial review: The only part of this video I find useful is the ab work, and I tend to slow it down a bit, not relying on momentum to do the work. I also use the standing arm work (as opposed to the floor work) and slow the reps to how ever many I can do in the amount of time for each set. She moves way too fast and her form is awful. She also has an erratic pace, getting faster and faster and then seeming to slow down as she gets tired. I wouldn't recommend this tape.",0
"Very interesting and useful: I will not subscribe to everything from this book, but there is a wealth of information, and much of it has been very useful to me.",1
"Looking for a replacement: I bought this pan after reading some good reviews for an everyday pan. I got it home and made some hashbrowns. The hashbrowns stuck after the first 2 minutes of cooking and I used PLENTY of oil but I guess not enough. I had to take them out and use our old pan. You have to use too much oil in this pan to make things not stick and I don't won't to use all m y olive oil to do that. I do like the size and the weight and use it when I'm going to use water for the dish. I wouldn't dare make eggs, brown meat, because of the sticking. Also after cleaning this pan, it lost a lot of the coating.I would have returned this item but I threw away the darn boxEdit: Have used it for awhile and I'm starting to like it. I think it's ""seasoned"" now and Haven't had a lot of sticking!",0
"Please look past the cheesy cover!: This book is great! It is difficult to describe what its about without giving anything away, but I think some other reviews summed it up well. Know that the first half of the book is very different from the second half, so you are not jared when you get to it. It saddens me that Amazon does not have it in stock, but trust me when I say it is worth buying even from an unknown distributer. Like my title says, ignore the cover picture. The book has a completely different worth then what comes across in that picture. It is full of real emotion, adventure, and - to a degree - mystery. And like any good science fiction/fantasy book, it is timeless, so don't think it is too dated to be worth a read!",1
terrible message: I am such a huge fan of these books and movies but i tossed this one in the trash! it has the worst message ever. rather than talking about how healthy food gives you more energy and to enjoy everything in moderation it taks about the cubs being fat and that is the reason they should eat better. So far this is the only bear book i have absolutely hated. total disappointment.,0
"FINGERNAILS ON A CHALKBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have to agree with Paintball. I used to like V.C. Andrews' novels, but since Andrews' death and the assumption of her role by ghost-writers, there has been a steady decline in the quality of her novels, they have become more and more soap-opera-like, more trashy and whining. It makes me want to scream, it really does. Perhaps these novels should be geared towards a Junior-High age group; maybe I'M reading the wrong material, but I think the best thing to do is let poor V C Andrews rest in peace. PLEASE!",0
"Helpful: I still have the last two chapters to read, but overall, it was very helpful. I feel like a burden has been lifted regarding Halloween and my family. There are several great suggestions to be able to minister on Halloween instead of turning off the lights and hiding ;) The chapter on some of the history of Christian martyrs and the moving of All Saint's Day to Nov. 1st was interesting, I didn't ever really understand where All Saint's Day came from before reading some of it in this book. Overall, it is definately a topic that needs to be covered in prayer and decided by your own family what the Lord wants you to do...and when our hearts want to do what is best in glorifying Him, I don't think it necessarily has to end up looking exactly the same as someone else. That is what I took away from this book.",1
"liked it a lot: owned it for a few month , like it. fast shiping.didnt have any problems with the item or the service.",1
"Worst movie of all time: This had to be the worst movie of all time. It was horribly acted, terribly scripted, insultingly ridiculous, very very cheezy, and had me rolling my eyes the whole time! Don't support this trash!",0
"Gaaaa! An infuriating game!: Playing this game was an exercise in frustration. The camera angles are all lousy and the AI is a joke.EA and their supporters keep talking about the realism in this game. But in a ""real"" game players don't let passes fly right through them, defensmen don't let opposing players camp out in front of the net without checking them somehow, team mates don't stand around just looking at a puck that is inches from their stick, and body checks actually knock players off the puck and break up plays.My point is that the AI is infuriatingly bad, and that makes for extremely frustrating gameplay. Oh yeah, and the Speed Burst doesn't work for a bleep, even in Easy mode.In summary, this is one more Xmas gift I am going to return.",0
Poorly made: Collar was so poorly made I threw it out. The metal used to adjust the sizing was bulky and seemed unsafe.Shame on me for not enlarging the photo and taking a really good look.,0
The Note II taking a chance on love: I love the movie and watch it a couple times a week. The music is fantastic. I have done endless searches to identify the song played during the dance scene with no success. I will continue my search. I actually bought both of these movies and would reccomend them to you.,1
"WWE: No Holds Barred: This is a really good look at the Hulk and Zeus! I have been waiting years for this to come to DVD and now it has. I got the VHS when it first came out and still have it. I am a wrestling buff, starting with the WWF and have watched the Hulk's career. I even have some magazines from the 60's with a young Hulk so this movie was for me. 2 giants in the world of wrestling. If you enjoy WWF, WWE, WWE Nitro, WCW, ECW, etc, you will enjoy this movie.",1
it was OK: I really hate giving anything a 4 out of 5 but this movie wasn't incredible like mallrats or dogma. This movie has some really funny lines and if you don't listen closly you wont like the movie at all.,1
"Great Choice for a First GPS: My work requires extensive travel in the Western USA. I have had 2 other Garmin GPS units (an old StreetPilot and a Nuvi 350). I prefer the Nuvi 200 overall. It is simple but has the features you need in a GPS. While it doesn't have an MP3 player, etc., that isn't what I bought a GPS for anyway. Also does not say the street name but has voice directions. Also, battery seems to last longer than the 350. It also seems to calculate as fast as the 350. Like all Nuvi it is small and easy to take onto an airplane. My opinion is this is a great value, thus the 5 stars.",1
Tekken Tag is cool!: This game has awesome graphics. You can get new fighters by beating the unknown fighter. The best feature of this game is when you play the tag game. This lets you and one of your friends challenge against each other or challenge the computer.,1
"Exceedingly partial report on the Mossadeq era: Kinzer is a journalist in the worst sense of the word: unfortunately, his report is exceedingly one-sided as he relies only on the reports of one or two instensely pro-Mossadeq scholars, completely ignoring other sources and especially Royalist people, some of whom are still alive and could have been reached for comment. Kinzer doesnt even speak Farsi (Persian), and thus did not have any access to authentic Iranian sources, except through his two pro-Mossadeq helpers.This book is actually a tragedy, as the material is very sensetive and it being treated in such a frivolous manner is rather insulting.I would wholeheartedly recommend James Bill's ""The Eagle and the Lion"" instead of this book.",0
Bigger than C-sized cells: The adapters are too big. I also have Sanyo eneloop C-sized adapters and they fit perfectly. These are TOO BIG for C sized cells. I was unable to fit them in any of my devices which use C-sized batteries.,0
Regalo Cot: I was very disappointed with the bed. We ordered the bed for a vacation and unfortunately did not open the package until we arrived at our destination. The bed was broken so we had no bed the first night for my son to sleep in. Not sure if the bed was damaged in shipping or if it was manufactured incorrectly either way we were disappointed.,0
"GOOD DUB: This is a splendid Reggea Dub Cd, Dub means no singing by the artists. This "" no singing "" is not the actual reason for calling these cd's Dub. Dub just means that it is an alternate version of an original song. In the old times though it made the most sense to take the foreground singing or lead singer out so you could enjoy the music by itself. This CD has some of the best Bass lines i've heard in my life. Mixed with all kinds of other sounds it makes this cd a must have.",1
"On Her Way...: The author is on her way, the question is WHEN will she arrive? Hopefully, with diligent work and guidance from someone already making it in the game, her raw talent will be perfected.I loved the sister girl tone the book was written in. It was that appeal that caused me and several other readers I have spoken with to keep reading, rather than tossin' it for kindling in our fireplaces.There are good story lines within the plot, however the tales are spun rather weakly and a few UNrealistic when speaking of a true sistah'!I wish Ms. Sanders well, because, hey she did try!",0
"Pretty sure these reviews are fake...: I am utterly, utterly perplexed. This is in no way a 5-star rated book, and I am pretty convinced most of these reviews are fake, and Amazon should definitely investigate it.I could not even finish this book - I'm about 23% of the way in, and I simply can't get into it. The editing is dreadful, and the writing style seems very simplistic. I believe it would be a good effort for an amateur writer, but it is not particularly professional.The characters are very one-dimensional and the scenes seem forced.This is the first review that I have actually taken the time to write - My reason for doing so is that I hate the idea of other people buying this book for the same reasons I did (the wonderful reviews!).",0
"movie download porblems: lets u film movies in HD mode one problem is the movie uses 700GB thats bigger then a dvd for less then 20 minutes worth lenth . I wanted to save theese to cd - r rom but the movie I made with the camera where too big just the same size as a hollywood dvd . the other problem was Downloading the movie to my pc after dueing so the movie kept freezing up on my pc when playing.

"Faded Really Fast In The Sun: This product faded in no time. I wouldn't buy it again. I'd rather spend a few bucks more and get one that doesn't fade. I bought a more expensive one from PetSaver911.com and it works well, is made of static cling just like this one and it doesn't fade.",0
"FORGET METHA, THIS HERE IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE BEST MAHLER 2ND: This recording of Mahler's 2nd symphony is probably the greatest of it's kind in my opinion. Even the legendary Metha recording with the VPO doesn't even come close compared to Sir Georg Solti and the almighty Chicago Symphony Orchestra. And I also have to agree with other reviewers that Solti's ability to make the CSO play at a much more exiting pace make this recording such a gem.If you are a fan of classical music in general then I strongly recommend you purchase the Solti version of Mahler's ""Resurrection"" Symphony. You will not at all be disappointed",1
great rap collection: features nwa and everythiing they have done since. a great collection but i wanna hear more.,1
"A huge disappointment, not well-researched or thought out: This alleged ""history"" of SI is ill-conceived and poorly executed. The author's reportage is extremely sloppy - he gets names wrong, dates wrong, even quotes wrong - and his analysis borders on the dim-witted. This is really The Gospel According to Dan Jenkins, without Jenkins' wit or style. What a bore!",0
"Not as durable, but effective: This fan is very effective, despite some negative reviews. My laptop tends to overheat to the point you can cook an egg on it. I normally clean the fan with a can of compressed air every couple days of usage, but it still had the habit of overheating still.I got this fan from Office Max a few days ago and tried it out. Note that this is the second cooling pad I've owned after the Gearhead brand. This thing is much quieter than the dual-fan of Gearhead's, and isn't as loud as I thought it would be.Although not as durable as others, I still like the simplistic design and the tuck-away USB style.5-star!",1
"Great Christian Rock!!: This really is THE best Christian hard rock album I have ever heard, and one of the best hard rock albums in a long time!! (Yes, better than Kutless, Decypher Down, Skillet, in my opinion). Not too hard, not to ambiguous, and mostly inspiring. All of the songs have great music and lyrics. Although they do not always mention Jesus, most of the songs are also more clearly Christian than most other hard rock Christian bands I have heard. I would highly recommend this album to anyone interested in hard rock music.",1
"The little frothing pitcher that...couldn't: In my opinion, this 12oz pitcher is just too small if you want a decent amount of froth. I can use 1/4c of milk in it and have to do this twice to get my drink exactly how I like it. If I could do it over again, I would go for the 20oz. For now, I will continue using it but once I get a larger one, this little guy will spend the rest of its days in the bathtub for my kids to play with while soaking.",0
"I LOVE SOME HEARTS!!!!: ITS SO BEAUTIUFULLL. MY FAVORITE SONG IS SOME HEARTS, it makes me dance so much in front of my friends. I look really dumb but I guess thats my problem, who cares? Anyway, but this its really awesome!!",0
"DISSAPPOINTED IN ONE SONG: WHY DID TWISTA AND LUDACRIS USE THEIR VERSES FROM THE ""POPPIN TAGS REMIX"" AND MAKE A SONG. TWISTA DID AN EXTRA VERSE BUT THAT WAS AFTER HE RAPPED AN OLD VERSE ALREADY AND LUDACRIS COMPLETELY RE-RAPPED HIS VERSE. IT'S NUMBER 11 ""HIGHER"" IS THE NAME OF THE SONG. I STILL LIKE THE SONG I'M JUST DISAPPOINED IN THEIR RE-USING OF OLD VERSES",1
"Simply Amazing: I had been using a simple 3 piece setup for years, but I decided to step up a notch and purchase some new speakers to feed my growing mp3 cravings. I was AMAZED. These speakers are stunning, the completely blew me away. The sound is great, the remote is great, the loudness is great. My neighbors begin complaining when I hit the second LED (our houses aren't connected at all either).",1

Not any better then the multi surface cleaner: Plus I don't like the scent as much. I don't get any of my cleaning products on Amazon. Why use something less versatile when it's specialty isn't any stronger then the more versatile one? Too expensive to buy on Amazon.,0
"the MBM nadir: an unfortunate byproduct of touring with consolidated, jack got political on this one. too bad. the humor became smug, the grooves fascistly uniform, and musical depth and creativity secondary to ""the message."" a brainless effort that could be exchanged for any number of turn-of-the-decade poofy electro-marxist outfits. and the saddest thing is that his bumber-sticker issues weren't worth the sacrifice. he says nothing new and doesn't even come up with a new way to present the old.i totally agree with the reviewer who encouraged folks new to mbm to search jack's brilliant earlier or later years (99% & subliminal sandwich). but lordy, don't stop here.in particular, check out storm the studio, a deleriously fun but oft-forgotten early release.",0
"Thirsty to drink in water: This watch, like its Timex predecessor, succumbed to water infiltration. I was not snorkeling or scuba diving. The first watch I wore into a shower so it wasn't fully immersed. The other was worn into a lake for a quick swim while camping. Neither lasted a year.The band provides great ventilation and a cool look on the wrist. This watch is unfortunately as reliable as the ones they don't keep locked up in a case. I would not buy another Timex.",0

"so far, its been terrific: The aesthetics are the 1st thing I notice with new products. The DiNovo is no exception. The build quality is outstanding, the feel of the keys themselves quite solid. and I have had no trouble to date. The connection to the bluetooth hub takes a second or so to connect when the computer boots up-- but so what. Its not a significant issue that should discourage someone from considering this product. The mouse is also terrific- excellent ergonomics/ comfort, plus it has thoughtful and well located button features. If any technical failures happen Ill update this post- but so far its worked flawlessly. certainly makes typing enjoyable- and there is zero timelag with the bluetooth once connected. Its immediately responsive to keyboard input. and no messy wires running across my desk!",1
"Worth Buying, But Wont Last Forever: This configuration is definitely an improvement over the original controller. You're thumbs wont have to streatch for those white and black buttons. Also, they buttons are flat instead of rounded, so you wont start hurting after punching them hard after a while like the old ones. The only thing that sucks about these is the joysticks are made of hard, sharp-edged pieces under a thin rubber cover, whereas the old ones used one round plastic piece. What happens is that, after you've been pushing the joysticks back and forth for a while, the sharp under piece cuts through the rubber (I hate it when I tear my rubbers) and starts cutting into your thumb. It should last you about 6 months to a year before they tear apart.",1

"The hair wins: Aside from the fact that this tickles my nose mercilessly, it's ineffective. I'll select one hair to go after and then settle in for the contest. Who will win? Will the hair be able to defeat the whirring Conair Trimmer monster? Get some popcorn and watch! Don't worry--you'll have time to eat that popcorn. Most times the trimmer comes in contact with the hair, the hair cleverly just bends out of the way. It may take a dozen attempts before the trimmer finally chops the hair off. Then we can start a new battle over the next hair. Usually several hairs escape demise as their owner has a bus to catch.I'm inclined to try one of the trimmers with a cylindrical rotating tip rather than this one that works like microscopic hedge trimmers. Hmm. Now that I think about it, maybe I'll try the hedge trimmer!",0

These do NOT work!: I have never written a review for anything but I hated these soooooooo much that I felt it was imperative I review them. I have always used the Clear Blue Easy Digital ones or the cheap little strips but the store I went to was out of Clear Blue Easy so I grabbed a box of these First Response ones. I have never gotten a positive but know based on my cervical mucus and basal body temperature that I did ovulate. So now I'm super upset because my husband and I missed an opportunity to get pregnant this cycle since I didn't know until after I ovulated that I had done so (BBT doesn't tell you until after you have) since these tests didn't work. Don't waste your money...buy the Clear Blue Easy Digital ones!!!,0
"Made her poop soft: I was previously feeding Purina Pro to my Siberian Husky puppy, which was fine and she had no problems with it, but I really wanted to feed her something more high grade so I asked the Petsmart employee what he recommended. He highly suggested the Blue Buffalo brand which I looked into. The ingredients seem legit because there's a lot of healthy stuff in it, but perhaps it's too much carbs or fiber because it made my puppies stool super soft, mushy, and smelly. I read a great article about how to find the best dog food for your pup - [...]. I think I'm going to try Innova or Canidae next. Crossing fingers that it will fare better than Blue Buffalo!! I probably won't be purchasing anymore dog food from Petsmart from here on out.",0

"Styx/Reo Speedwagon..Still the best.: I was lucky enough to be at the Arch Allies show when it was taped. If you want to see two bands that truly enjoy what they do, then buy this dvd. Styx plays their hits and throws in some of their songs from the Brave New World cd, and even with the replacements, Gowen and Sucherman, they are still Styx. I didn't miss DDY at all. And with Glen Burtnik back with the band, it makes the show that much better. Another bonus is Chuck came to St. Louis to perform with the band. Reo Speedwagon keeps getting better every time I see them. Kevin Cronin still has the pipes to bring you back in time when Can't Fight This Feeling and other songs were on the radio. You can tell that Reo is humbled and proud to still be playing in front of thousands of old and new fans. The jam at the end with both bands is great. Being there and seeing it live was the coolest thing I ever saw. Get a piece of rock history and buy this dvd.",1
"Fast paced and witty!: ""Bait and Switch"" is the latest effort by Andrew McAleer and it is a lot of fun. James and Sophia have a banter going on between them that will remind you of the style Columbo uses. They appear more caught up in their own issues but all the while are gethering essential information to help them solve the mystery at hand.In this story there is a case of insurance fraud that ultimately leads to James and Sophia coming across a murder. Andrew does a great job in developing loads of characters along the way to add color and contribute to the mystery getting solved.I suggest this book highly. You will read it quickly and want to read more by the author!",1
"Wow: I've been reading post-apocalyptic books since I was 15 and discovered On the Beach and Alas, Babylon at the local (tiny) library. Very few have lived up to the bar set by these two.Triumph is right up there with them. I can't say that I liked the characters, but the description of the destruction wrought by nuclear war is incredibly detailed, descriptions that are generally glossed over in most post-apoc books. I appreciate that the ""process"" is included along with the interactions of the people left in the shelter after the end of civilization as we know it.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is into EOTWAWKI themes. It's going to take a pretty damn good writer to surpass this one.",1
"Flaky touchscreen digitizer detracts: For the first 10 months of owning my T|X, I thought it was the greatest ever - a 5 out of 5. I suspect many of the good reviews were written by people who hadn't owned theirs long.At month 10, my touchscreen digitizer started losing its calibration more and more frequently. I sent it in to Palm for repair (and their customer service isn't very easy or fast) and received a rebuilt unit. That one lasted about 4 months (just beyond the warranty) and its digitizer started flaking out.Today I can't write anything, and I refuse to pay Palm to fix it and get another dud.Too bad - I've loved Palm for years, but they lost me on a bad product.",0

"Zombie is what the reader becomes: This book is CRAP. WOODEN characters. NOT the mind of a serial killer but the ramblings of a BAD writer. So much is lacking from regarding research, insight, style, writing, consistency that it's not even worth mentioning. Dutton got ROYALLY snookered on this one. Joyce can write two novels a year, but if they are this bad, she should be writing TEN novels a year. DON'T bother.",0
"Bold: This is the best Star Trek movie I've seen in a long time. The actors stayed true to the roots of the original characters while still adding some new twists. The screenwriters/director deserve major props for re-booting this franchise.The plot keeps moving along and you're not bored for an instant. Plus, the original Spock makes a cameo. I think Trek and non-Trek fans will enjoy this simply because it's an entertaining movie. I hope they make another.",1
"THIS ITEM IS NOT BLACK: This item appears solid black in the pictures, but is in fact purple and green striped.

"Not what I thought they were!: I guess I should have read the printed description better. When I saw these on Amazon they appeared to be more of a splash cover for the Kitchenaid stand mixer bowls, the image appeared to have a hole in the center, thus I thought it would be like the bowl cover for my hand mixer bowl I ordered through the Pampered Chef. I thought the lid could be placed on the bowl and the beater could go through the center hole and thus prevent splashing. No such luck, no hole in the middle and even if I adapted it and cut the plastic away from the indented center, the blade would not turn as it should. So now I have lids to put on the bowl to keep dirt and dust out!",0
"CCNA by Todd Lammle helped me excel.: I read this book twice and it helped me pass the CCNA exam on May 2, 2000.

"Very informative: If you box, or even plan on boxing, I suggest that you read this book. It will let you know all the dirty tricks used in the ring. I think you need this knowledge in order for you to compete without getting suckerd. Face it, there are alot of dirty boxers that will do anything to win. You must be prepared for the worst. The only downside is that you need to know the basics of boxing in order to apply the techniques suggested in this book. CHECK IT OUT.",1

"GET A GRIP PEOPLE: The book is not a bible it is a BOOK!If you don't like it~ DON'T USE IT! But for goodness sake, let's not condemn it for EVERYONE!We used the principles of this book after our first child was born. Contrary to what we learned from several lactation ""extremists"" here in the Seattle area, our son was not hungry every time he cried.He almost immediately went to the routine that is suggested in the book, and NO, he did not CRY, ALONE IN HIS BED, WIMPERING FOR FOOD THAT WAS BEING WITHHELD BY HIS MEAN PARENTS! We just tried to entertain him for a few extra minutes over a couple of days to stretch out the time between feedings~ He then ate a little more, and was happier longer!Far from failing to thrive he was a very happy and content baby.If you want to give the scheduling idea a try, DO IT! Don't let the naysayers get you down.And if you DON'T want to do the scheduling thing, THEN DON'T...Go buy a SEARS AND SEARS book instead and let me raise my kids my way too!",1
"Virtual hot pincers speak volumes: It seems only to have occurred to a few of these reviewers that whatever Foucault intended as the poltical upshot of Discipline and Punish (and are we even 'allowed' to ask such a question?) its practical political effect has been to allow senior academics a face-saving way to warn graduate students not to rock the boat while denying any authoritarian tendencies. Perhpas Foucault's work has somehow had more positive political effects in gay rights work, and I would be interested in hearing that argument, but I doubt it. I think his celebrity has done that.",0
"A Great Live Band: Steeleye Span is & has been a great live band but you couln't quite tell so by their live recordings. Gone To Australia is another good but flawed live album. Like Tonight's The Night, Live at Last & the Journey there is great material but the emphasis seems to be on slower songs. This CD is worth having, but probably not as an introduction. To personally solve the problem I just made a compillation disk of the live material & got one great car CD.",1

"This game rocks.: They kept the basic game play the same. Same running over people, shooting whoever, and avoiding cops, but they added a new twist. The cops are better. As you progress up the cop levels they send some harder and cooler stuff at you (i.e. the army).",1
"Very poorly pieced together: I went back and forth quite a bit about whether or not to give this one 2 or 3 stars, but after running through it again I decided I had to go with the lower. There is a bit of good information here, but it is overshadowed by the choppy editing job and the writer's less than satisfactory grasp of the English language. The film goes off on many short tangents as well that add nothing to the story, a whole lot of speculation is presented as absolute fact, and quite a bit of information that is used is just flat out wrong. If you are dead set on watching a documentary about Belle this is just about your only choice, but there are plenty much better documentaries about similar subjects available if you are just looking for 19th or early 20th century murders.",0
"disappointing: What did I miss? The stellar reviews surprised me as I found the book to be tedious and without a spark of realism, (except for the historical abstracts which were the best part of the book and for which I gave the book 2 stars instead of the 1 star the fictional part deserved). Too many coincidences, two dimensional characters, disagreeable Adair, delusional major (what does he see in the mercurial Adair?) and dull dialogue disappointed me. It all adds up to a big D if I were grading it in school. The subject,Southern women's fate in the war zone during the Civil War, is a good one. Too bad the execution does not live up to its promise. The author does merit my thanks for including the historical notes which I shall re-read instead of finishing the book.",0

"Not worth the time: I am amazed that Frank is still alive after suffering through all of the consequences of extreme poverty -- but he definitely takes the easy road at the end of the book. I got so sick of hearing about his self-indulging habits. I don't care if this is an integral part of the male species, I don't want to hear about it over and over again -- that's not why I started reading the book. How did this poverty affect the rest of his life? How did this poverty affect his family relationships later in life? I hoped there was so much more to this story but I was very disappointed. I can't believe that this won a Pulitzer Price. It just goes to shows how the standards have changed.",0

"Released in U.S by Tartan: This Korean horror film was released in the U.S by Tartan Video Oct. 24, 2006. It is seemingly based on an old story about possesed red shoes that dance their victim to death. This one has a ghost twist and some other complications. Overall the movie is over the top (the shoes have a scary theme song) and it is an open ended movie. Rent first!!Storyline cut and pasted from that release:After catching her husband cheating with another woman, Sun Jae takes her young daughter and moves into a dilapidated old apartment building to start a new life. Heading home from work one day, Sun Jae finds a strange pair of high-heeled red shoes located inside her subway car, and decides to take them with her. Unfortunately, these shoes are cursed and cause unspeakable repercussions for those foolish enough to try them on.",0

"Five-star movie, one-star ""Special Edition"" DVD: Commercials on DVDs are nothing new. Annoying though they are, you can always skip them with a click of the remote, right? Not anymore. For Babe, a title targeted at kids no less, Universal saw fit to make the commercials non-skippable. They start as soon as you put the disc in, and the ""Forward"" button on your DVD player won't let you bypass them. The ""Menu"" button has no effect either. Even the ""Stop"" button won't work! Once the commercials start -- including one for the dreadful Cat In The Hat that's nails-on-chalkboard offensive -- there's no escape from them! Shame on Universal for ruining the long-awaited widescreen debut of this wonderful film. My solution: I will no longer buy Universal DVDs until they discontinue this practice.",0

Sufficient: I have searched for suede shoes of this design for the longest time since the pair made by route 66 I acquired from Kmart wore out. The gray beneath is a bit darker that the picture led me to believe and they appear a little more like platform boots than regular suede shoes and I do wish the fabric around the ankle was as thin as the one I had before. It is still a nice pair of shoes regardless and I am satisfied with the purchase.,1

"Please Look At Other Wireless Adapters: I have had this adapter for about a year now and this has given me a major headache. When I first got this adapter it worked just fine, I can surf the net and download files in an instant then about 2 months later the problems began. I first noticed that it took hours to load my home screen of my operating system account. It usually takes about fifteen to twenty minutes to load my background and programs. then once it connects to my router it takes another twenty five to thirty minutes to connect to the internet. I have also faced the same problems with the adapter dropping the connection when I am connected to the net. In summary, this is one of the worst wireless adapters available in the market today. Please, I encourage you to look at other alternatives for wireless adapters. This one is not worth your money.",0
Loud: Just recieved my fan today. The guard is a bit of a pain to assemble due to it being warped. It still doesent mate up on some areas of the fan. My biggest complaint is the noise. At the lowest setting it will knock papers off a table 20 feet away and is loud enough where you have to turn tv etc.. up to hear over the noise of this fan. I don't know why they can't make a fan where low is actually low.,0
"Give your child a great start to reading & writing!: As a an elementary school teacher, I know that kids definitely need literacy activities at home. As a mom, I also know that it's hard to fit everything that kids need into the day! That's why 1-2-3 Reading & Writing is so great! It has fabulous activities that you can easily do at home with your pre-school child to give him/her early experiences with reading & writing. It's very simple to follow, and you can use things you already have around the home for these great hands-on activities. For example, some of the activities use soap, golf-tees, tongue depressors, old magazines, buttons, and even snacks to teach your child beginning problem solving, eye-hand coordination, alphabet learning, etc. Most of the activities don't take a lot of prep-time, which is perfect for busy moms! This has great helps for making learning FUN! Isn't that how it should be anyway?",1
"Be careful with the statistical inferences.: The book does a good job in taking a risk perspective in decision making with options trading. I like the way the author takes a trader's perspective. However the are errors that will mislead a novice who wants to use the statistical thought process. Most notably, on page 58, he states ""One character of standard deviations is that they are additive"" which is fundamentally incorrect. In his example, a one standard deviation (""sd"") of 3 from a mean of 7.5 would give a range of $7.5 +/- $6 for two standard deviations ( a 95% probability). This is incorrect. The 3 sd needs to be squared, doubled then square rooted again to arrive at a two standard deviation of 4.24 (not 6). Therefore, the stock will range from 11.74 to 3.25 with 95% certainty NOT 15.5 to 1.5, as inferred by the author.Please be careful as I have found others.Frank.",0

"Incipio's Handspring Treo Case - Don't bother: This is a very poor design. It will probably be fine if it were larger, it is a struggle getting the Treo out. The side rocker switch was pushing too tightly against the case and constantly leave the unit turned on. I tried to expand the case by stuffing items in it but it was of little use. My recommendation is that you DON'T BUY THIS CASE.I found the case from Belkin to be better, my Treo glides in and out. I recommend BELKIN.",0
"One of the Best TV Shows On The Air: I bought this because I had a few of the season 2 episodes but not all. So the DVD casing has come apart, which means that I can't properly close the DVD case. Something I'm frustrated about, and am not willing to spend an outrageous amount to have fixed, its to small of an issue to be fixed. This is something minor, but I keep good care of my DVD's so the fact that how they were handled in the mail means that they are broken in minor areas which is something I couldn't control is something I don't like. I like things to look asethically pleasing so the fact that the plastic casing has come apart, and that the closure of the DVD is broken so it doesn't automatically closes erks me. Lesson learned.",0
"Warning: Steer Clear of This Product!: This machine appears to be a good deal, but it is not. When I got mine, the remote did not work. It was a hassle to contact the manufacturer for a new one--I had to send the defective one to the manufacturer, at my own expense, in order to get a replacement.After having a defective remote, the unit itself stopped working within eight months of very light use. I was halfway through a DVD when the player just flipped out. It would not read the disc, the picture rolled, the color switched back and forth between color and B&W, and the words ""Bad Disc"" appeared on the screen. The disc was brand spanking new, and after playing it in two other DVD players since this fiasco, I know it is not defective whatsoever. I am lucky this junkie Cyber Home DVD player did not ruin it!It may have nice features and may be compact and cheap, but this unit is a lemon. Do yourself a favor and buy a better product--one that will actually last!",0

"Awesome Church, Awesome book: Yes, I am a member of Southeast Christian....butI WANTED to read this book to have a better understanding of how my church got to be what it is today. I had a hard time putting this book down. I have shared it with people in other cities...and told them what an inspiring book this is. Bob is truly a man of God...his writing supports his sincerity and devotion to his ministry. This was enjoyable, and convicting...highly recommended to anyone interested in 'behind the scenes' of an awesome church.",1
Good book: Story is in the same line as the previous books. A little short on length but consistent with the other titles.,1
Bella Bello: Great product. The hardest thing about assembling this item is the unpacking and that was very easy. All the hardware plus comes with this product to insure immediate assembly and mounting of the different size flat panel TVs as advertised. My only criticism is the lack of cover to hide all the equipment cables and surge protector that end up on the floor behind the unit. A little more thought in design would have made this unit perfect. Looks great and the shinny piano finish (high gloss black) gives this beautifully designed piece the look that it deserves.,1
"It hasn't failed me yet: I was worried after reading some of the other reviews, but I took a leap and am pleased so far. It is almost perfect for the Macmini except it would be nice if it had a lip so the computer wouldn't slide around on it. When I plug something in to the ports on the front of the hub I have to hold the top of the computer to prevent the whole thing from moving because it is light weight. Sometimes the computer slides a little on the hub when I do this. It only takes a second to realign it. The only operational error I have encountered is when plugging my thumb drive in the front port it sometimes does not read it and so I have to plug it in the back. Other devices work fine when I plug them in there so it might be operator error when I unplugged it once.",1

"WTF? MOTP (a better book) has 224 pages, this has 192. What gives?: It's newer and 3.5 i guess. A ""player's handbook to the planes"". Lame. If WOTC are going to rape the collectors and completests, why not give 'em more bang, more quality and more quantity. Merge the MOTP with this book, give us 450 pages and charge the same price. The 2004 ""Expanded Psionics"" book gave you +64 pages (224 total) over the 2001 ""Psionics Handbook"". It's rape, but at least they gave you more. In April 2006 they're coming out with yet another Psionics book with only 160 pages (with the most poorly named title ever) called ""Complete Psionic"" -- which is meant to ""complement"" the Psionics Handbook. Well, if it's meant to ""COMPLEMENT"" the other friggin' book it's harldy ""COMPLETE"" now is it!!!",0

She uses her eyes to track them well!My only complaint is that the additional features (mobile, light, music) only play for 7 minutes before they turn off automatically! This can be very frustrating when you are trying to wash dishes or fix dinner and you have to wash/dry hands to go over and restart these features! I don't know why Fisher Price didn't put an adjustable timer for these features! But, now that the batteries are starting to wear out (it has taken 3 months for this to happen!!), the mobile seems to be ""malfunctioning"" and it spins non-stop! Woo-hoo! I love it! Hate the thought of having to replace the batteries now!",1
Very disappointed.: Hollywood Fashion Tape Hollywood CoverupsI was very disappointd . They would not stick well atall. I had three sets & none of them worked. This was $45.00 wasted.I should rturned them after the first set did not work. I would not recommend them.,0
Great product: I love this nursing cover. I tried another one without the wire support around the neck area and found it very cumbersome and frustrating. This one provides ample coverage and is easy to put on. I often use it at home when I have guests over so I can nurse and still be a part of the conversation. I also love the stylish prints that are available.,1
"Not for the Graphically Oriented: I bought the book based on the one review which gave it raving reviews. Unfortunately if you are graphically oriented like most designers, then this is not for you. If you like to read how to do stuff, then I guess it's fine. Also be advised the few graphics in the book are all MS Windows palettes which may irk Macintosh users.",0
a good book: This book itemizes the related theorems and covers most major results. It would be better if some definitions have some more detailed examples.,1
"Umm.: I pretty sure there's only one good moment in this film, and it's with ""the guy from the bag."" I bought this movie just for that. Overall, its definitely one of those late night, I need to get to sleep, but would like to watch something as my mind drones on, kind of films. Don't buy it unless, like me, you REALL REALLY REALLY want it, just to watch that part over and over. lmao :)",0
"Not thrilled.: Me Against the Music and Toxic are pretty good, but the rest of the CD isn't very thrilling at all. It seems very overproduced and does not seem like much thought was put into the composition. My suggestion is to download the two singles off of itunes and forget the rest.",0
SHEENA'S REVIEW: THIS RICE COOKER IS AMAZING ITS SO HUGE I DIDNT KNOW IT WAS THIS BIG BUT IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY GATHERING OR REUNION THATS HOW BIG IT IS AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING,1
"reviews from ""Gramophone"" and ""American Record Guide"": &#65279;1. Review by Timothy Lovelace, American Record Guide, March-April 1997""This disc is notable for the gorgeous voice of Marjorie Patterson and the charming songs of the young Spohr...Patterson is an impressive advocate. She varies strophes imaginatively, her diction is clear, and her voice is opulent...I recommend this release to all singers looking for neglected gems.""2. Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997""With one of Goethe's most famous lyrics, Mignon's ""Kennst du das Land"", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf's great song was hardly at Spohr's command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency. Marjorie Patterson and Daniel Sarge perform it with the conviction it deserves; they are an excellent Lieder duo, with the intelligence to sense the expressive weightof each song.""",1
"Bad Disk: My disk worked about two times before hanging up. Despite repeated calls to their tech support line and spending several hours on the phone, I've not been able to use it. It may be a great product but I can't get to it.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!",0
"Great game!: I have a Sony dru720a dvd rw /xp and this program loaded with little problems. Ths shortcut provided to start the game doesn't work, but there is another one in the program files under Splinter Cell which works every time.Yes this is a linear game but it is very well done and plays through with little frustration and tons of enjoyment. I really didn't expect to much from this title but was pleasantly suprised.Other than the installation hassle, this is a 5 star game",1

"okay i bought it: This one's a grip. It's still watching kids dance but this ones has hundreds of kids rockin on. It's rebellious in a way but who wasn't ? This one has a high quality casing. This is something dancers, djs and producers wanted. This one's way long too, so you get the footage you deserve. International Style Hip Hoppin'. Still questionable though why people act the way they do in it.",1

The ""locking"" cash drawer will not close at all when the change is inside and it is difficult to open when it is closed. I would not recommend this toy. I am considering returning it for a better designed cash register, if I can find one.",0
"Moving portrait of life on The Last Frontier: This is one of the finest books I have read about Alaska. This is a spare, unsentimental portrait of what life in Alaska is really like--both beautiful and harsh. This is not a book that romanticizes homesteading or the poverty of these homesteaders' lives; instead they come alive through the Brice's crystaline prose and her use of defining detail. Here is real life--people struggling to make lives for themselves in a country that is neither easy nor forgiving. The stark, black and white photographs that accompany the book add a beautiful and moving element. If you want to know what life on the frontier can really be like, read this book.",1
"Very Disappointed with this Book: I bought this book after having read and re-read all the Herriot books for the past twenty years. I was eagerly looking forward to seeing pictures of a young James Herriot, a young 'Siegfried' et al. We fans already knew that the characters names were pseudonyms but did Lord really have to go to so many lengths in almost calling James Herriot a liar ? Why did he feel it so important to reveal so much ? I felt he and Eddie Straiton collaborated in trying to destroy what James Herriot had spent so many years building - a little corner of the world where we can all escape to in our hearts and minds. I wonder how many people will ever be able to enjoy re-reading James Herriots books again after reading this unnecessary 'expose'. Shame on you Graham Lord !",0
"Could have been a great book: I am only on chapter 3 and have actually enjoyed the subject up to this point but I don't believe I have ever read a techbook with so many gross mistakes. For example, page 76 states ""ANSI does use a BOM"" when in fact it should have said ""ANSI does not use a BOM"" which is easily concluded from prior text. Also, the very first code example in ADO is horribly written. One gets the impression after awhile that this is the rough first draft of the actual intended book. Wrox doesn't even list this book as one of their products on their website and I have yet to find the public errata website for this book.My criticism notwithstanding, the book could have been a great book had someone taken the time to clean it up. I get the impression someone pushed these poor guys into getting this thing ""on the street"" way before its time.",0
"Some of the Best 70s Songs: If you didn't live in a cave or a commune in the '70s, hopefully you'll listen to this CD and find yourself occasionally saying, ""I remember that song!""

"STU-PID!: I was more concerned with watching the clock and finding out how many more minutes are left to the end of this very trite, predictable and boring short. There's nothing wow, clever, intriguing or earth shattering about this, and no laughs or chuckles for me. So what's the point?",0

"Ideally Paired With ""Die Broke"": Many, many solid financial tips in this well-written,and,sadly ignored book. The author had his own web site for a few years that had great tips not found in the book such as:* gated communities will only keep out the new or amateur burglar* many wealthy individuals will keep expensive jewelry in a safety deposit box rather than at homeGreat book, just remember not to count on the stock market having ten percent average annual gains as Alch mentions here.An ideal companion for this is the book ""Die Broke."" Both will have one thinking outside the ""box"" in regards to their financial future.",1
"Disappointing given it's price: This is not a cheap toy, so I expected more. The words for the songs (ABCs, 123s) are muffled. Also they touted this as having a huge range of sounds when really it feels like only a few. There are 2 'real' songs.. the alphabet and the counting to ten song. The rest are just short words really, like 'Triangle', 'Red', 'Open'. A cheap handheld toy like the Bright Stars Music Player costs less than $8 and has a much better range of songs and sounds.The legs snap on and off easily, which I like, but they aren't sturdy. If your baby can't walk and needs to lean on something to stand, this is not the right toy for your child. It either scoots away and your baby falls, or it threatens to buckle and break.I wish I had made a difference choice.",0
"I threw it away: Well, I really liked it until it quit 8 months into the gig. I actually took it to an Amish repairman who is a genius and he said that it was a safety switch that was sealed so it couldn't be tampered with. So I threw it away. Furious. Will not buy a Sunbeam again. Bought a Black n Decker and I am keeping my fingers crossed. I really like the cord rewind feature.",0

Although this is a wonderful game, it may scare some children. I even jumped out of my seat sometimes! But don't let that stop you from buying this game, The other games are Stay Tuned for Danger, my next fave. Then my least fave is Secrets can Kill, but it's still good.

"GREAT UNAPPRECIATED 70'S ROCK: Douglas Saldana, aka Doug Sahm, is one of the great lost rockers of the 60's and 70's. His music is a lively, driving mix of Tex-Mex, country, blues and straightahead rock and roll. This is an indispensible collection--my only complaint is it doesn't contain any of the band's great Sixties singles like the incredible SHE'S ABOUT A MOVER.",1
"So Long - So Dull. All Most like the War...: Compared to Gettysburg, this movie is a flop. It's long, dull, drawn out, and it is astonishing to me that anyone in the South ever had children if all they ever did (according to this movie's depictations) ever did is snuggle in bed with full nighshirts/gowns on and talk. While I wasn't expecting all out sex, for krimminie's sake, let's see some passion -- even in the acting!This movie could have been half the length and probably have suffered little in the cut. God help us if the third installment is this bad. Forget this dud and watch Gettysburg, instead.",0
Common lost in the woods story: What i thought about this book is really hard to have to write because i really have liked all of the Dean Koontz books i have read. But Darkfall was just like a old movie about a girl thatis young and is lost in the woods all alone. I do think that the book was written well but i think is should of had more twist to it. I also think this is a book for young students that can read at this level and still understand what is going on in the book.,0
"Beautiful and practical: Sharne Algotsson has managed the feat of writing a book that is both a coffee table book, thanks to the beautiful color palettes and G.

"Disappointing: The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy does contain entries of adequate length for such a publication. However, there are lamentable absences (ie: no entry for Derrida). Also, this dictionary does exhibit a strong bias in favour of eastern thought. These factors detract greatly from the quality of this work.",0
"GREAT book for a new Conure owner!: I LOVE this book because most other books on Conures put WAY to much focus on breeding, which is good if you are an avid breeder, but can be a pain if you keep, or want to keep, a Conure as a pet. When I was thinking of getting a Conure, I bought one book, it told me SO little, then I bought another, same stuff said, in a different form, THEN I found this book, and that made me deicide on a Sun Conure, I would recommend it to people who are considering getting a bird the most, it tells you what might happen if you get a Conure, it doesn't try to mask the fact that Conures are VERY high need birds, if there is anything wrong with it is that the author doesn't seem to call a bird a he or a she, its weird, but WHO(???) cares, sometimes when I write I make it them problems, and it is understood, so that didn't bother me, but I had to find at least 1 thing wrong with it, and that was all I could think of!Hope this helps!!!",1
"Sprung a leak at month three: Purchased the bed at the end of may, and it has been used for the last three months as a house guest's primary mattress. Sprung a leak around a week ago. The patch materials they included with it were horrible. The felt like top where the hole appeared would not allow for the patch to seal the hole. The hole itself was right along a seam. Sad that it took so little time for it to begin leaking. Because of that felty top, the bike patches would not work either. Finally, super glue, the original patch, and a lot of duct tape and the leak has slowed to needing to add air every other day.",0
"Reissue is a dissapointment: I like this cd and I do not question the fact that Lenny is a good guy who makes great music. But, reissuing this cd with two new songs is a real rip off to those of us who bought it when it first came out. I am a ""real"" fan who does not appreciate having to buy an album twice to get an artist's songs, particularly one song that has turned out to be a hit single (American Woman.) So are ""real"" fans as one reviewer calls us, supposed to have to buy two copies of this to get these songs. Hey, money may grow on trees in your neighborhood, but it doesn't in mine.",0
A BAD Substitute for Table Mate: I received 2 tables from Wonderful buys.com. They shipped it in the original packaging and it was severely torn and ripped. I also found the product cheaply made. The table part is warped and will not stay flat.These are going back to wonderful buys! Next time I'll buy the brand name Table Mate. The reviews for it seem pretty positive.,0

"Disappointed: I bought this mobile after researching several. I decided to spend the extra money because the reviews for this were very high. I was extremely disappointed with this product, and returned it. If you have a crib with bumpers, this product does not attach well at all because it has to be behind the bumpers or mushes them down. It also falls over very easily by touch, and I did not feel it was safe for my son who moves around a lot in his crib. Finally, the motor is so loud it woke my son up as opposed to helping him fall asleep. The only positive aspect was the music, which was classical and had three selections. This is hard to find in other products. All in all, though, I suggest chosing something else.",0

"Too boring a routine: I generally like Kathy Smith workouts, but this is my least favorite because of the lack of variety in step routine. It truly feels like I'm doing boring, repetitious moves, and I constantly feel the urge to stop. It does work out the lower body well, but it doesn't motivate me much, seeming like more of a chore than a fun routine compared to her other videos.",0
"Nice try.: Ms. Casas seems to have the mistaken idea that all long-grain rice is ""converted"". It's not.Also, I don't believe that a recipe that cooks for 10 minutes in a gas oven would take 20 in an electric, ""even when (the electric is) properly calibrated"". Heat is heat, unless the oven is a convection model. Maybe she ought'a calibrate her GAS oven.THE HERITAGE OF SPANISH COOKING, by Alicia Rios and Lourdes March, tells you how to cook a paella on top of the stove, and by extension, the grill, like they do in Spain and New Orleans.",0
"Very sophisticated kids for 1959: First I read 'Torpedo Junction' a really good non fiction account of the Uboat war along the US coastline. Then I saw the movie October Sky on cable, then I read the Coalwood series. However, before I read the books and as a long time aerospace enthusiest I was somewhat cynical about the stories, but happily, I've mostly been proven wrong except for one small thing. It seems to me like the kids in this book seem a little too 'adult' in their dialogue and thoughts. To me, it reads as more of an idealized reconstruction from an adults perspective. But then again, they were able to figure out on their own how to design and build some pretty sophisticated vehicles, launch systems and fuel. So maybe I'm wrong regarding the thoughts an dialogue? Either way, very enjoyable series of books. Look out, David Poyer, you got some competition!",1
Much said about nothing.: I sat down for a good summer read and felt nothing but pity for most of the characters. I still cannot figure out where the two chapters not written by jane came from and where they planned to go! I kept reading for a reappearance of the characters and a possible tie in. It never happened and made me go back to the beginning to see if I missed something.,0
"Brilliant classic movie by Jonathan Sayles - buy one for your local library: I'm sure there are ample reviews praising this amazing film about the labor wars in the Appalachian mine fields of the early 1920's (staring James Earle Jones, David Strathrairn and a young Chris Cooper). Also see the 1976 (77?) academy award winning documentary ""Harlan County, USA"", about a mine strike in the same area in the 1970s - the Criteria Collection reissue of that has a lot of really wonderful extra material as well. I bought two copies of Matewan and donated one to my local public library - the librarian tells me that the distributors that libraries rely on are no longer carrying Matewan. So, for about $10, I got a factory-sealed copy of the DVD to donate and make available to a new generation. With Netflix cutting back their selection, public libraries are becoming the best place to get DVDs - and its a good idea for progressives to donate great films when not otherwise available to the libraries.",1
"Didn't help me in my situation: I did not notice a very big increase in supply, if at all, while using Fenugreek, even at the max dosage.

"Needs a remastering job!: The music is five star but the audio is taken from vinyl, the main thing missing is bass, it's been rumoured that the master tapes were lost in a fire but there are always sub masters made and usually every country of release will have a different sub master (added EQ, compression or limiting), so we should have a better version one day, if Frank Marino can get back rights from the record label!",0
"How can you retire well as an author?: The best way is to keep your climaxes long and drawn out. Jordan has managed to do this over the last three or four books now, and he shows no sign of lessening the pace. Of course, he does this by stopping all action is his books and splintering the story off into a dozen or so fragments so you have to buy all twenty of his books to get a complete story. He's discovered how to avoid the weakness that develops when you have a set of novels set in a fantasy world:some people can't be bothered to buy all the books---they just buy the ones that interest them. By sticking all his novels together, he can make you shlep through all 7,000 pages or so. Great marketing, anyway.",0
"Sweatsedo ""bait and switch"" advertising: I ordered Sweatsedo's ""Baby Blue Crew Men's Velour Sweatsuit"" based on the photo. What I got is a totally different style warmup suit that is not actually velour at all, but brushed cotton. I might add that the only resemblance between the one I got and the advertised photo, is the color. I will admit that the ad did say, '80% cotton and 20% polyester.' However, the fact remains that it is still deceptive advertisement, ""Bait and Switch."" I didn't feel like the hassle or the headache involved in trying to get it shipped back and maybe getting the same thing again, as I am disabled, which is why I'm even ordering a warmup suit online in the first place. The only reason I give Sweatsedo a 1 star rating is because that was the lowest rating available. As far as I'm concerned this purchase rates even lower than that. I will never shop with them again and I will tell all my newtwork of this experience, as well.",0
"Samsung: Bought this printer a year ago and didn't want to review without some time with use. Print quality is OK. It is not for anyone who would like photo quality prints. It does the job. Slow to start everything-Fax-Print-Sleep. If you want to send a quick fax, you need to be ready to stand at the machine and wait a few seconds to warm up. The ink is expensive as you can imagine on any new machine. Lots of replacement parts-drum, ink waste cartiridge,and ink that they will be happy to sell you for years. It only holds a small stack of blank pages. I'm still waiting for some producer to make something that can do all at a reasonable cost. I'm not sure on the cost per page, but I seem to be buying something for the machine every couple months. I am in my own home office. Hope this is helpful to someone!",0

"A Living History: An excruciatingly accurate portrayal of the fall of Berlin, this is a historical work of uncanny accuracy and quality. Having read Albert Speer's account of the Third Reich, ""The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl"", Stephen Ambrose, John Keegan, Eisenhower, Churchill, Lidell-Hart, and many others, it is readily apparent that ""Downfall"" is the product of meticulous research. At 155 minutes it is a commitment, but surely we can spare the time to look at some of the forces behind the deaths of around fifty to a hundred million people worldwide.",1

"Second best book on Mathematics of Derivatives: Baxter and Rennie did an excellent job in explaining the mathematics behind financial derivatives in a concise way. It's definitely the best book on the subject apart from Neftci's ""An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives"". Baxter and Rennie spend more time on probabilities than Neftci. One word on introductionary books on the mathematics of derivatives. Introductionary is meant for people who have a strong mathematical / quantitative background. For all the others, a book like ""Quantitative Methods in Finance"" might be a better book to start with.",1

"Another Magnificent Album from Laura Smith: I was enthralled, electrified and transfixed when I first heard 'My Bonnie' on Public Radio in Boston. I had to have the Album and traced it to her label in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was more than worth the trouble. There is not a bad track on the album. Laura has a pure voice and her own songs are a wonderful fusion of Jazz, Blues and Folk. Her first Album 'Laura Smith', (1989), is a brilliant debut and the track 'Jordy' presages 'My Bonnie'. Laura's third Album,'its a personal thing, (1997), maintains the high standard. Buy all her CDs, Laura Smith is in the first rank as a singer/songwriter.",1

"Unfunny and Joyless: I remember sitting in a theatre watching GHOSTBUSTERS II, completely surrounded by legions of little kids who only came to life to make the zapping sounds during the special effects sequences. Nobody laughed.Even Bill Murray complained about this movie in an interview, wondering why they bothered. (We would all say it was for the money, of course, but I think I know what Mr. Murray was talking about after sitting through this).The Stay Puft Marshmellow Man attacking NYC in the first film was funny.The Statue of Liberty used to help NYC get its groove back was just lame and silly.",0
"As stunning as the photo!: Rich greens with an inner firey reddish orange and deep gold center. I have had compliments each and every time I wear this stunner. It enhances your outfit nicely.These Swarovski Crystals are fun because they look great with casual, busienss, or more formal cocktail wear.I'm not sure how the clear ones would be, but I've bought 4 of the colored crystal pendents and they have been great weight, the gold-backed have been lovely and rich in color and the one that was a soft blue like blue topaz with jagged edges are all lovely.They look great with the Sparkling Diamond Cut Sterling Silver 1MM Italian Snake Chain necklace they have for sale -- very reasonable and the sparklet compliments the pendents and they glide on easily. I like the 24 inch length which is right at the top of your breast, the 30 inch length would be nice with longer sweaters (I've decided to order that length also.)",1
"The movie does not do the novel justice: This book is a masterpiece of human insanity and the need for control. The character of Alex Cross is an attractive young widower who does not need our sympathy. He has two young children but with the help of his grandmother is doing well as a single father. Then you have Kate an ambitious young medical intern who has bad luck with men. Their characters get thrown together when she is kidnapped by the same ""Casanova"" as his favorite niece. The ""Casanova"" is faceless and Patterson's protrayal of him makes you yearn to remove the masks which hide his face. This novel is full of suspense and mystery. Alex Cross is the investigator we all hope we have if something goes wrong,we all hope to be as strong as Kate Mctiernan, and hope we never encounter Casanova. In all the movie ""Kiss the Girls"" didn't even get close to showing the audience the complexity of the human psyche.",1
"Response to Disappointed: This camcorder is great but I have had similar experiences with Circuit City's customer service. I even paid for the extended warranty for my laptop which they denied to service it. Their pathetic customer service kept me on hold every third minute (Honestly! not a joke) for hours. Being a customer, I invest money to purchase electronics and in return I get insulted like this.

Fiction, yes, but when you read it, you feel that you're honestly getting to know Jesus. The book isn't on my bookshelf now, but in the drawer of my bedside table for the next re-read. I have a Kindle now, and wish so very much that the publisher would make the book available as an e-book.",1
"Great tool: A must have! My son's boss gave him an older 8'' version. He loved this tool. I ordered an 8"" for myself and a 10"" for him, Truly fantastic toll to have available.",1
"still waiting for my soil....: i have my moss ready, my charcoal, my pebbles and plants. but still waiting on the soil. ordered it exactly 7 days ago. if i knew my soil would be bouncing around utah for an entire week, i would have just gotten it at the local plant nursery. supposed to come within the next 2 days. sell waiting.....",0
"It's like an unlimited capacity flash drive...: I love this thing! The Kingston TravelLite feels solidly built and is even smaller than it looks in the pictures. Another thing you can't see in the picture is that it has a clip on the back. It also has a hole for attaching a lanyard or keychain, although it does not come with either. I had no problems reading or writing to a 4GB SD card. The SD card door is attached so it can't get lost. The USB cap is not attached, but I find it convenient to slide it under the clip while the reader is in use to avoid misplacing it. The cap also fits snugly so I don't need to worry about it falling off in my purse.",1
Shaver Battey pack for Norelco shaver: I placed these batteries in the shaver and they would not charge. Therefore I had to through the shaver away.,0
"traveling with englishmen: I am reading this book now and loving it! The relationship between Jones and Muggleton (that slowly falls apart) is one of the most interesting parts of the book. Muggleton is typical of a certain type of Englishman and I am cringing for her as I read some of the paragraphs. Highly recommend this book if you are interested in travel, Africa, adventures, etc.",1
"Does the job: It's really nice to be able to tell how much rain we got. I stuck the gauge into the backyard lawn and it stayed put all fall. Easy to empty. Made of plastic, so it's unlikely to freeze, but I stored it away for winter just to be safe. Good value for the price.",1
"Just a mediocre sci-fi time killer: I, as a Vangelis fan, bought it simply due to some name confusion (The Arrival + Vangelis = completely not relevant CD) and MAINLY the 4 star review at amazon. After watching it I realized this is really just a TV-scale sci-fi movie. Low cost production with one-actor show. The story was barely interesting but the acting, special effect, and script were just mediocre, not really to the standard of big screen.Some claims this is a movie that should receive better review than Independence Day. Not so at all in my opinion. Not even compare with the special effect, just by the ""effort"" put in the movie and the acting alone, ID was way better than this movie. I found Sheen's acting was exaggerating and less convincing.Since I was lured to buy it due to the review, I would just like to provide another data point to help people make better decision than I did. :(",0
"A weak return from the Master: Timothy Zahn's eighth book in the Star Wars expanded universe and, unfortunately, possibly his weakest yet.The story itself reads as though it were written for a very specific group of fans, and is at oft times childish. For the more adult die hard fans of Star Wars the continuity changes will draw frowns, with characters from previous books acting with greater skill than they appear to have later on in life.Though, for these difficulties the simplicity of the story, and the ease of the writing will appeal to younger fans, and those looking for a simple and quick read with nothing challenging. Though these are not the trademarks of the intrigue and atmosphere that Timothy Zahn's other work has.Not great, stormtrooper fans especially will love the Hand of Judgment and this story, so if you are; consider it recommended. But certainly this is not close to his best work, and it simply doesn't feel like it was written for the wider audience.",0
"Dropped to 2 stars after 3 weeks.: I read another review in which the smoker did not find it worked well lighting his cigars, it works just fine on my Arturo Fuentes's. I'd give it 5 stars if it held more fuel.UPDATE: I just updated my review and dropped it from 4 stars to 2. This thing is very hard to adjust to get a flame. Most of the time it doesn't have a flame at all, it just glows orange. I can hold my finger right over the glow and it barely gets warm.It seems that if it is at all cold outside this thing is useless. I was expecting much more quality for the price. Considering returning it before the 30 days expires. Or perhaps I'll just keep sending it to the manufacturer until I get one that works, maybe they'll get the message.",0
I was very disappointed with this one.: Don't buy this product expecting to fully learn the Spanish language. It will teach you a few words and phrases but that's it. It contains nothing about grammar or how to pronounce the letters and one cannot fully understand a language without first learning that. I feel that this CD-ROM was a complete waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to truly learn the Spanish language.,0
"Easier then buying the singles separately: I just got this because where I live they don't sell itIt's a nice item to add to my Eminem collectionI must say the only bad part would have to be:Since it was out in 2003, 2004+2005 tracks were cut offBut hey, It's easier buying those than his WHOLE careerMust-buy-everything fan or not, You should check it out5/5+ stars would be my rating, I enjoyed it alot myselfDon't forget the bonuses, Not just singles:A fold out (smaller) two sided posterEm's version of 50 Cent's ""Wanksta""Enjoy it, There are sellers here who offer nice prices!",1

"What a shame!: I feel compelled to add my voice to those of the reviewers who have already complained about the awfull motion blur which afflicts this bluray...not only in order to (possibly?) call the attention of the producers to this problem but also to raise consciousness in general so that it will be less likely that such shoddy production methods will be perpetuated on future discs. In short, this is a very nice perfomance indeed, but who can really enjoy it if every single movement is blurred beyond recognition!! By the way, I looked at several other ballet blurays for comparison and found none of them to be anywhere near as annoying as this. I would say that the blurring on this disc is at least two or three times as bad as what I saw on others. In fact, it really wasn't an issue on the other blurays.",0
"INFLUENCES-SCHMINFLUENCES - LENNY IS LENNY!: I tire of the ''I-love-Lenny-but-this-record-blows'' reviews I keep reading here at Amazon. This is a GREAT Lenny Kravitz recording. He plays all the parts, yet this rocks like a band. The songs are well developed; ''Stillness of Heart'' is a brilliant pop song. Do you know how difficult it is to write a simple, compelling, hook-laden pop song? Lenny seems to pull them off in his sleep!Another thing that just doesn't ring true anymore is the ''Lenny's nothing but his influences'' hoohah. Lenny is Lenny! His sound is defined and larger than his influences by far.With repeated listenings, the new Lenny is a gem for the ears. Sing-alongs, rockers, ballads, they're all here. If you love Lenny, you'll love this. If you say you love Lenny, and you write a nitwit ''all-the-other-ones-were-great-but-this-one-makes-me-vomit'' review, I'm calling you out. You don't like Lenny at all. Perhaps the predictability of the Backstreet Boys would be more your speed!",1
"Great overview of the Nazi state; very well done.: This series is very good a zeroing in on individual Nazis to show how ordinary people did terrible things within the framework of the larger state. It also does an excellent job of explaining the Nazi world view. It pays well deserved attention to the importance Hitler placed on ""art"" and culture as well as the way in which social Darwinism was twisted into a culture of lawlessness where the strong were encouraged to exploit, if not destroy, the weak.Episode 4, ""The Wild East,"" I found particularly thought provoking. Its portrayal of Gauleiter Arthur Grieser is disturbing and truly ""A warning from history.""I highly recommend this series.",1
"Where's the proof?: The portion of the book dealing with Princess Diana's death is excellent and would hold up in a court of law. The other 90%, however, is based upon speculation, innuendo and an over-reliance on other works that have been written without facts. Even the photo of the bohemian grove ceremony is blurred.",0

"Total Rip-off Without A Doubt: No fault of Amazon but this is a total rip-off by the makers.As many, many have said on lots of reviews across the world, on the net and in other forms of media - WAIT for the fuller versions.For crying out loud, there is LOADS of space for both versions to be incorporated to this Blu-ray disc but no, ""lets rip-off the public as much as we can"" is the attitude of the makers.Its a disgraceful action on behalf of the film company to allow this to be released.Sadly, some will still buy this rip-off - but a true fan will have better sense and wait.AVOID NOW - and get the fuller version later.",0
"Doesn't stick: Both the temporary and the permanent adhesive failed to stick to the dash. I didn't want to use the permanent adhesive.

"Entertaining but beware.: [...]I am a holistic practitioner and deal with addictions.While I was reading the book I thought it was good and it offered some very good advice. Then I discovered the truth: This book is one long advertisement for Passages, the author's insanely expensive addiction treatment program. At $55,000.00 a pop for one month's worth of detox (which is not guaranteed) who can afford this but the rich and privilaged? Any program that cannot serve the masses is not for me. Also, Mr. Prentiss keeps bragging about his success rate. Well, of course. Why else would anyone shell out $55,000.00 a month? I may know why. After paying $55,000.00 who has money to buy drugs?",0

Great buy!: My company purchased this pool to go along with our Customer Service Week theme. I received the pool approx. 1 week before our event. Upon receiving I inflated the pool to make sure it was going to hold the air. The pool sat for 1 week and held the air just fine. No need to re-inflate. I would recommend this item.,1
"Great for the price.: I'm a musician, after my shure e2c's died, I was like crazy looking for other In-ear phones, and I said $25 why not? So I gave them a try and they were quite nice for the price, but with those sleeves that come with them you missed a lot of bass and also there's not too much Isolation. So I grabbed the foam out of the Shure e2c and bang! into these JVC and they rocked.great If yo want to have in-ear for a lower price, but you cannot compare it to the shure one or the ultimate ears one.",1
"J Lo's back with full force with her recent hit!: While it was majorly played out this past spring, I really enjoyed her duet with LL Cool J On ""All I Have."" The chorus is catchy and LL's raps are really good. The production courtesy of Corey Roony is excellent and the sampling of ""Loving Life and Life is Living!"" is really fun to sing along to. Catchy hooks and danceable beats give two thumbs up from me! This is her best collabo since ""Ain't It Funny Remix.""",1

"Sha Sha: Wow, I love this album. I first heard Ben Kweller not too long ago in my sister's car. After hearing ""Wasted and Ready"", I had to listen to more of Ben Kweller. So I borrrowed the album, and I haven't stopped listening to it sinse. This music reminds me of Ben Folds crossed with Weezer (does anyone esle think he sounds like Rivers?) Anyway, I would recommend this album to anyone that enjoys good music. In my opinion, the best tracks are Wasted and Ready, In Other Words, and Falling. Enjoy!",1
"Revised opinion: I had previously reviewed this product and was very unhappy with the cartridge. However, since then I have not had any problems and I am have also installed a second Rhinotek as a replacement and it works fine. I am not sure why I was having problems with the first cartridge, but the problems seemed to resolve themselves and the new cartidge is problem free. Colors are great and no difference in performance than the... Epson products. Had I not had some of type of problem I would now rate this product at 5 stars. I am reserving that extra star to see how their cartridge performs over time. Right now I am very satisfied with it and I would reccommend it - ....",1
"this is just the best: Cathy's manual has been indispensable as our family homeschools for the first year. It's comprehensive reviews have helped us make decisions with confidence, and Cathy is to be especially commended for her gracious, even-handed approach to diverse perspectives (such as Protestant and Catholic views). She has covered not only curricula but all the practicals such as publishers' phone numbers and addresses (post and web), planning, skills, goals, testing, grading, graduating and more. . . . Perhaps most valuable of all is a great introduction (for parents and children alike) to worldviews. Even the paper/print quality here is exceptional. If you have room for only one homeschooling resource, this is just the best.",1
Very disappointed!!!: I never thought that I would every receive something that was in the kind of condition that this product was. As soon as I opened the box I could tell that it was broken. It looked like some one just shoved a screw that didn't even fit into it. One of the straps were broken and the pins on the bottom kept coming out. I would expect this kind of quality from a 0.99 cent store! I will NEVER get something from this company again online!,0
"Beautiful Voice: I heard the title song on the radio when I was living in Italy back in the 90s - The title song, 'Finalmente Tu' (Finally You), track #4, is still, in my opinion, the most romantic and beautifully sung ballad I've ever listened to. Fiorello's smooth baritone and heartfelt delivery makes you understand why native Italian men are synonymous with love and romance.",1

"Its just the end of the world....get a grip: I found the scenario at first fascinating then started to get a little tired of everyone kinda losing it all the time.

Jack was too tortured to ever do anything with out overanalyzing it.....turned the whole end of the world scenario into something personal. Its not that bad....",1
"An out-of-the-way Rossinian rarity in a shining showcase.: It is not William Tell, or the Barber of Seville.The arias come mainly in ensembles (especially for Corodino, the male protagonist).Duets, trios, quartets...and the cast does these well enough.If you have any prick on this recording, well, allow me to say, is that Florez's fluid coloraturas flow too often (as in all Rossini pieces), too lyrically, too successfully. And as if to add to it, Annick Massis also gave a florid display of her coloratura skills. Well, if you are not into this style of bel canto singing, forget it. If you are into it, it is a must to own.If you are hunting for showcase solo arias, there is just one - for Massis. Florez fans may be a bit disappointed here.That said, for this rarely recorded and performed work, this recording will most likely remain the benchmark for many many more years to come!",1

"Absolute rubish: This book is garbage. I debated over rather or not I should even devote any more time to it by writing a review. But let this warn you: if you are thinking of buying this book, DON'T. It is so difficult to read, and the plot is so thin, that it is not worth the time. Not to mention the fact that this is one of the most blatantly racist books....I shiver to think about what would have happened had this piece of junk been written by a white person instead of a black one. There would have cries of racism, the book would have been banned, and the NAACP would have had a field day making themselves the victims. The whole idea makes me sick. Trust me, this book is not worth the paper it is printed on.",0

"Over-hyped, Over-rated and VERY mediocre: Bought these headphones because of the glowing reviews submitted by others, but I have to disagree hartily. The bass is thin and weak, the soundstage distant (as if you're sitting 50 feet away from the sound source), midrange is pleasant but average, highs are ok. For the price of these cans I'm very disappointed and definitly would NOT recommend them. If you dig big low end in your phones, and hunger for FAT lows and smooth midrange, look elsewhere.",0

"Great entertainment!: This was a very enjoyable mini-series. I loved this dark Dickens' story, the characters were varied and interesting. I thought it was well acted and very satisfiying. Gillian Anderson was remarkable in her portrayal of a sad and bored wife, even if some of her mannerisms were a bit phony. All of the female characters were well defined and very realistic For those of you who love all things British and BBC video, ie. you have all of the Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell adaptations, this should be the next one on your list.",1
"GOOD IDEA; BAD MANUFACTURING!: I bought this grill basket for my husband for Father's Day. According to the description, it had everything we were looking for: detachable handle, separate sections for separate cooking, grilled veggies won't fall through, etc. Unfortunately, the basket is so poorly made that the baskets don't open (without a crowbar!) and the handle neither attaches or detatches without a whole lot of muscle. My husband had to get out his tools and try to rebend the whole thing to get it to function. What an over-priced dissappointment!",0

"THIS BOOK IS ON THE THIEVS LIST GET IT IF YOU CAN!: Buy this book if you can. This is the number one book that is stolen from your library in order to suppress the information. Believe me, main stream media does not want this book to be known. Barry Lynes tells all about Royal Rife and the machines he made that were confiscated and destroyed by the Medical Industry (AKA medical mafia) with gestapo like tactics.Come on man this is the twenty-first century ; the future of medicine is electronic frequencies and the future doctors are diagnostic technicians;PLAIN AND SIMPLE. The book cover states FIFTY YEARS OF SUPPRESSION but it was written in 1987 so now it is more like SEVENTY YEARS OF SUPPRESSION. Even Nikola Tesla helped make some of these electronic medical devices which were also confiscated and destroyed. Need I say more ? end of story.",1

"Traumatized My Daughter For Weeks Now: My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to my daughter and her class. It scared my daughter so bad that she cannot sleep at night and has been crying throughout the day for two weeks now. She is totally traumatized. I can't believe that Scholastic would recommend this book for 4 to 8 year olds. The premise of the story is too sophisticated for kids of this age and I am appalled that you recommend it for such ages. I can tell you that we were getting ready to order a bunch of scholastic books through school for our daughter, but after this experience, I will never them you a penny. Thanks for scaring the crap of out of my 5-year old daughter and making my and my wife's life a living hell in the process.",0
"Worse than terrible: I've been a fan of political and military-oriented thrillers for years, and have never read such a poorly written book as this one. Mr. Robinson is totally out of his element writing on the inner workings of the US government and military. However, what he lacks in actual knowledge, he makes up for with terrible writing.The premise of this book is valid, but his execution of the story is laughable. Ironically enough, his characters laugh at almost everything, especially at the wrong time. It's as if Mr. Robinson accidentally set out to write a book for the cricket and tea crowd.It's painfully clear that he did little research to prepare for this novel. The characters are shallow, poorly constructed, or outright unbelievable. Their motivations make no sense. Oh yes, and let's not forget the nonsense ""liberal democrats will destroy everything we know and love"" plot line.Save your money, this book isn't worth the paper it's written on.",0
"Did not live up to the expectations!: I've been a die-hard fan of Griffin's books since the first time I picked up the first ""Presidential Series"" book. Hence I was very eager to get my hands on the latest installment of this series, ""The Hunters"". The book started off at a good pace in Hungary but as it progressed the protagonist got involved in endless discussions with various agencies and the storyline kind of dragged on without much steam. I honestly had trouble reading till the end. I have also started disliking Griffin's idea of removing female characters from the stories abruptly. This time it was with Betty Schneider. She was seldom mentioned during the entire story and at the very end she just ditches Charley!! I've seen similar ending with his other female characters in the other series that he has written (""Men in Blue"").I really hope that he brings in a bit more action in his next installment of the ""Presidential Series"" which is due in January 2008.",0
"Not both seasons of the show: I loved this show, there's no doubt about that...but what I disliked once I found out was that this isn't the entire series, I know it doesn't say that anywhere; but when it says ""Boxset"" that means ""Entire collection"" to me...Truth is it only contains Season 1 Episodes 1-24 + OVAIts a great show that I'd recommend to anyone wanting a romantic mix-up action comedy anime to watch.By the way, there are about 4 special episodes out that weren't on this set, along with a movie.And thats all I have to say.5 out of 5 for the anime4 out of 5 for not stating that it was only the first season...",1
"Good comedy, cool cinematics: The stand-up portion of this DVD was funny, I wouldn't quite rate it 5/5 partially because of a rather unsuspecting use of cursing in contrast with his Comedy Central Presents shows. Still Zach is a very unique comedian that deserves some acclaim. There were also other segments to this DVD that gave it almost a documentary feel, the interview with his twin brother Seth which was hilarious and the road adventures with his friend Joe was also great. Overall I think this is a great product for somebody looking for a breath of fresh air in stand-up, as long as a little bit of cursing doesn't bother you.",1

"It is not very durable...: I did not purchase this through Amazon; it was through Back to Basics Toys. It was a Christmas gift for our 7 year old son. Granted the age on this toy is 5+, but our son is interested in regular pool, so we figured it would be neat to get this so he could get the idea of what it was all about. Yes, it's a fun game...if you can get through it without any pieces falling off and/or breaking! Just received our replacement Skittle Pool in the mail today and, already, it is broken. It truly is a piece of garbage as far as quality goes. It's all plastic...the ""A"" frames (two are included) are warped, making for total inaccuracy when ""shooting"" the cue ball. The plastic piece that sticks up out of the swivel arm (which a stationery cue ball sort of gets inserted on) snapped off ~ one of the reasons we needed a replacement game...and then one snapped off the replacement!! For the price, I would think they could invest a little bit more money and make this game a bit more sturdy.",0

I showed some interest at first but was quickly turned off by the fact the he wrote a song for.. of all shows... ""Dawson's Creek""?!? What's next? ""Friends""?

"my fave book!: This is my favorite book! all the charcters were so well described and defined and they dealt with real issues normal teens deal with. on top of all the that it was pretty funny. its basicly about four best friends who are going to be split up for the first time in their lives for the summer. just so ya know, Bridget is the athlete, tibby is the rebel, lena is the artist, and carmen is the one with the temper. over the summer, bridget goes to an all girls soccer camp and falls for eric, one of the coaches. tibby stays at home with her job at wallmans, but only to meet a girl named baily who teaches her some important lessons. lena goes to greece with her sister. her grandma thinks kostos is a ""nice boy"" but lena twists the truth and creates a huge fight between the two familys. carmen goes to visit her dad, only to find out that he has a brand new life. i luv this book and i think u will too.",1

"A let down: I know many people here enjoyed this movie, but, personally, I found it a let down. After hearing so many good reviews about David Lynch's work, I decided to give the movie a spin.While the music was chilling and well-composed, the cast ""stellar"", and some scenes quite disturbing, the over-all effect was convoluted and confusing. I had trouble following this loopy script, and spent much of the time getting up to refill my Coke cup.If you want something dark and unusual, go with Jean Pierre Jeunet or Terry Gilliam, or even the early Chris Carter. If you want to annoy yourself, go with Lost Highway.Note: on it's own, each aspect of this movie was great. The acting was great, the photography was great and the scary lipsticked dude chilled my blood. Put together, however, only distracted from what could've been a great short story or novella. I think Lynch has a wonderful and fascinating mind, but would probably be better off writing novels over movie scripts.",0
"Boring: I do believe I must stifle a huge yawn before continuing. One moment, please ...There are any number of reviews appearing in any number of magazines about any number of books. One has to wonder why Amazon chose to sell this particular one. Amazon has a responsibility to its customers, I think, to avoid such blatant displays of doing anything to make a buck. 6 bucks in this case.This is no more than an incredibly boring article, one which should be selling for 0.99, if that. The author goes on and on, making his case to what will continue to be, undoubtedly, a non-existent audience.If you wish to determine the relevance of Robert Lawlor's book, buy that instead. Or, take a trip to your public library. I was able to find Lawlor's book in mine.",0
Excellent cleaner and odor eliminator: This is one of two odor eliminators that I now use. This one is a good cleaner also and leaves a pleasant scent.,1
"OH GOD, the pain: I have rarely ever watched a movie as bad as this one. Sure, it's pretty to look at. Sure, it's sometimes funny. But, people, as a watched this movie, I realized what bad acting and terrible directing looked like. How did the excellent Iom Holm get a part in this mess. I guess he lost a bet. This is the Riven of films.",0
Nice gift: I did not use this product so I can only talk about the way it looks! I bought this as a gift. It appears to be durable. I like the size as it would be very easy to store.,1
"Book quality excellent: Besides the translation being brilliant, I was surprised at the book-quality.The pages are bright white, thick, between the quality of laser paper and of magazines.Even though I also purchased a good lighted magnifier, the print is quiet bold and readable.The book is sturdy, weighty, and almost 3"" thick.Very different from what I had until now, with the slippery soft covers and ricepaper/like pages...I love it.",1
"Best garlic press ever owned: This is one of the best kitchen tool purchases I ever made, though I initially hesitated spending this much money on a garlic press. Cooks Illustrated's top rating was very accurate, and this press is everything I always wished my other garlic presses were. It finely presses the garlic with no squishing out the sides, presses nearly all the garlic put in it with very little residue, is extremely easy to clean as there is no deep well to collect garlic residue, and is hefty but very comfortable to hold. My last press was an Oxo, and though it was also hefty and easy to hold, it pressed poorly in comparison and was difficult to clean. The Kuhn-Rikon is also so sturdy enough to be a lifetime purchase.",1
"Hilarious!: An unlucky country girl Shirlee Kenyon (Dolly Parton) accidentally becomes Chicago's newest talk radio celebrity by winning listeners' hearts with her down-home advice! James Woods plays the investigative reporter trying to uncover her mysterious past. A movie with a superb soundtrack and filled with comical, lighthearted situations.Recommended!",1
"Don't buy this book: This is an Audi book written for English consumers--with English address for information and repair, and (I think) models that were popular in England. Not much applies to cars common in the U.S., like Audi 4000's or 5000's (are they the same as the 80's, 90's, A6's (I don't know and the book doesn't say.))There is some brief history of Audi, a lot of racing history, and lot of turbo information, and not much else. The buying section is poor and mainly for overseas, the repairing section is only a few generic pictures and narratives and nothing usable, and the tuning only applies to turbos and high performance, nothing usable for the normal driver.There is little about how the AWD works and how to optimally drive it for the normal driver.A few tidbits of information, but definitly not a reference book.There is a whole chapter on how to keep your car from being stolen, which I found silly.Some nice pictures of race cars.I find this an armchair book and not much else.",0
"quality issues: I bought this item and it didn't work right out of the box. I returned it and got a replacement - it worked great for about 6 weeks, used only about a dozen times. It no longer works and the return period has expired. I do not recommend this product, seems to have significant quality issues.",0
good looks poor reliability: The stereo looks great on the wall. The illuminating colors are amazing. Everybody got impressed with it. But right now the CDs are not working. The only thing I can hear is the radio. And now the illuminating lights are having trouble. It has only 3 months of warranty. but it didn't last a year. I like the looks but its not reliable. They replaced it with a new one but its no wall mountable. I don't recommend it,0
"Good idea, but failed to perform!: I ordered this flashlight to use with photography. It stated in the comments that it came with three colored gels. The product did not come with gels. I returned the first one and requested the flashlight with gels, the second one also came without gels. I considered keeping one of them just to have around the house, but the cylinders where the batteries go were so tight, I could barely get the batteries in. At that point I was afraid I wouldn't be able to remove the batteries. I spent another 10 minutes just trying to remove them. I was very unhappy with this product and returned both of the flashlights. I am still waiting for my refund.",0
"beware if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant: I like the flavor of this African Nectar tea, which is why I was drinking to relax during the ""two week wait"" of my IVF cycle. I did not know at the time that hibiscus and marigold should both be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy because they can cause implantation problems and miscarriage.If you are pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, you may want to avoid this tea due to the hibiscus and the marigold.",1
"Neofascist propaganda: The problem with The Fountainhead is that it is intended to seduce its target audience (high school and college age kids) to embrace right wing politics. Kids who read The Fountainhead have seldom ever read or have a clear understanding of politics, philosophy, and sociology. After reading The Fountainhead kids will come away parroting Ayn Rand's polemics. Kids who read The Fountainhead remind me of kids who used to study the works of Karl Marx in the 60s and 70s: they put down the book thinking they now have all the answers to life. Most kids abandon objectivism (like kids in the 60s and 70s abandoned socialism) after they experience life. But, oh, how annoying they can be until then! The book still wields a cult-like trance with the young which is why The Fountainhead will always remain (after the Bible) the book most kids claim changed their lives. Happy reading! --This text refers to the hardcover edition of this title",0
"All Wrong: I was offered these batteries by amazon to go with the bark collar I purchased. So I purchased them cause they said it was the correct type of battery for the item. Well it wasn't at all. and never used them,,,wouldn't even know what to use them for.",0
"A Bargain, Yet!: For those who like Mel Brooks and are upgrading from tape to DVD, this is a bargain. Not every film is equally strong, but Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Robin Hood: Men in Tights are worth the price of this collection alone. Not all are the films are comedies, but most are. The bonus material is OK, particularly a long interview with Mel Brooks that is really just an audio track. This interview gives some real insight into how the creative process works for Brooks. Happy endings are a part of the Mel Brooks tradition, and these are found here, along with his unique style of humor that pokes fun at everyone and everything... even Mel Brooks himself.",1
Bake even strips: I was really surprised at how well these strips worked. They are easy to use and I didn't have any issues keeping them in place with the provided pins. Worked as stated,1

"A different view of New Order: I never had the chance to see New Order perform live, and having listened to this I'm sorry I never did. New Order on stage is a vastly different proposition than their fussy, perfect production studio albums. The music has a whole different feel live. The spontaneousness actually makes some of their songs more tuneful. The only regret is that the album contains only nine cuts, drawn heavilly from their 1986 album ""Brotherhood."" That said, this one is definately for fans only. Like most live albums, the appeal is likely to be lost on casual listeners.",1
"LAME: This video is not what I expected at all -- teaching me how to do a great lap dance for my husband. It's not ""lessons"" at all, just cheesy porn. Don't waste your money on this if you want to get a great lesson, get ""Erotic Strip Dance."" Much more instruction, good instruction, for your money.",0
"a poorly-written book: With all the ""10's"" customers were giving to Patton's book, I thought it would be worth my while to take a gander. After reading the first chapter I realized that I wasted my money. I went to Amazon and looked again at all the customer reviews and noticed that his seeming legion of fans were also pushing his book on all the bestselling religion titles, saying stuff like, ""If you thought this book was good, check out Richard Patton's ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth"". It is obvious that Patton and/or close friends of his have grossly abused Amazon's generous policy of allowing customers to review books.",0
"I love theses two movies: and a bonus movie sound track. The only regret is they don't have English subtitles. In one of the scenes of ""The World Unseen"", the two characters were whispering, without the subtitle, I couldn't understand what they were saying.",1

I re-checked to make sure that everything was sealed tight. My husband used it and the same thing happened.

"Boring: I tried like hell to like this album, as many internet prog fans rave about it, but after multiple listenings, I have now declared this album a total and complete dud. It is just boring. It is hard to believe that with all of the great unknown prog bands that Marillion is one of the more known ones. Lesser known prog bands like The Flower Kings and Spock's Beard blow them out of the water. Do not waste your money on this unless you want music to put you to sleep. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I give Marillion credit for trying to keep the prog name alive. They just happened to fail miserably in their attempt.",0
"Without Sin: This is one of the best books I've read in a really long time. I have never heard of this author before and I am very impressed with his work.

"The Intern Files: How to Get, Keep, and Make the Most of Your Internship: This book was a wealth of information for a couple of dollars.

I wish I would have read this before my first internship. I would have started with knowledge it took me 7 months to figure out on my own.",1

For those who like to slither and undulate across the floor or do some fast spins accompanied by serious hip-drops while knocking out a rhythm on the segat/finger cymbals, this is a dancer's album. If you are giving a house party or if chilling out is your thing, ""BD Overdrive"" is a must have for your music library. It's all here. Peace.",1
"Good Idea - Poor Execution: This is a pretty weak product across the board. Even with the updated OS, it crashes unpredictably. Took it on a trip from SF to Oregon (multiple destinations), and it worked very well. Tried to route to Tucson, AZ for my next trip, and nothing but calculation errors.On a short hop inside CA, it got me to the destination just fine. Coming back, it crashed, loosing all data.The documentation is one of the big weak spots. Looks like they wrote the documentation for a similar design, but not the same product. Makes a lot of assumptions and sometimes takes you through a process that does not describe the options the same way they appear on the system. Support also sucks. I was having problems with the IR port, and the docs say to read a separate document on the CD. The document isn't there. I contacted Technical Support, and they said to read the Help. The Help says read the document. When I told TS about this, I was told to post a message on the newsgroup. Ugly!",0
"Serious, intimate and fun. Little bit adult mood (in their record): Famous Japanese POPS/Folk Duo whos' name means fruit.It's their 7 th album and stands at the point of their carrier. This album consists of 13 songs. As they had showed at previous albums, there are two style of songs in it, but most apparently. Hard/Soft, Straight/Deep.

"Nothing New: This is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but doesn't understand him/her.I was expecting some new information about a ""secret language"". There was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the ""secret""?I agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip. The author says that cats do not get lonely. Well, that's wrong. He also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served. How does one explain cats who live with homeless street people?The title was deceiving.",0

"The best Film of all time: The Good the Bad and the Ugly can easily be called one of the greatest films of all time. From Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach's superb acting to the brilliant directing of Sergio Leone, the film is a masterpiece. The dvd allows the viewer to watch in awe of the amazing work done on this film. The composition of every shot is breathtaking and the plot is gripping. Plus, Clint Eastwood is the man!",1

"B-o-o-o-o-o-ringggggggg: I bought this book mainly going by the O'Reilly name which usually has excellent books (Java, Motif), but this book is like listening to a theoretical computer science prof. drone on and on... It literally took me three months to get through just chapter two. I kept falling asleep every time I tried to read it! Most of chapter two consists of cut-and-pasted bulleted lists each one defining a zillion terms w/o justification. So, we don't say 'acquired', we say 'captured'. Great! Can you say 'pedantic', boys and girls?Bottom line is that when an author keeps using big obfuscated words for no good reason where simpler ones would do (e.g. 'facilitate' v/s 'ease') you know you are in trouble. He is obviously writing to impress his colleagues, not to educate his readers...",0
Wonderful: This is great Italian sausage the way it should be made. Much to my surprise there was the cheese and parsley sausage sample included.

You would emerge from that attic, years later, better educated and aware than 80% of the planet. The other 20%; you could hold your own.",1

"Automatically Touching: R.E.M. is so cool and this is one of their best albums. The music is so well written. The first time I heard this record I was in amazement. They went with the lower tempo on these songs unlike their usual mid-high tempo, and it comes off as the best R.E.M. album of the 90's.My favorite song on the album is the opener 'Drive' which uses all kinds of instruments. 'Everybody Hurts' is also an instant classic along with 'Nightswimming' and 'Ignoreland' which are supreme in scale.This is a wonderful album that you just need to listen to, to believe how beautiful it is. I give it 5 stars.",1
"Agree with other poster about EToys: I ordered a Green Machine from EToys as well and when it arrived the box was trashed and it was missing two pieces. Of course we did not realize this until Christmas Eve when we went to assemble it. EToys was willing to pick it up and return it but Huffy is sending us the replacement pieces free. We haven't been able to ride this toy but I still have high hopes for it, but I wouldn't order anything from EToys again.",0
Detachable CD: One star is for the clever packaging. The other is for the band. The rest of this cd is so bad it isn't funny! Vulgarity isn't shocking anymore so why continue on and on and on with it! Up my ass is a direct rip-off from Boogie up your Butt! from that black guy on Saturday Night Live! John Hall has a great voice but he desperately needs material! Don't be sucked in! Get Shockabilly instead!,0
"Perfect for flying babies!: I got this carrier after taking back the Eddie Bauer brand. So much nicer quality! I use it all the time! Very easy to take on and off and to get a squirmy baby into and out of! This was perfect for flying with my 3-month-old. I just strapped him in, he fell asleep, and I had my hands free on the plane! I also use it when at the mall, the grocery store, or out walking the dog. The back support is great too. Washes up well. Love it!",1

"Tough and dry yoga: I am totally looking for challenging yoga DVDs. While I must admit that I found some sections to be difficult (the mega push-ups), I didn't find it challenging in an overall way: no innovative poses or new territory chartered in the area of stretching, and of course, no spiritual or inner challenges.There was no music, and Mark does more walking around and touching the women than doing the poses himself. His style seems to me that of a Football coach - he kind of stands there barking out the poses.What can I say, I did this disc once, and haven't reached for it again. Too bad. I love a physical yoga challenge!",0
"Zoom dial broken: I agree with the reviewer that stated that this clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming. The zoom dial adjusts by itself even with the slightest pressure while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired. It needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you hold it. The vaccum function is so-so, I could live without it. Noise level is unusually high, but that's least of my concerns.",0
"Dr. Zhivago: I just watched Dr.Zhivago, and found the review from ID-ea is most close to my thought. I'd felt regretted about the fate of Dr. Zhivago. I think the author Pasternak intended so for himself, and so did David Lean for this movie.ID-ea: I wish I can see your other reviews. Thanks.",1

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: As a mother, I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. After reading this book, it was obvious. I then read a chapter of the book to my 10 year old daughter. She hung on each word. This was an opportunity to spend a quantity of quality time and gave us a great deal to talk about, including discussing the ""clues"" that the author interwove throughout the chapters. We couldn't wait to read the ""Chamber of Secrets"". This book is a definite must for all ages.",1
"A Great Story Poorly Told: I'm a fan of Bukowski's work, so I was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, I gave up on it after the first 200 pages. The events of his life are so interesting and definitely worth reading about, but this biographer's writing style was repetitive and dull. Every page is essentially: ""Bukowski made this statement in (insert the name of an interview or Bukowski book here), so it must have happened like this.....""I'm sure there are much better Bukowski bios out there. Don't waste your money on this one.",0
"Punk Done Right: Deep Elm is one of the best record labels around. They routinely offer promo cds for a penny (!!!) containing many new bands, and they certainly did themselves right signing these guys. To me, they sound like a hybrid cross of early Hot Water Music (especially concerning the vocals) and under the radar era Grade. And this is a very good thing. Their lead single ""Doom! Doom! Doom!"" plays like you're standing admist a mass of bouncing bodies in a club, and you can almost see the lead singer shredding his voice, spittle flying everywhere. The album is very raw, but satisfyingly so. It is electric, and sparks with energy in spades. But above all, it feels very honest. There is nothing particluarly novel about the album, but there are no pretentions either. It is intensely catchy and enjoyable punk, that is just edgy enough to stay off of most people's radar...but you would do very well to pick this up and give it a spin.",1

"Wonder wand,: I love this vacuum so much. I have had it for over a year and it is a champ! It gets into every crevice and I sometimes use it on my sofa. Mind you,I have wood floors throughout my house so don't know how it would perform on carpet, but it is a sturdy little machine( I drop it often cause it isn't the most balanced thing when upright.) Like other reviewers have stated, the cord is short but I just leave an extension cord on it at all times. If and when this dies, I will repurchase- it's perfect!",1
Great for distance runs: I bought these because I had previously been using the Sharkies kids chews for long runs and was unable to find them at stores near me. These are the perfect size to put in my running belt and are easily digestable while I'm working out. They taste great and I even keep one in my purse for those times when I'm out doing errands and need a quick bite.,1

"was a great movie and I have never read the book: I rented this movie because I am a Rob Pattison fan. I have never read the book. I was not sure exactly what to expect either.I have to say I was completely involved in the movie. The 3 main characters played had great rolls and did a great job. I would recommend watching the movie--but this is not a movie that I would by and watch over and over again.I am an animal lover, and some of the scenes were a bit cruel to the animals, whether they were real or computerized.Rob and Reese didn't have the passion like I think they should have. That could have been better too.all in all, it was worth my money to rent it and watch it at least once. I can say it was not a waste of my time :)",1
"Weak and Inaccurate: This movie is slow, boring, and if our soldiers truly behaved as portrayed, the end should involve Hitler and Japan winning WWII.Hey, all you coffee house liberals that love this movie, pretending that our fathers who fought in WWII act like you do when you fight with your 90's girlfriends...it's called PROJECTION.If it weren't for them, you wouldn't have anywhere to whine....",0
All the reasons we went wrong in Vietnam.: Dockery list in a clear and concise manner all of the reasons for our ultimate failure in Vietnam.

"Bitter and Depressing: I read this book years ago, when I was in the intended age group. It's one of the few books from grade school I remember, because the way I felt about it was so strong. I liked it at first. The plot was touching and interesting.The problem was the end. It was bitter and depressing, and left me with a more negative worldview. To me this book was about a damaged boy finding someone who could truly understand him and bring light to his life, only to have this happiness savagely torn away from him. It sent the message that even when you find something amazing in life, you can't trust it to last.",0
"Too much head-hopping.: I purchased the unabridged audio edition of this novel, and while I was impressed with the narration, I was disappointed overall with the story. I'm a fan of vampire novels, but the vampires in this story were all evil. I just didn't care about any of them, and they spent most of the time killing and murdering each other in gruesome ways. Also, there was too much head-hopping. I would just get used to one set of characters when the author went off to discuss another group. Perhaps if I were a big white wolf gaming geek I might be overcome with interest about what one vampire clan was doing to another. But as fiction goes for the uninitiated this bored me to tears. 2 stars.",0
"So pretty and great bargain for .23k diamond ring: I received this as a gift, and I just love it. I like to pair it with my white gold cathedral style wedding ring. It enhances my beautiful wrapped wedding ring set without competing with it. Really does look like it should cost more.",1
"Another STINKEROO!: You'd really have to be desperate to waste time on this one. One of the worst Alamo films of all time, unless you count THIRTEEN DAYS TO GLORY. (Gaaaggghhh) Historical accuracy is just not there! Decent acting, absent. Believeable plot, dead on arrival.I've heard of B-grade Westerns, but this one doesn't even come close. If you are a glutton for punishment, go for it. Just don't operate heavy machinery after watching this bilge, you'll be too mind numbed.",0

Born again Astronomer: Love this book! I wish we had these books available when I was a teenager. This book covers all of the key topics in Astronomy and sets the stage for your own observing by listing out each constellation with deep sky attractions for each.,1
"Great reading: A great story about a great man, well, just a boy really. I'm amazed how someone so young could train and fly a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain. His writings are well produced and not in the style of a hero. Just how these boys handled the stress is beyond me, many died and many, including the author, suffered mentally. Todays kids could do well to read this and see what is possible when one really works at it.",1
"Simply the best CD of the 90s: Tricky's Maxinquay is his first album and by far his most accessible. Top-notch lyrics , melodic sounds and inventive beats. Yes it is dark, yes it is tortured but above all it is of irreprochable intelligence and good taste.",1
"Is there any hub that doesn't occasionally have a dead socket on boot-up?: Well, I like this product. It does what it's supposed to do. Nice to have 7 slots. In one of the slots I have my USB mouse - as with previous hubs, and even with the USB slots on my motherboard (on the back of my CPU case), I occasionally start up my PC and find that the mouse is dead and I need to reset the connection by unplugging it and plugging it back into the hub. Maybe it's the mouse? For under $20, this is a deal!",1
"Not sized well for the L-nails: The setting tool is sturdy, but the tip is too small and has no ""catch"" to help it seat onto the nails. Something a little larger or with an alignment ridge would have been better for my purposes. If you already have a decently sized nailset, this one offers little additional advantage. Otherwise, it's plenty well made and held up to use just fine.",0
Pocket Knife: The pocket knife was exactly what my husband expected and it arrived in a timely manner.,1
"DO NOT USE THIS RETAILER - Arrived Damaged and Dead: I was incredibly excited to find this watch for this price. I had already tried one on and knew the product would be of excellent quality, if it arrived in the condition it was supposed to. I first noticed a large green tag on the product which stated that the watch could not be returned if it was removed. Obviously this raised suspicion as it implied that the company anticipated a lot of returns. Watching the action of the watch, it continuously stalled and would not keep accurate time, indicating a near-dead battery. In examining the back of the watch, there was a large dent in the carbon casing in the back of the watch body. I am immediately sending this back and buying from a better retailer.",0
Real life like: This story gave me a different out look about military life. Instead of kill and be killed it let me see the brotherhood and friendship the military have towards each other. It let me see the life of service people in a funny and sometimes hilarious antidotes they get themselves into. Each chapter was a story within a story wanting me to read on just to see what new adventure the characters would take me to. The theme of the story seems to be that of a young man who joined the navy and on his first tour of duty he gets into trouble as he sailes around the world on a navy ship. Anyone that was in the military or even contemplating joining the service would enjoy reading this.,1
"Big Brother's Watching!: Definitely not his FIRST great novel, but Grisham's big ""breakthough"" novel, that made him a household name....The Firm puts Mitch McDeere, newly graduated Harvard Lawyer, against two antagonists: His new employer (""The Firm"") and the Federal Government.Both are spying on him, bugging his house, watching his every move, etc. The Firm because they are managed by the mob and monitor all young lawyers to make sure they do nothing stupid! And the government sees McDeere as their ticket in, to have an insider, to arrest people in the firm involved in illegal activities. It seems like the feds should be on his side, but carelessness on their part gets him in even more trouble with The Firm....thus he decides to try avoiding both organizations.The Firm is very suspenseful. Even before the suspense comes in, it is fun to read about Mitch's first few days on the job, learning what the law field is all about.His ideas for beating both systems is very clever. Recommended reading !",1
"Beware! Listen BEFORE you buy!: At this point there are 46 reviews on line and it seems most either love it or hate it. Be careful with this one! I own it and personally I don't really like it. It struck me as, well, insincere. The lyrics try too hard to be artsy and meaningful and Henley sings like he's acting instead of feeling. I think this was done for reasons other than the love of music, it sounds blueprinted and assembled, not conceived and nurtured. I don't know if it was producer Stan Lynch's influence in co-writing, producing, and performing on most of the songs but this project has a ""slick"" feel to it, like it's being offered by a really good used car salesman. You may really like it. But test drive this disk before you slap down the bucks.",0
"A must have item.: Folks, this kit also fits the Husky 353 (with twist-on filter) and 346XP models. The item description doesn't mention these saw models but the package does. If your saw uses a snap-on filter held in place with a spring wire, the filter in this kit won't do.As shown, this kit contains a replacement air filter, fuel filter, spark plug and a 2.6 ounce container of 2-cycle engine oil to prepare one gallon of fuel. Recommended equipment for your carry case or tool kit.A tip to save yourself a little time on the job: Remove the spark plug from the package and set the gap to spec. Replace it in the package and it will be ready to go when you need it.",1
Great video: This video is for serious steppers. It is a great tape and I really enjoy Reebok videos. They tone your body and keep you in shape if you are a veteran stepper. The movements are fun and keep you focused on your goal of keeping in shape. A must have if you are serious about staying in shape. I have tried numerous other tapes and instructors and now only do Reebok tapes because they are the best.,1
"Outstanding 90's Music: Beyond the Mind's Eye is an album featuring 15 different songs with a mix of modern, techno, and new age feel. It is the sequel to the album and, like its predecessor, offers a variety of primarily wordless music that is geared toward a variety of moods (the only two songs that do contain words are the vocal version of ""Seeds of Life"" and ""Too Far""). ""Too Far"" is an upbeat, easygoing song. ""Magic Theater"" has a sense of mystery and enchantment, and ""Nothing but Love"" is romantic. I recommend buying this album if you enjoy synthesized modern music.",1
"An oldie, but a goodie!: I remember reading this book when I was in grade school. It's pretty silly, but fun!",1
"Mediocre at best.: This heater worked well in my son's bedroom (not a large room). However, it didn't make any difference in my the termperature of my living room.The wheels DO NOT stay on so the heater can't be moved unless it has been off for at least an hour. Otherwise you will get burnt.I have programmed the heater to reach 70 and after being plugged in and turned on for over 48 hours I can report that the heater has YET to reach 70 degrees. Luckily the room is warm enough with a reading of 63.I can't say that I would buy this again. And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless their sole purpose is heating a small space.",0
"GREAT READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be one of the best books I have ever read (and I am an avid reader.) I recently saw the movie - ""Simon Birch"" - and while this movie was great - it could only portray a portion of Owen/Simon's life. The book is a great continuation of Owen (Simon's) life and I highly reccomend reading it if you enjoyed the movie.John Irving has the best character developement of any author I have ever read and I was sad to end the book and leave Owen's life. The book was great. It made me laugh and cry. Like I said before, it is one of the best books written.",1
"A Must Have for Parents and Teachers!: A LETTERation Beginning Sounds and Rhymes is a wonderful resource for teachers and parents. It is a valuable tool for teaching and reinforcing phonemic awareness. This book is very beneficial to me as a reading specialist because it can be used with a variety of grade and phonemic awareness levels. The activities are appropriate to use with an individual child, small group, or whole class. My students love to ""compete"" with each other to see how many words they can generate for the target sound. It is also fun for them to see how many words they thought of compared to the number in the book. The word lists of beginning sounds and rhyming words is endless! The directions are very clear and easy to follow. The prompt card in the back of the book is helpful when students can no longer think of words that begin with the target sound. The author did a fabulous job in making this resource easy to use and beneficial for students.",1
Buggy software: Useless to make phone calls and expect it doesn't get you hung up! Customer support is equally lousy. I will be returning this product today. Before returning I wanted to jot down how it turned out to be for me. Will update soon If I get a working product.,0
"Freddie Jackson BET On Jazz: I didn't really like this DVD. Freddie Jackson can sing, but it wasn't apparent in the way he sang on this DVD, because he changed the songs so much that they didn't sound like the songs we all bought and loved. He also sang them in a choppy manner, so it was difficult to appreciate the quality of his voice.",0
"Usable, but not great for unhappy cats: Got this to take my cats to the vet. The only real problem is that they could escape unless the zippers were held tightly by hand.Pros:-Lightweight, collapsable design is easier to store than hard plastic case-Washable liner providedCons:-The zipper and clasp closure leaves enough room for my cats to stick their heads out. If they push hard enough, they can loosen the zippers and jump all the way out-Stitching has started to fray even after light use (probably only 5 times in the past 4 years).Not recommended for cats! If you have a dog, this may not apply.",0
"Ordering a 2nd Bottle!: I am in LOVE with this product. I've been doing the natural hair thing for a few months now and it's so hardto keep the hair moisturized and most products on the market today have entirely too many chemicals.I heard about Giovanni from other natural women on YouTube so I decided to try it.I was skeptical at first but I must say, I was pleasantly surprised once I used it.I used it on wet hair the first couple of times and it did not work that great but when Itried it on dry hair, it made my hair sooo soft and detangled.I'm sure it isn't the absolute BEST product in the world but for now, this is the best I've tried.",1
I like MATH SHARK because it makes math fun!: Math Shark is fun to play because it helps you learn math. Math Shark is educational and is for kids of all ages,1
"Excellent! I LOVE IT!: I rode my bike in the Loire Valley. This book helped me in planning the route (along with Michelin Green Book). Wonderful, alluring pictures! Wonderful color code/guide system. Interesting information on the differences on the variety of castles/chateaux and churches & abbeys. Detailed yet concise history. Provides different themed tours for walking or driving. Nice pictursque maps of old towns with interests. It helped me decide which villages to stop for the night. I highly recommend this book! I also have Eyewitness Travel Guide of Paris, London, and Amsterdam. I plan to buy more books on Greece and Italy for my next trip!",1
"Classic Coen Brothers dark comedy (not for everyone): After the likes of ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""Burn After Reading"" which oddly didn't seem like Coen Brother films to me, this movie was a welcome return to the style of some of their earlier work such as ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", ""Fargo"" and ""Barton Fink"", although I did find the ending to be more abrupt and less satisfying than these other films. Then again most of their movies only get better after repeated viewings.This won't be everybody's cup of tea.Still, if you like the Coen's previous style of dark comedies (and this one will rank amongst their darkest), their offbeat sense of humor, their meticulous attention to sets and details, the quirky characters nailed by some superb performaces, then ""A Serious Man"" should work for you.",1
"Watch out!: I got Eveready batteries when I ordered this. I was expecting Duracell and that's what I wanted. When I searched in Amazon for ""Duracell rechargeable AAA,"" these came up with a photo of Duracell rechargeable batteries. But vendor Supernova shipped Eveready rechargeables, which I am not keen about using in my Duracell charger (especially when I go off to work and leave it alone all day). Note that it does not say ""Duracell"" in the product description, even though the photo is of Duracell batteries. I expected more from Amazon and its vendors. From now on, if I want Duracell, I will be sure that it says so in the product description. Starting now, because even if the Eveready batteries seem to recharge fine in the Duracell charger, I will not be comfortable leaving them in the Duracell charger for hours.",0
"Why Didn't I Think of That: A book full of hints and experiences in making things for your boat. If you only use one hint you can easily pay for this nice little investment. Well organized, sufficient illustrations, clearly written. Beats having to invent every little thing having seen what others have done in the same situation.",1
shipment: I am a sinagporean and i feel that you should have the toys ship to all over the world. i cant find some of the toys here in singapore!!! i'm 14 this year and i aboslutely ADORE carebears. they are so cute and cuddly. i love grumpy bear. his silliness makes me wanna laugh. change your rules and make it happen such that care bears can be shipped here when i want to order!,1
"nothing special: I went into reading SLAN perfectly aware of its age and inevitable naivete, and on that level it was fine. There's something charming about reading the past's view of the future.On the story and writing levels, however, I found this book terribly ordinary. I had just read Alfred Bester's DEMOLITION MAN prior to SLAN, and Bester's flair for writing and diction are far superior.If you have more books you'd like to read than you have hours in the day, pass this one for someting a bit more substantial.",0
"The worst book ever: I bought this book because it has source code for simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search and neural networks.I have used the three first source code and ... they are so buggy.They're wrote in C but doesn't compile due to evident syntax errors (so evident, are they here so as to made these source code unusable ?).The content of the book is not equilibrate (some metaheuristics aren't discussed thoroughly).If the authors use there source code, I think evereything presented in this book is completely false.Don't buy it, there are some better books to buy.",0
"Not a complete review for 2006 test!: While the verbal was OK, I felt that the quantitative was far from complete. I recently took the test and had some questions that were not reviewed in the book. For example this book did NOT cover negative exponents and the 1-2-sqrt3 ratio of a 30-60-90 triangle, both a which came about for a total of 6 questions on the test!! Granted these are simple concepts, but they were absolutly not covered in this book and hence this was not a complete review.The practice sections were clumsy in presentation. This book is dated and is NOT suitable for a complete 2006 GRE.",0
it kinda sucked: I saw a program on History Channel that referred to the book so I bought it. The book sucked.I was hoping for some more in depth discussion on the topics listed but it didn't give any.,0
"Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0: The Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0 installed, updated and ran fine.I found no problems with the product at all. Just make sure your phone is listed and your pc meets the requirements. Defragment and disk scan your pc to prevent install problems. An antivirus scan should be done also to make sure you have no viruses or other bugs to interfere with your install and use. All in all Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0 installed, updated, ran well and did what it was intended to do.",1
"Absolutely hilarious and engaging: Watched it in Norwegian with English subtitles on DVD. The character reciting American movie lines in English is hilarious. Very engaging film that keeps you interested on a neat plot. However, I still don't know how zombies can move in freezing temperatures.",1
"Rad: This movie is wonderfully entertaining. It as humor and It is suspense, fun for the whole family, because it has a family ending!",1
"Another Solid One For Erasure: Fully eight months after the release of LATEOTW, I have to conclude this is one of Erasure's best - right up there with the likes of ""Cowboy"", ""The Innocents"" and ""Chorus"". It is even better than 2005's well regarded ""Nightbird"". That I didn't recognize this earlier is no surprise. For a band as venerable and prolific as Erasure, each new release must compete for the affections of its fans with a dozen others that over the years, have reached legendary status.Initially turned off by the first few tracks (the overly upbeat ""Sucker For Love"" and second single ""Sunday Girl""), I found many of the remaining songs and competent remixes from the Storm Chaser EP to be a brilliant return to form after repeated listenings. Although no song here moves me quite like ""Fingers and Thumbs"" or ""First Contact"", I feel I have finally seen (as it were) the light.",1
"Ultimate Pink Floyd: The main reviewer of this album must be a techno-freak or something, but to the rest of us who like Pink Floyd this is an AWESOME album. I have owned this album for over 6 years and I still love it. Cluster one is a memorable piano/guitar opening which reminds of an elegant car ad. The best song on the album is high hopes, which embraces the atmosphere of the whole album. This album is really one of the only ones I have ever listened to that manages to take me to a different world (it reminds me of green wetlands). Other songs that are very good on it is A great day for freedom, Take it back, and especially Coming back to life. If only I can find more music that are as freshly unique and masterfully crafted!",1
"Dave's Opinion: This album was ruined by dubbed-in music in most songs. Simply RUINED. On most songs for example, the music is so loud, the songs can't be heard. Had I known that, I certainly would not have bought it. I don't like it.David",0
"Love this fan: I ordered the Oasis fan, light and table. I love the fan & light but not the table. The fan is very nice looking easy to assemble and runs very smoothly.",1
Great book!: I've started my own business and was recommended this book by my instructor. It is a really good book for the 'lay' business person like me! It really tells you how to think about working in your business and not for it. Very good information! I would recommend this book!,1

"Junk not worth buying: I'll make this brief...first time washing the travel mugs, the cups separated into two pieces. The Carafe as others ave mentioned drips, which is so bad you have to pour over the sink to catch the mess. Now after a month of use, the display is failing. Life is too short to put up with an annoying machine like this.",0
Sour grapes: I was looking forward to saving money with this item. Being able to recharge alkaline batteries would have saved me a great deal of money. Every alkaline battery I charged worked for a short time but would then leak.Cost me a very nice 35mm digital camera. As well as 2 battery operated tooth brushes. Too the cover lid will not stay closed. Stay away.,0
"Canon 300mm f4: Amazing piece of glass!!!!Bang on auto-focus, very effective image stabilization, minimal chromatic aberration and distortion and a fabulous smooth bokeh.Any lens at this price can't get any better.Initially I was confused between 400 f5.6 and 300 f4. But finally chose 300 f4. 400 f5.6 is cheaper and its autofocus is slightly faster but it lacks IS and its bokeh is inferior to that of 300f4.Mine usage was strictly limited to bird-photography, hence the choice. The sturdy build is worth loving, given the rough field usage it has to go through.Anybody beginning in bird photography should feel a quantum jump in the quality of his/her photographs after using this lens. For its nice price, it's also known as 'poor men's birding lens' in my bird-photographers circle ;-)I am planning to buy a 1.4X tele-converter soon. I wish canon also had 1.7X TC(like nikon); that would give me a reach of 500mm!Conclusively, this lens is a great value for money.",1
"I walked out after 30 minutes...it was that BAD!: I have NEVER walked out of a movie, however, I walked out of this one. This movie sucked so much. It would have not only been a waste of money, but time. I lost the money, but I sure as heck saved my time by walking out of the film.",0
"An Incredible simulation, but far from the real thing.: Calling this a Thin Lizzy concert is a bit of a stretch. Without Phil Lynott's contribution, this becomes more of a tribute album. A valiant effort, with John Sykes constantly trying to invoke the spirit of Lynott and the band playing the music as well as any band could. The problem is it's really not Thin Lizzy. It's just another band playing their music. Musically I could have rated this as high as three stars but for its value to any but the most desperate fan, I can't give it more than one. Stick with Live and Dangerous for the sound of the real Thin Lizzy.",0
"A Blueprint on Living: This book is an excellent resource on daily living. It teaches us to enjoy living. We are reminded that the innocense of a child is our natural state. And, the only way to happiness is to become happy as we live. Happiness is not something in the distant future or something that can be possessed. It is an inherent sense of our core that lies at the heart of every human being. Thanks, Dalai Lama, for your words of wisdom that touches our hearts and heals our soul. -- Samuel Oliver, author of, WHAT THE DYING TEACH US: LESSONS ON LIVING.",1
"Why weren't this Juliana Haterfield?: Just kidding. I really do like Juliana Hatfield though. This is not my favorite Justin Pearson band, but it's still pretty good. It's got more of a straight up hard-core vibe and less weirdo-laden content. My friends give it static because this band is now on Epitaph...but I don't really care about that. Alot of really solid bands are on Epitaph. The songs and riffs are tight, but it just seems to be missing something. Still, if you like holy molar/locust/crimson curse/swing kids/justin pearson....pick this one up.",1
"Not exactly user friendly: Threshold Competitor: A Management Simulation is used in my BUS 499 Business Strategy class at Hannibal-LaGrange College.

Students are left with many questions, and few ways of obtaining answers to them. A student hotline would be more than helpful.",0

"Best Justin Hayward solo album, you get it all with this one: I have all of the Moody Blues albums, and now CD's. I have always liked their ability to write a melody good enough to pull you inside of it and yet keep the solos (guitar or otherwise) somehow within that melody. Justin Hayward also writes some of the best words in popular music; most of his images are positive, a relief from the junk on today's popular music shelves. He also has the voice to bring anyone to the Moody Blues' music.My boy and girl, ages seven and five, ask that I play The View From The Hill CD in the car when we travel. And after we get home they fight over which one of them gets it in their room. I'm going to have to get my own copy soon.The recording sound wise is outstanding, I don't have any better than this.",1

I was going to get an ipod nano, but i saw this one, for 129.99 at circuit city I got a 4gb and it's awesome. i have 233 songs, music videos, and pictures. and if i ever need more memory i can get a memory card. the video quality is great, and the screen is twice as big as the nano's. love it!",1

"Format Key doesn't work: I liked the value of the calculator, but for class I am required to use all functions possible. I needed 9 decimals to show up for most of my calculations but the factory settings on financial calculators are usually 2 decimals. So when I needed to use the Format key it brings me IRR which is another function on the calculator. Since only two decimals show up, I rarely got to use the calculators full functions. A big disappointment, but I do think I have a defective calculator, and hopefully I get a new one or a refund. Never done this action before, but I hope I didn't waste money. Otherwise, it would be a great calculator.",0
Short life span.: I have half a dozen of SD cards from different devices and I needed a USB pen drive so I decided to buy a USB memory card reader so I could give the cards some use and skip buying another memory device. I have to say that the product looks good. It wasn't that good from the beginning it took some time for any of my computers to recognize the card but the data transfer rate was really good. It lasted a month. After which stopped working. I had the hunch that it would be like that because it used to get very hot and that is a bad symptom for electronic devices.I wont recommend to buy this model. I'm looking now for a new one and lets see how the next brand works.,0

"Cover-up At The Highest Level: James Ridgeway brings up some very interesting questions concerning 9/11 that every American should address--the Bush-Saudi connection, the FBI informant who had connections to two of the hijackers, and why nobody in the government was held accountable for this tragedy. These are just a few of the areas that should raise the question, ""Who was really responsible""??",1
"elementary and too wordy: This book contains some decent information, but is generally very elementary. It frequently states the obvious. If you've never seen a river, it might be useful. The valuable information really should and could be condensed into a booklet of one quarter this size.",0
"great product.: well worth the price. mine came w/ 9 different earbuds. 3 foam sleeves in small med and large and 3 soft flex sleeves in small med and large as well as 3 stiffer flex sleeves in small med and large also. the hardest thing about these earphones are finding the right size and shape earbuds, but after you play around with the different ear buds and find the right one, they are great. they are extremely comfortable once you get use to them. the sound is terrific and the design nearly blocks out all outside noise. great for busy environments. just be careful jogging with them in busy streets 'cause you won't be able to hear cars driving by, but great product overall. was hesitant to buy because of the price. i figured i could get two pairs of regular ear buds for that price, but am glad i spent the money. you really do get what you pay for. would recommend this product to anyone looking for ear phones w/ really good sound quality.",1
"WOW!: Dan Reed is a great musician! As far as the movie goes, one can only say, wow! As in what the heck were you thinking! We had to replay the last lines of the movie over and over again. Oh my god! The acting wasn't awful, the plot was slow and there was little or no character development, certainly not enough to explain the ending. It's possible with a lot of input from other people, Dan might make a decent movie. This isn't it.",0
"I enjoyed the majority of both CDS!: I enjoyed the majority of both CDS!Favorites include:Disc One: #7,8,11,12,13,14,19Disc Two: #1,6,8,13,15,16I like so many of the songs that those numbers really can't identify the best ones! Disc 2 is the best!",1
"A very good movie.: Okay, this movie is a mix of action and comedy. If you like movies with foul language, lots of violence, blood, and gore then DO NOT buy this movie. I myself like movies that have this, but also like everything else. This movie is mainly like the end of the world theme until a bunch of people become chosen by destiny to save the world that they live in. The movie has a lot of jokes, but it is mainly action. The characters are also very cool ESPECIALLY some creatures. My favorites are Prettz and the commander of the ""Ironwing""(the vehicle is very cool)! Please buy this movie! You'll like it! I did!",1
"My cats love it.: As soon as it goes off my cats run to it. They just love this thing. One of my cats likes it better then any of her other toys. She will huge it and play with it for hours, but she does not run from it you have to pull her off it.",0
"Where are the subtitles?: This movie was long overdue for the DVD format and is very underrated. My question is regarding the lack of subtitles. Considering that the typical American has yet to master the Vietnamese language, subtitles would have been helpful. I imagine that they'll include subtitles on the BluRay release lol.",0
"errata?: Here I am with a very pretty dress that has a top no baby could wear (neck hole too big: PIP Sundress). After putting in lots of time painstakingly piecing the thing together, I now have to not only take it apart, but figure out how to fix the pieces so I can put it back together and make it wearable. The baby is probably at least one size bigger now too! This is not the first pattern from the book that has turned out w/ incorrect proportions. I'm an intermediate crocheter w/ enough skill to read patterns, too. I know enough to follow correctly, but not enough to know I'm headed for a train wreck where joined pieces won't make the right size. Waste of time.",0
"Comprehensive: Comprehensive is certainly one word that comes to mind when reading this book. Most of Chen's research spans around the Northern dialects such as Wu as they exhibit some of the most interesting and complex sandhi phenomena of all the Chinese dialects. (e.g., dialects such as Shanghainese show evidence of an aborted evolution to transforming into a stress-based language.) On the flip side, Southern dialects such as Cantonese are virtually untouched by sandhi and have rich tone inventories inside and across word boundaries and have preserved much of the flavor of Middle Chinese.All in all an excellent read for serious scholars of Chinese languages. Be warned that this is by no means an introductory text, however those with a background in linguistics or computer science would be able to jump right into it.",1
"new age mental mush: WARNING for those who think this has something to do with the symphony or with music, it is just static new age mental mush. There is an apparent attempt to associate the works with the classical symphony, but they are totally lacking in the elements of contrast and complexity. The symphony entails much more than nice melodic themes that are played repetitively without melodic development, lacking much harmonic development, relatively little dynamic changes, and almost no color alterations. Those who like Yanni can enjoy the work; those who want something with substance should avoid.",0
"Hoary old chestnut: ""Dishonored"" was Marlene Dietrich's 2nd American film and 3rd under the tutelage of mentor Josef Von Sternberg. This is a 1931 release so the traces of silent films are still evident with minimal dialogue at times. A hoary tale of a spy who falls for a traitor, Dietrich is approximately half way betweeen the German hausfrau she had been and the sleek manicured Hollywood icon she became. The story is unbelievably banal, not helped by the miscast Victor McLaglen as the object of her affection. As usual, Von Sternberg provides some exceptional set pieces with lighting to match so the film looks good but in this case, it simply can not overcome the stupidity of the screenplay. It is a turgid boring film.The print of the film is adequate but the DVD contains no extras.",0
"What?? I can't hear you: Sure, this trainer was super easy to set up but HOLY GODS is it LOUD!! Had I known that it was going to be as loud as it was I would have sprung for the Magneto. I've already decided to return it and I fully believe that if you want a good trainer that you can actually use when other people are home, Do Not Get This One!",0
"ugh: When I pulled the movie out of the packaging the first thing I see is a ripped DVD case with what looked like BLOOD splattered on it. I was disgusted! The DVD however worked fine, but I didnt even want to touch the case to get the movie out. I threw the case away! It was DISGUSTING!",0
Do not buy this product: I bought the WORX about six mouths ago and now three batteries later it stills does not work. I'll charge the battery until the light turns green and then I'll trim the grass for about five sec. which is about the time the battery dies again. I wish there was a lower star that i could give this monstrosity of a Cordless Electric Grass Trimmer/Edger because one star just does not seem low enough. If your planing on throwing away your money then then this is the item for you.,0
"Probably edited & definately incomplete without restoration: Well, I loves these, but will have to pass. 1st, it's not the complete Tex Avery set as was released in France. 2nd, the French set was heavily edited and is missing several episodes so it wouldn't suprise me if the same was done here in a country which is far more ""PC"". 3rd, the French set wasn't restored because MGM/Turner didn't think it was cost-effective which means that it's going to be Laser Disc quality at best because that's the last time it was restored. Basically, I can't imagine that they will go to the trouble and expense it would take in order to do this right in a country which doesn't tollerate a true past (unless it's currently considered to be a plesant past). On top of that they are trying to break this down into multiple sets to soak us for more money. No thanks MGM, I'll keep my Laser Discs and enjoy ALL of the episodes in an uncut manner. Go rob some other sucker.",0
TOO MUCH SEX: I usually love the Garwood books but lately page after page is devoted to the sexual experience. I prefer a great story with a little love act but this was way too much.,0
"Nice: This is something Coltrane had a great gift for - bluesy, romantic ballads. 30+ minutes of him and his classic quartet sticking close to the tune is nice to hear. Fits in nicely with some of Trane's earlier output.",1
"Great add-on accessory: The domed lid is out of the way with this ""handy"" accessory.Would prefer the action to be hinged.",1
"Poor recording, even worse filming: This video was originally recorded in 1987 and was not very well done. There are only three cameras: one on von Karajan conducting from the harpsichord, one on some string players, and one on A. S. Mutter. The one on Mutter is too close so that for the entire concert, you never see her right hand. You see the violin, and this disembodied bow playing. The camera angles never change, so when other instruments are playing, you aren't shown them (as they're shown in most every documentary of orchestras). The bravura directing of von Karajan is mostly absent, as he's playing the harpsichord, and he seems capable only of waving time here and there rather than truly directing the group. Finally, the sound is poorly balanced: There are solo sequences in which Mutter is very difficult to hear.Finally, I should add that the video is low-res and narrow screen. Overall, a very disappointing experience.",0
Inconsistant at best: I have had 3 of these in the past few years and the last two were garbage bso QC seems to be an issure with this manufacturer.It is easy to use and the first one I bought was great and lasted for 2-3 years before it just quit working. The next two didnt read an accurate temperature so I suggest you look elswhere for a thermometer.,0
"A little too much detail for a 10 year old: I bought this book along with ""It's a Girl Thing"" (which is perfect for her age now). I didn't think this book was appropriate for my daughter who is almost 11 -- My husband and I read the book together and agreed that it will have to wait until she gets her period and/or is almost 12. It is a good book though, but not for now! It gets a little too detailed about sex, so we thought that a book that lightly touched upon the subject (""It's a Girl Thing"") was perfect for her age now.",0
"A New Generation deserves this enchanting musical!: I loved watching this movie as a child and would love for my own children to share my memories of Babette, the Pirate King, the camel and Rageddy Ann and Andy among others. In this Disney dominated era it would be nice for my kids to have something ""new"" to watch.",1
"Economically Exciting: I read this book several months ago for a critical essay assignment for one of my college econ. classes. Normally when I read books for reports, essays, or for anything other than entertainment, I find them to be painfully boring and longwinded. This book, however, was a pleasant surprise. The book details several companies in the Midwest and uses them to demonstrate the evolution of the American company. Scranton does an excellent job of giving examples of one or two companies in similar situations and then showing how different decisions led to good or bad results. The book seems to have emphasize the success or failure of compainies/entrepreneurs because of their own actions, as the book doesn't include much about the Civil War or major contracts. It was very easy to complete my assignment with this book, and I think it would even make for good recreational reading material.",1
"An essential Dzogchen text: This is a fine translation of one of the most succinct and profound Dzogchen texts, by the early Tibetan master Garab Dorje, with commentary by the great 19th century master Patrul Rinpoche. John Reynolds has produced a scholarly yet highly readable translation of this important text and commentary, and has added a very helpful and insightful introduction and commentary of his own. For anyone seriously interested in practicing Dzogchen, one of the most profound Tibetan Buddhist methods for realizing the nature of the mind, this book will be a great treasure.",1
"Best Book On The Topic: Clear, concise, practical, completely useful. If you really want to find your way without map or compass, then familiarize yourself with the content. First rate!",1
Shut the Box - Fun Game: This game is everything I expected...what a fun game! It's wonderful as you can include the whole family....it helps the smaller ones with their math skills while still having fun and challenges the adults! My eight grandchildren range in age from 27 to 7 and we can all play...no limit on number of players! Can't wait to play at Thanksgiving!,1
"Don't waste your money on these eggs!: I wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing - these eggs are TINY - they look like eggs from a sparrow or some other kind of bird, definitely not the size or shape of chicken eggs! They have a really weird smell too - almost like wet elmer's glue. I am returning them right away.",0
Fun: The whole family can watch this movie. Keeps them glued to the tv set. Just need a bowl popcorn and enjoy.,1
Great album: This album is better then KJ or John Reuben. Think of KJ without the cheese ball lyrics.,1
"another one: with so many movies, books, and shows about ""the greatest story ever told"" do we really need another one? I suppose because this one sets a record for the biggest-budgeted ""story""?There's too much violence, and the real villain Pontius Pilate is depicted as a sympathetic caring individual which is historically inaccurate. There was no way the Roman procurator would be told what to do by anyone, particularly by Jewish people, oppressed and brutalized by the Romans. In addition, this flick is completely devoid of real spirituality, but Hollywood sham abounds with ridiculous satan, slow-motion shots, and lots of blood. Then again, what can you expect from an B-movie shoot-em-up ""star"" who suddenly found his ""true calling""?What's particularly appaling is the participation of a daugher of a Holocaust survivor in this film, given Gibson-pere's statement that the Holocaust never happened.This movie will appeal to right-wing Christian zealots and Nazis.",0
"A treasure trove of sound and harmony: Although the songs aren't really that special, the way they are played and sung by Wilson and the others is amazing. Harmonies and instrumentation haven't been this well-used since vintage Beach Boys days. While Pet Sounds is obviously better, Imagination represents a return to form for this troubled genius. Well done, Brian! Welcome back!",1
"Not a durable product.: For the first few months I owned my shower radio I was quite pleased with the purchase. I received very good radio reception -- as good as my clock radio. However, after about three months it stopped working (I thought the batteries had run down). I purchased new batteries, but it no longer functions. I didn't notice anywhere that water had gotten into it... and I kept it in a place above the showerhead so any water that would have been on it was mostly condensation. Anyway... I'll not likely buy a CD player for my shower again and just stick to having one on the counter.",0
Brilliant!: I remember the first time I saw the VL100's on TV - ClubMTV to be exact. The fascination never ended - eventually I became an LD and actually had some VL's on tour.This book covers everything. I just wish this came out in 1989 when the industry was taking off!!!,1
"TRENDY: this is a terrible attempt to mainstream techno. Overall, not a good album at all, with a couple exceptions (Uberzone, Icey). definitely not recommended",0
Made for wannabees: since I know Mr Garrett and his motivation for writing these booksand have for over 16 years....I just had to buy it and see if he was still up to his old tricks. This made for what we call Twinkies and NDN Wannabees.You can buy any number of books on plants and their medicinal uses and do it without supporting someone who has associated with a known cultural thief Diane Fisher a.k.a. Dyhani Ywahoo for years and presented himself as an elder at her gatherings in Vermont. His father was respected among our people. This is yet another shameless attempt to just make money.,0
"Eight years later and still going strong: We bought this TV in 2004 and it's a workhorse. Still an amazing picture. We had to perform service on it once, and were able to replace the color wheel ourselves for $100. Not a bad service record for an eight-year old piece of electronics. The only thing about this that has aged is the lack of internet connectivity and only one HDMI port. But for gaming and the kids in the TV room, this thing is indestructible.",1
"Update From Sacramento--Still Working: Have Been On Diet Since July 20, 1999, and after starting at 270 (6' tall), I just dropped below 200 for the first time in over fifteen years. I am about 16 pounds from my original goal weight (184, my high allowed weight on the insurance tables), but am now considering lowering that goal somewhat because it just keeps working so well. I am still losing between 6 to 8 pounds per month. I feel better than I have in years. In Sept. after losing over 30 lbs., I wrote and just hoped it kept going, now I know it does.",1
"An Okay Read: Some insightful stuff, but not a lot earthshattering. Intuitive listening is the principle, and some time spent on how that is used against you (not actually your intuition, but basic assumptions that have you make snap judgements).The key is to be able to distinguish between intuition and preconceptions. It takes awareness, the book does not provide means to develop this. Instead it merely documents the phenomenon.There's probably a lot better material to spend your reading time on. Like The Tipping Point, I think the concept can be garnered quickly, you really don't need to read a whole book to get it.",0
"The bear in the picture is NOT the one you get!: This toy is TINY and not worth the price. If my small dog picks it up, the entire bear is in her mouth. A huge disappointment.",0
"Quality not worth the money: Our local grocery store source dried up, and we love the yirgacheffe, so came to Amazon hoping that we had found a replacement source. Price was acceptable - within a few cents of our grocery store price. Packaging was fine. Shipping time was as promised. Quality quite simply sucked. We picked one bag of the four at random. The beans were dry, with no 'oil' or aroma. We made a pot with the proportions of beans to water that we always use, which turned out weak and watery-tasting. VERY disappointing. We have kept the remaining bags as an emergency backup in the freezer, but honestly, hope we never have to use them! We found an acceptable alternative at a local source, at a slightly higher price, but superb quality and flavor.",0
"The Worst Quality VHS Imaginable!: I have never seen such an awful quality video transfer as this VHS release! It's unbelievable that a professional company would release such a terrible quality video. The picture quality is even worse that those EP mode (extended play) cheapies. This one's in the SP mode (standard play), but the picture is washed out, it has all kinds of lines buzzing around the edge of objects and actors. This is totally unwatchable! I had to return this video to Amazon.com for a refund, even though this is the only vhs version available to buy. I recommended that Amazon.com view this product and stop offering this totally inferior quality product for sale. But they haven't done it so far. I really don't know how good or bad this film is because I was not able to watch this video due to its WORSE THAN BAD quality. Don't waste your money.",0
flight of the phoenix: the Marco Beltrami version of this soundtrack is NOT the movie's actual soundtrack. the original starts with a Johnny Cash song.,0
"Pad surface is small and the product evaporates too quickly: I've used a similar product from a different manufacturer with more favorable results. In this case, the product worked to a degree but was gone before it could be effectively applied to a surface area of only a couple of inches. I won't buy it again.",0
"Some of the best minimalistic music ever written, not a great production though: Wim Mertens is my favourite minimalist along with Philip Glass. This soundtrack has it all. Great themes - probably the most memorable themes of any other soundtrack and intense atmospheric playing. The production of this CD though is very 'minimal', more so than any CD you'll ever buy for $20. I can not think of any other CD of that price range lacking all the essentials. A pitty.... 5+ * for the music, 1 - * for the package.",1
"Braun Activator Shaving System with LCD: This is my second Braun shaver, but it doesn't really give close shave and the battery and the charging system doesn't work good. I went back to my old one.",0
GODZILLA RULES!: This GODZILLA movie rocks. Every thing about it is great. Plus if you get the SP version you'll get all sorts of extras! No GODZILLA fan's library is complete without it! Oh yah amazon.com is the only place you should buy this movie or you'll be ripped off everywhere else!,1
"A really cool album: There was a time in my life when I thought Bryan Adams music was outdated. But, I've seen the light! ""Waking Up the Neighbours"" is definitely one of my favorite albums and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hard rock. Bryan really knows how to capture a feeling with music. Take for example, ""Thought I'd died and gone to heaven"", or ""do I have to say the words?"" Anytime I'm not in a positive state of mind, I just pop this album in and whammo! I feel excellent! If you want to have this same experience, I suggest you get this album NOW!",1
fun book: I like these books. I love disney and like to know a little back stories to the parks. For disney fans. Alot of info from a different perceptive,1
"Total POC don't buy this ""Bargain-cell"": When 'frequently purchased with whatever you're buying' pops up, read the reviews -- this thing is a worthless POC as many others have stated .... better to save your $3 for a good cup of coffee and a donut at your favorite place!! They need to have a ""no star"" rating for things like these!!",0
Slammin' Merenque!: I used to dance to Oro Solido at a lot of clubs in LA and it is sooo popular in the latin clubs there. The fast paced beat is awesome to dance to and if you are dancin' with a partner be prepared for a dizziing whirl on the dance floor!,1
"Dexter keeps getting better: This show is consistently fantastic. I got into it a few years ago, and have loved it ever since. The writing is fantastic, and all of the shows actors are really sliding into their roles. If you're looking to get the fourth season, and you're unsure about it, it means you've watched the previous three. Why am I even convincing you to get this? You know you want it.",1
If You Don't Like This Movie I'll Pull Your F***ing Face Off!!: This movie had everything a movie fan could ask for. One of the greats that will go down in my classic's book. Gnar Kill Rules!!,1
Zest for Life!: The first time I used this zester/grater I fell in love. It's makes the fluffiest grated parmesean and the zest of a lemon like a dream. Makes any other grater seem obsolete.,1
"Has worked well for 2 years now: Full disclosure: I don't own a HDTV and this is the first projector I've ever purchased. However, I've had this for over 2 years and it's been a real joy. Be warned, this thing is big. I use it for business presentations and the only case that can fit it is a rolling suitcase. It's made for movies, and in that area it is as clear, if not clearer than our CRT TVs. I would definitely buy another again.",1
"Better than I expected !!: After reading the previous reviews of this course text for my Ph.D., I was very concerned about HAVING to spend this kind of money for a ""know-nothing"" text. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The level of depth of this text is very good and I found the authors, while not necessarily that original, did an excellent job of creating relationship bridges between their various topics included in the book. Their level of coverage of specific topics in the case studies waxed and waned but for the most part added very well to the intent of the text.This is an excellent text for people stepping up to management levels within Information Systems or just beginning to get their feet wet in IS Strategic Planning. It even offers some insights that experienced IS Managers might not have reached in the past.Overall, a very good general treatment and introduction to the field.",1
"Bone density supplement: I started taking this supplement after reading research results that look promising to improve bone density. Too early to tell if it does me any good, but hopeful!",1
"Horrible Book, Impossible to Follow: This book is not only boring, and poorly written, it's near impossible to follow. I would never recommend this book.",0
Great workout!: I love this video. It is a challenging workout so I would not recommend it for someone who doesn't already have an established yoga practice. I love the different modifications for the different stages of pregnancy too.,1
"Where does the water go???: I received this product as a gift when my son was a few months old. After having it in storage for a couple of years I took it out this morning to put it up for my daughter and there's barely any water left. I called the consumer number on the back and I was told that yes, sometimes the water evaporates but no one knows where it goes. I was told it was a mystery. And there's no way to replace it. I expected a little something other than an ""I'm sorry"" from the very nice woman I spoke with, but no. We liked it very much for my son and would have given it a four star rating, but based on the fact that it does not survive the test of time, I give it only one star.As far as discarding it, I was told to bring it to an electronics recycler. There goes a few more bucks on a toy that has no use to me. Sigh.",0
"No Kidding: I already knew all this stuff in this book. I think most people do know this but they deny it when it happens to them. I have seen men actually do the same things this book acuses women of, which is basically chasing someone who doesn't want to be with them. I'm sure this problem has been around for a long time and we have all done it. Hopefully you learn after the second or third (or fourth) time! If you find yourself constantly falling for people who don't to be with you, even this book won't help you. The best thing about this book was the funny way that it was written. It was hilarious to read these scenerios which most of us have experienced from another point of view. It makes you feel a little better about it.Another book I thought was above average is Bedtime Stories for Women, written by Nancy Madore.",1
Lake House should be drowned: Patterson's latest attempt at sci-fi mystery is again an example of how bad a book could be written. This book has no real plot and is typical of the downward spiral of this author's work...,0
"LAME !!!!: This movie was so pathetic. Really bad.There is little nudity. A few topless shots, and that's it.The story line is so dumb. So dumb.The ending is weak.Overall, just a really bad movie with a fair amount of hype.Don't waste your time or money on this one.",0
"Fantastic story with humor and suspense, from the point of view of an autistic child: You have to wonder how the author of this book is not autistic himself. I guess he has had enough experience around autistic children to understand well what's in their heads. As a mom of an autistc toddler it was a great insight of how they break things down in this world and I think it will help me help her. As a plain reader, this was just a great story!",1
"Review: Not just another diet book. It doesn't offer a quick fix, but gives you tips to get you started on a new lifestyle plan for eating. I liked that some recipes are included. I found the book helpful.",1
Incredible: When I first saw this movie on abc family I was enchanted. Shannen Dohertys incredible acting immediately drew me into the movie and held my attention until the very end. This is now my favorite Christmas movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes the normal Christmas cheer mixed with a bit of mischief.,1
"Perfect: Works as expected. When plugged in, it shows up as a serial port. It sends NMEA data at 1-second intervals at 4800/8N1. It is based on the PL-2303 USB/serial port.I plugged it into my Ubuntu Linux box and it was instantly recognized and started sending data to the computer. I had to do nothing to install any drivers, since they are included with the Linux kernel.",1

Billy Joe Royal -Greatest Hits: I have always loved Billy Joe Royal and anything he sings.I really love this CD it has all my favorite songs on it.,1
"Good: Works great. had my Hv20, so it fights right into my camera without any issues..and it is from canon...so no doubt it wont work.",1
"A Slick Piece of PR: Boy, what a lame excuse at telling a story. Robertson's tale is one of rise and fall. After a stellar record Tiger crashed and burned. This surely needed to be detailed. It was not just a period of good and bad performance, but rather a time of collecting billions of dollars in performance fees when times were good and then walking away from his ""partners"" when the funds were ""under water"". The net effect was that fees far in excess of the 1% of assets and 20% of profits were collected. The readers need to understand what this means to a hedge fund investor and why this means a conflict of interest exists between fund managers and fund investors.",0
"a simple, beautifully written tale: an online review can not possibly do justice to this beautifully written book. the story is simple and honest and literally transports the reader to a mountainside in china. reading this book has completely changed my view of literature and the power it has to inspire and fuel the mind. this book should be manditory reading (what would chairman mao say to that?!).",1
"Very Disappointed: We didn't finish watching ""Ted"" because of the language and content. Bad language, bad acting, but we shouldn't have expected anything different from Seth MacFarlane. They did such a great job putting the trailer together that we were sucked in.",0
"FIRST SATURDAY IN MAY: I have quite an extensive collection of thoroughbred horse race DVD's and by far this is my least favorite of all. If your looking for black and white grainy film clips of races this is for you, otherwise I'd stick to the DVD; First Saturday in May, On The Muscle, or Barbaro a Nations Horse. The best part of this video is the box, since most fans already know the history of racing and who won what. I expected more and would return it if it were not a DVD which is non-returnable. Thank you.Barbaro - A Nation's HorseOn The Muscle: Portrait Of A Thoroughbred Racing Stable",0
This television is too large.: I went from a Sony 42 inch 1080i to this Samsung 61 inch 720p. The 42 inch picture quality is much better. The 61 inch television is nice but I can clearly detect the square pixels even in high definition broadcasts. I believe the size and not the brand causes this. I wish I had not bought this television and I cannot return it since I bought it from Amazon. I will probably get used to it but my first impression is negative.While I'm at is there is no point in buying a 1080p television until broadcasts are made in 1080p. Currently there are none unless you have a $1000 Blue Ray or HD DVD player. Your 1080p television will not be any sharper than a 720p or 1080i but you will have paid a serious premium in price.,0
"Excellent Introduction to the Field and Practice of Hypnosis: If you're looking for an excellent introduction to the field of hypnosis and the practice of this ancient art... if you want to learn hypnosis, you owe it to yourself to look into Learn Hypnosis... Now! As a Trainer of Hypnosis myself, this book is a pre-requisite for students taking my courses. The book is a thorough, step-by-step explanation of what hypnosis is (and what it isn't), and then, for people who want to go BEYOND this complete course, the author makes available further resources, including live training opportunities. If you only buy ONE book to learn hypnosis, and get practical suggestions on how to practice, Learn Hypnosis... Now! is the book for you.",1
Matrix MR500 Metronome: The Matrix MR500 Metronome is perfect! Exactly what my daughter needed and wanted for piano. Her teacher has the same one. We are very pleased!,1
"Well Done: This was recommended to me by a friend so I hadn't listened to any of the songs before I got it. I thought the intro was good but I skipped it because I wanted to get to the actual songs. It surprised me, i was expecting a ""screamo"" type (because that's the type of music my friend listens to) but it was a kind of a dance-rock that I had never heard before. They don't really sound like any other artist which is good, very original.",1
"Its too bad religion has to muck up science and mislead us: Michael Beehee's work has been discredited too many times to count ranging from a lack of participating in the scientific peer review process or in court cases (see Dover, PA.). This book has more bogus science for those who prefer faith over evidence.Thanks Mike, we all love being mislead...",0
Really Helpful for certification: I found this book to be a very useful resource for the Certification. The questions and mock exam were closer in quality and difficulty to the actual exam compared to other mock exams. I found quite a few other mock exams on the web to be misleading about how difficult the exam would be and also about what type of questions would be asked.,1
"Complete Book of Tanning Skns and Furs: This book is extremely useful to anyone entering the field of home tanning. It has a proven method for tanning any skin that is likely to be available to the home tanner, from alligators to antelope.",1
"Watch it with Gettysburg: I'm not a Civil War expert, but having recently visited Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, I paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books I read. When I came home I watched both Gettysburg and Gods and Generals again, and I must say, the events of these important battles come to life in these DVDs. Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable. The characters were well developed, as I felt that I got a chance to really know what these men were like. If you want to see history, then I would recommend this and Gettysburg as well.",1
"the best horror film of all time: This is a great film. It's also a great DVD. The special features are good too. The commentary is fantastic. This is the greatest horror film of all time, but it's not the scariest. Exorcist isn't either, read the book exorcist instead. This film is creepy, scary, and just plain brilliant. In this film you see Michael Myers's face, you see it in part 5 too. This is a great film for you horror freaks out there. Watch this with your girlfriend. Creep her out you know, then shell have to hold on to somebody (heheheheheheheheh),if you catch my griff (hehehehe) ahhhhh...I'm such an idiot. Anyways watch this and you wont be an idiot. I still haven't gone out of watching beavis and butthead do America, still stupid since that. That's funny though, watch that too. Uhhhhh please put helpful c'mon......ahhh....c'mon...c'mon. All your mean. This isn't helping is it. Uhhhh watch it there I'm helpful.",1
"Sewing Needles: I purchased these to use in repairing hunting and outdoor clothing as well as other items such as pack packs, pouches, etc. Used in conjunction with the Kevlar thread, these will be an essential part of the survival kit I am assembling.",1
Fireproof movie review: I saw this movie when it was first released. It's a wonderful movie that stresses the importance of making a decision to save your marriage at all costs. The actors are delightful. It made me cry with the beautiful sentiments expressed in it.Kirk Cameron does a great job and is a committed Christian dedicated to making movies that can be shared by the whole family. The small church in Georgia that made this movie with a small budget and broke many box office records is a real inspiration.,1
WOW!!!: WOW!!! If you like this album you must really hate your life. This album was the worst ... I've ever heard.,0
"Not quite right: This seemed like a great idea but when I received the item I realized the ""seeds"" move all around without borders sewn to keep them in their place. Therefore, it is quite the hassle to spread it all out evenly. In the picture it appeared there were quilted squares and I assumed each section held the seeds in place. not so.",0
"Best sandwich grill I ever tried: Being an older person, I was made my grilled sandwichs on the stove. This is much easier and much quicker. About 65 years ago, GE made a grill, that also had changeable plates for waffles. This was very nice, but no longer made. Thank you for bringing the sandwich grill back. It is so simple to use and cleanup. The sandwiches are great.",1
First Henna try!: I bought this henna as a protein/coloring treatment for my hair. It was the first time for me. I followed with a hot oil treatment. My hair felt incredibly strong and it stopped the breakage immediately. An important thing to consider in the future is that Henna is drying to your hair. Plan to moisturize for several weeks to regain moisture balance after using henna. That is the same with all henna according to my research. I like the 200g package and it was plenty for my APL hair. I would definitely buy this product again.,1
"YOU""VE come a long way, Fatboy: I know a lot of people aren't so happy about ""In Heaven"". I wasn't. But after I listened PAST the first fifty seconds of it, it became a really catchy (all though repetitive), fun song! Who cares wht he's doin' in heaven-I don't.",1
"Not the Best: We have owned this item for over 3 years. It still works but has been a disappointment. Occasionally one of the levers will not stay down. It doesnt toast evenly - no matter what you are toasting. Im not impressed, and if I had it to over again, I would buy something different.",0
"Better than book one: I enjoyed the second book more than the first and I really liked that one too. Anyway, I will continue reading the series.",1
"Should be made into a movie.: In this action and intrigue packed adventure Bond works with a Mossad officer, K.G.B. officers, and a sexy French D.G.S.E officer to stop a Communist hardliner from taking power in Moscow and helping Iraq during the Gulf War just before coalition forces are about to move on Iraq.",1
"Son kept getting stuck in it....................: Needless to say that this is just sitting in a corner collecting dust now. We started trying to use it when our son first turned 6 months old. Now he is 9 months. He is a long slender baby, but no matter how we tried to do it, his thighs would always catch on the underneath of the front bar. The idea of this tub was ease of use, but when it still takes myself and my husband to bathe him, there really isn't much ease to it. Don't get me wrong, I love the design. It fits our tub great. If we could get him out of it without him getting stuck, I would honestly rate it at 5 stars. When he has been in it, there were not any problems with it sliding around, or tipping forward or backwards.",0
"let it be naked: why does phil spectre get so much criticism? am i the only one who loves the phil spectre version of let it be? [...] he wrote and produced some of the most beautiful music on this earth. and no matter what you do to john lennon's voice, it still sounds like an angel. i love the choir and strings he added to the ballads, especially ""across the universe"". in fact, i think the choir and strings should be louder. buy the original version of let it be, not this.",0
"SO much better than last season.: After watching every single episode of House for years, last season seemed so bad, the story lines, the Cuddy drama... needless to say, I was wary about this season. But from the first episode I was surprised, it was completely liberated by Cuddy departure and the story lines are great, the acting is great and I don't miss 13 for an instant. If you were put off by the heavy handed writing last season, take heart, this season is funnier, sharper and more on point than ever before. We just get Hugh Laurie at his best and what else could you really ask for?",1
"poorly designed: I bought this cup because my 11 month old doesn't like hard plastic sippy cup spouts- I thought the silicone would help her along in the idea that she needs to suck. And it did. However, this cup is so poorly designed, it is not worth buying for a baby who will be using it on his/her own. If you are holding it and doing the feeding, I'm sure it would be fine. But the inside silicone insert twists along with the flimsy, impossible to line-up twist cap, so that when you're done, the spout is never where it's supposed to be. Therefore if the child holds it by the handles, he/she has to be a contortionist to get the liquid out. And even worse, the entire top is silicone so it can be easily pushed in by little fingers,so that it becomes unattached to the rim of the cup, creating huge spills. I definitely don't recommend this at all, even though I really wanted it to work!",0
"17"" XL Notebook Backback Targus: Targus produces a great quality product. The 17"" XL Notebook Backpack was however WAY to BIG for normal airport traveling. Looked like I could backpack in the moutains for a week. Definately would have to be checked luggage at the airport. My laptop is an 15.6"" Gateway which is typically too big for the average 15.4"" laptop bags. The smaller version of this 17"" XL bag the ""Chicago Citypack"", fit my laptop perfect with room to use my neoprene laptop sleeve. With is completely stuffed, it was little tight to fit under the airplane seat but worked great.",1
"A sad addition to my previous commentary ...: Just took a look at the digital waveforms on this compact disc. What a horror! Every track has been viciously compressed; the peaks are clipped to within a few fractions of a decibel of 100%, squashing all of the dynamic range out of the music in an attempt to make it sound as ""loud"" as the latest hits by Ricky Martin and Cher.This is improvement?",0
"So-o-o-o-o Disappointed: After being brought to my knees,(literally) by Thomas Otten's first album, Close to Silence, I could barely wait until his next release. I found Portraits to be extremely disappointing. I felt much of his vocals on this release were forced and I kept getting the feeling throughout the CD that this was rushed to press. I don't feel this CD came from the same place/space as his first. Hopefully his future endeavors will be able to ""capture"" the message I clearly heard/felt in his first.",0

"no more liz carlyle for me: I cant even finish the book. I'm so sick of the herione. When she's not being self-righteous she's crying. When she finally admits to herself that she was such a guillable, passive little idiot she still feels Merrick shared the blame - how is that? By remaining unconscious instead of chasing after her I guess. She is a coward and an idiot and certainly not someone I want to read a book about.This trilogy was awful. I used to really enjoy Liz Carlyle but I'm done - she isn't even writing - this is simple regurgitation. If she's going to keep putting out copycats she should at least use one of her better books to copy.",0
"Best buy for high volume needs!: This item was purchased after calling grizzly to find out if this glue gun would accept standard store bought .44 inch or 7/16"" diameter glue sticks as rather than the 1/2"" or .50 inch as advertised. The grizzly customer support was amazing. The support immediately set up a ""project"" where someone in their facility would physically verify my question. Yes the gun accepts both! They contacted me back in less than 24 hours with the results. Very highly recommended! Both for grizzly as a company and for the glue gun as well! There isn't any comparable gun in this price range on the market. Professional packaging, rapid shipping, and most of all a very good performing tool!",1
"Not very useful in practice: The purpose of this book was supposed to serve very broad groups of people: students, statisticians and engineers. Unfortunately, I found this book not quite suitable in engineering practice.From practical point of view, when dealing with reliability estimations, one has to connect mathematical theory with real-life data. It appears that to accomplish this task it is necessary to understand some basic statistical ideas, plus specifics of the subject under consideration. Sometimes common sense knowledge can come in handy. Strangely enough but many fundamental principles are in fact surprisingly simple, elegant and thus beautiful. What is missing in the book is the lack of clear explanations of fundamental statistical concepts that certainly can be presented in a complicated form but in reality they are not. On the other side, the book could serve as a solid textbook to students, statisticians and mathematicians.",0
"Very sturdy, children have played with it often.: This is a well-made, solid marble set. I expect it will last for years. There are never-ending ways to set it up. I highly recommend it.. but, I think I paid a lot less for it. The price of $57+ seems too high; I would shop around for better pricing.",1
"Strong melodies and sadly romantic.: This is arguably the best David Lanz album. He uses very simple melodies and hooks in this solo recording and it is genius.This is my favorite David Lanz. I enjoy this solo work much more then the other full instrumentation albums that tend to wash-out the woodsy resonance and intimacy captured by solo piano.i also reccomend another NARADA artist, Michael Jones, and his solo album ""seascapes"" & ""sunscapes"". Also the ""music box"" compilation.Michael Jones's creations are more virtuostic and abstract in their nature, but less melodic and demanding on the listeners attention then the simplicity of David Lanz, which is the beauty that his piano playing and this album, ""Nightfall"" represents.",1
"Very Infromative: Lots of good, in depth information of the days leading up to the bands creation, Jack Ginger and Eric's musical influences and important happenings. Thumbs up",1
"good..but..: I did not get this video from Amazon, but I did watch it. I thought it was good, following the Korean formula for historical dramas. What struck me, though, is that parts of it were a rip-off of Apocalypto, one of my all-time favorite films.",1
"PSI pruducts: After reading other review for this product I was a little reluctant to purchase it. I searched for other affordable alternatives but could find none. It is a well made imported (Asian) product. I am very happy with the performance and quality of the chuck. It is well make and an excellent value for the money. I also purchased the flat jaws and am equally happy with them. If you are looking for a product that is engineered to the highest possible standards and is manufactured in Switzerland by the finest toolmakers in the world, it probably is not for you.",1

"Amazed (and happy) to say that this worked really well!: I'm a sucker for the ""quick and easy"" hair removal kits and local drug stores. Every time I buy one (usually for my legs) I kick myself later for getting a useless, smelly, messy product. While I thought this might be the same, I gave it a try. I am *amazed* to say that this worked really well. Yes, it takes a little longer to heat up, and I probably will use a larger, flatter popsicle stick or something similar next time rather than the small, fat wand they provide. I love that it doesn't require cloth -- just the wax, and it takes so little to work. Obviously, it's going to take me a few tries to get the temperature/consistency right and to figure out the best way to get the shape I want on my eyebrows, but I will DEFINITELY use this product again!",1

"good but switch is not easy to use: Overall this is a very useful light. Every kitchen top drawer should have one. It is very bright, lasts forever, and mostly easy to use (more about that later). It is super reliable and does not take up a lot of batteries or space. It is light weight.The one problem is that the switch is not very easy to operate. You really have to depress it hard and deep and sometimes it just doesn't work at all. I can see how in a year or two of regular use the switch is going to give out and then you will have to replace it. Not a big deal at that price though.",1
"Failed Within Warranty Then Co. Jacked Me Around: Worked fine for the first several months and then failed. I tested carefully by swaping out with another unit on another machine. I called to request a RA number and instead got jacked around for about 15 minutes with an offshore technician who was very hard to understand and didn't listen. I gave up, hung up, tossed the unit and vowed to NEVER BUY FROM LINKSYS AGAIN!",0

"Should be titled, ""It's A Depressing World""...: An only, lonely child. Bullied at school. Clearly a genius level intellect, he's unchallenged and stifled since nobody, not his parents, and not even his teacher, recognizes this. A father who's always too busy to spend any time with his son. A father who's often seen, get this, reading --*reading* -- rather than paying his only son some attention! A mother, who literally, in strip after strip, throws him out the door. Throws, as in ""child flying through the air"". A child, and a small child at that, allowed repeatedly to wander alone through the woods! A child denied even a pet. His only friend -- a stuffed tiger.Makes the ""Peanuts"" look like ""The Family Circus"".",0
"More silly than profound: You probably know the story line: a woman goes to a gay maleclub and slashes her wrists in the toilet. A patron of the club findsher, saves her and they strike a bargain. She will pay him to watchher expose herself and tell her what he sees and feels. Essentially,he is to be a reporter and she an audience of one. You get the sensethat Rupert Murdoch is unlikely to buy this channel.So, with that introduction, we have a string of graphic sex scenesand pompous pronouncements on the nature of male/femalerelationships. It's hard to say which is more boring.You may be a bitamused that the male protagonist and recipient of all this wisdom is gay.Or you may find that to be merely another aspect of the overallbombasticity and pretentiouscity of this thoroughly silly film.--Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine",0
"The Crossroads of Twilight: This book is the literary equivalent of watching paint dry. It's obvious now that Jordan is being paid by the quantity of words and not the quality. He wrote 600+ pages that could have easily been reduced to 50. There were times when several pages would go by and no dialogue takes place. Instead, you have to wade through endless descriptions of how gray the sky was or what clothes someone was wearing. Then of course you're reintroduced to countless minor characters that you can't remember anything about because it's been 2 years since the last book. To top things off, the book covers only a couple of weeks in the lives of the characters and NOTHING HAPPENS!",0
"Awesome listening pleasure: I and my family enjoy so much listening to these classic ""oldies"". These songs bring back so many memories. I would highly recommend this purchase to anyone who tresures the clasic ""oldies"" sounds.",1
"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!: I wouldn't deign to befoul my lofty mental ambience with Ms. Lowell's fetid gutter pap, but a valued colleague of mine did relay her educated thoughts on this ""novel"" to me. My colleague is highly artistic and cultured so do not doubt her opinion. She remarked that the affect that reading ""When the Storm Breaks"" by Heather Lowell has upon one's state is akin to finding out that the one week in 17 years that you forgot to buy your Sweepstakes ticket, you find out that your numbers won a jackpot in excess of $39,000,0000.00. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!",0
"thrilling, romantic, and mysterious fiction. loved this book!: though this book is overly descriptive... as mentioned in the other review. i saw in no way that it hurt the value of this amazing novel. in fact this is a 3 part novel much in the same way as the lord of the rings.if you thought jk rowling's harry potter was good, you'll like this book.not because there is simply magic and good vs evil... but because there is so so so much more to it than just that... you never know what will happen next. and that is what i like about it. this book was a totally unpredictable read. i loved how it kept me on my toes. i would reccomend this book to anyone, and have to several. a beautiful story of love, friendship, and honor and all that sappy stuff that goes with it. but not overly sappy and boring like romance novels.",1

"A Kiyosaki Fan: I am a fan of Kiyosaki, but this book is mostly a waste of time.He could have condensed the whole value of the book into one chapter of Retire Young, Retire Rich. Somebody stop him before he kills the golden goose!

"AWESOME!!!!: I love the Black & Decker Brew n' Go! It is so awesome. I've had it for a couple of weeks and have experienced no problems.

"JUST KILL EVERBODY!: Greetings once more '...of the Dead' fans:The Zombie Diaries seems so bad after half an hour I'd put a bullet in my head just to get it over with! The film makers seem to be morons! Let me film you Mr. Zombie until you bite me! I found the humans more pathetic than the dead...at least the dead have an excuse. Anyone you meet in such a situation might well be a murderer/rapist so stay away from strangers...nope...shoot the guy, rape the girl...then move on.To film the death of you country rather than try to escape and survive seems a bit dumb...if trapped and unable to get away, perhaps for future (if any) generations. I really didn't like the jumpy film either, or the trees or the ground views...thought that the cameraman would be steadier?This film just doesn't have a good story and if that is what the writer wanted...not entertaining. I prefer a chase, a fight, a survival... traditional stuff OK? I'm sorry but one star, but good makeup on the zombies.",0
"Excellent: I switched from OneTouch strips mainly because Consumer Reports rated the Accu Check Compact as the most accurate. As it turns out, these are also a lot easier to use with the cartridge loaded strips and they are even less expensive.Some have complained of getting strips that are too close to expiration, but that's a seller issue that has nothing to do with the product. I've purchased these a number of times through Amazon from MySurgicalSupply and the expiration dates have always been over a year away. For example, the batch I received a couple of weeks ago expire in January 2014 which makes them good for 15 months. I doubt they get any fresher than that.",1
"At least the letters were intersting: This book is another where the translator took it upon himself to rewrite the 'colors' in the work. Boo.

"Lipo-Flavonoid Did Nothing For Me: After my trusted ENT diagnosed me with tinnitus and was told that there is not much that can be done about it, I began researching online for options. Lipo-Flavonoid came up with mixed reviews, so I figured why not give it a try. I ordered it, it arrived quickly, and I began taking it as directed on the packaging.After using up my bottle of 100 caplets my tinnitus has not improved by even the slightest amount. Maybe it'll work for you but I won't continue to take it.",0
"This radio works well: It's hard to find shower radios in the stores these days. I guess everyone's listening to their iPods in the shower. This radio works well: It gets good reception, is plenty loud enough, and has large, easy to use buttons. Downsides: 1) It would be nice if it had more preset buttons; 2) C'mon people, $70 for a RADIO? I can't figure out what it does that makes it so expensive. For that kind of money I want something extra, like a built-in Pez dispenser. Something.",1
"Difficult setup, if you can even get it to work, and not Vista compatible!!: After several hours of trying to get this thing working, I just returned it. Upon opening the box, there is a slip of paper stating that it is not compatible with Vista and that there *might* be drivers later. There is a quick start guide that looks extremely easy, and if it worked, it would be.Step 1. Throw away the quick start guideStep 2. Insert the included cd and read the 57 page user's guide that shows you how to really set it up.Step 3. Give it a shot.If you don't have encryption on your router (not a good idea) it would probably work ok. But if you do, then you must turn off the encryption, reset some settings on your pc, get the range extender to connect to your network, reset everything you just turned off and see if it works.I never got anything working, got tired of messing with it and just got a refund. It would probably be a good product if you are able to get it to work.",0

"A good effort for storm-chasing enthusiasts: I actually think that the tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was the most amazing special effect for a movie of its time. That said, the special effects in Twister are awfully good. Not much of a story line, other than people seeing how close they can get to a tornado without getting killed, but still a fun ride.",1

"A Fun Movie: Ryden Malby had it all figured out. Make good grades in high school, get a great college scholarship, keep the scholarship, graduate, and then work at the best publishing company in LA. Only things don't go quite as she planned. Instead of getting the job, she ends up unemployed and living with her crazy family once again.Crazy is NOT an understatement.Add on to that, a hot Brazillian neighbor and Adam, a guy who's been her best friend since freshman year, yet wants to be more. That's the plot.The plot, while all over the place, works well for this movie. You're not sure what scheme one of the Malbys will come up with next. Will it be her father's plan to make a fortune online selling belt buckles or perhaps her grandmother (played by the ever amazing Carol Burnett) wanting to take a look at caskets? There's always something going on, with Ryden and her love life, or lack thereof, at the center of it all.This movie defintely takes you for a ride. One that I really enjoyed.",1

Royal Hunt Does It Again: I have been a fan of Progressive Rock and Progressive Metal since the 60's. I love this band and the addition of John West from Artension was a good move. He handles the vocals well and the harmonies are great as usual. There is some great keyboard work and the songs are excellent. This band just keeps getting better with every CD. Loved the idea of a concept album from a great band. Royal Hunt has outdone themselves again.,1

"Short lifespan: I bought the pet paw and receiver around a year ago, and I only have negative things to say about the pet paw, since the receiver seems to be working fine. After a few months of use, the button became loose and would usually get stuck in the depressed position, causing the receiver to ring continuously. We had our button outside the door on a screen porch, and I believe it was dirt getting in the crack around the button that caused it to stick. Before it died completely, a new 9V battery would last only a couple weeks before needing replacement, I assume because it was in a constant transmitting state.Make the button a little more durable for large dirty paws (my dog tends to hit the button repeatedly as he sees me and eagerly awaits the door opening) and I would buy this product again in a heartbeat.",0
Altec Lansing: Just about anything you get made by Altec Lansing has good sound in it. These multimedia headphones are no exception. You get crisp clear sound with plenty of base and the volume control is excellent. Of course it helps to have a good sound card from Creative Labs in your computer. I have an external USB device from Creative labs and I am really enjoying it.,1

"the game series has been scarred: Here's the deal, I actually LOVE the video games. Even the newer ones with all the video in them have presented fun gameplay and good stories.Unfortunately, this film left me with such a bad taste that I can barely compare it to the games. Avoid this one. Halfway through I was ready to leave the theare (unfortunately I was with friends who wanted to stay).I could literaly watch ever scene of this movie and point out bad acting, bad special effects, and just plain ludicrous science at work (ships crash in outerspace but do not float?). Anyway, listen to what everyone has been telling you and avoid this movie.Play the great games instead.",0
A good overview of Civil War artillery: This book contains good material and is worth reading. Be advised most the book is not specific to Gettysburg.,1
"Surprisingly good GBC fare: The fourth installment of the long running Alone in the Dark series makes it's GameBoy Color debut, and the results are surprising. For being an 8-bit GBC game, the graphics are awesome, even reminiscent of Konami's GBC version of Metal Gear Solid. Besides the great graphics and sound, the only glaring problem with the game is that it is incredibly easy to get lost in the game and the enemies and puzzles are taxing. Not to mention the game has virtually no replay value once you beat it, no matter how much of a survival horror fan you are. Despite that though, as far as the genre goes on the GBC, there is this game and Resident Evil Gaiden, and Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare is noticibly superior. All in all, if your still playing your GameBoy Color, this game is definitely worth checking out, and from the looks of things it's most certainly better than the upcoming movie.",1
"Major dissapointment after ""The Lord Won't Mind"": After reading the first book of the Peter and Charlie trilogy I thought - finally a book about a gay long term relationship. However, One for the Gods is a major dissapointment in two areas. One - the sexuality of Peter and Charlie - are they gay or just confused? Two - Why must they be unfaithful to each other. Can't there be a book about a gay long term relationship where the couple is faithful and happy with each other?",0
"Creationism is utter stupidity: The 'theories' in this book are ridiculous. Creationism is complete ignorance to scientific fact. Face it, there are one of two possibilities: 1.

"Despite the reviews here, I think most people would agree with me.: Wow, very weird taste. I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.

A Review Written 10 Years After Having Read It***It is that good***: Even after ten years of reading this book the pull in my heartstrings still resonates. This may have been one of the best (or the best) Ms. Palmer ever wrote. The plot was simple but the development keeps the reader engaged till the end. It is sad to say that I do not pick up any of Ms. Palmer's books anymore. She used to have such a great variety and now all she has are the characters created in a town called Jacobsville.,1

"Satisfied to say the least...: When I first bought it, I took peoples advice and just put it in my cd player, took out the booklet, and listened to the cd from beginning to end.At first, to be honest, I didn't really like it. The first song, ""We're So Far Away"", may be one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard... a flat out ballad, it almost made me say ""aww"" out loud a few times. However, in general as the cd progressed, not many of the songs are catchy right off the bat, like a lot of the songs from Destination:Beautiful (e.g. summertime).However, after listening to each of the songs a few times over, I'm addicted. When I started really paying attention to the blends of guitar, piano, and voice, i fell in love...Half of the tracks could easily be prom songs, and suspension could easily become a billboard single if advertised.If your liked Mae's first album, or are a fan of Something Corporate and more of the emotional ""girlier"" (to some) type of music, you'll love this.highly recommended.",1

"Magnum Opus: Obviously from the reviews, one can infer that you either love it or hate it, a lot of fives and ones. Those who hate it said that they have found it boring which i highly disagree on. This is definitely one of the best books i have read and i recommend it to anyone. Even if you have seen the film, read the book. The movie chose to concentrate on Katheryn and the patient while the book goes deeply into the other characters. Not boring in the least...You have to read it",1

"Soul-bearing and relatable read: So I realize I'm a bit late to the party on reviewing Eat, Pray, Love which has been out quite some time. I believe some books grab you at a time when you need a pick-me-up and perhaps that is why I was moved to finally read this novel I had heard so many mixed reviews about.I'd like to start off by saying it takes guts to bear your soul in a book like this and am surprised so many dislike it, but to each his/her own. I found the soul-bearing nature of Gilbert's writing to be moving and refreshing.I really enjoyed the details of travel, especially in Italy, and felt the toughness of the routine in India and then reflective on the Indonesia experience. I can't wait to read her next novel, Committed, which seems to continue from where Eat, Pray, Love has left off.",1
"Love it so much I bought 3!: This is an amazing sports bra, after trying it, I bought two more (thankfully, they were on sale!). As a bustier woman, I appreciate the full support and flattering shape of this bra. It is like wearing a real bra with a comfy sports bra over it. It is so supportive, comfortable and shaping that I even wear it when i'm not working out. It is durable enough to endure an hour run on the treadmill. It doesn't smoosh you flat, it has molding so it keeps you perky yet tucked in. I can't say enough good things about! Highly recommend!",1
"Lesson Plans: This workbook was very helpful in planning a thematic unit. The examples are clear, and they provide the reader with a variety of ways to approach a lesson plan.",1
"Constantly Freezes!: I would've given GTA 4 Four stars but every single time i play it it freezes, and a lot of ppl have had this problem. The things i don't like about the game is: No character costumization, no safehouses to buy, and missions are very repetitive and similar to previous GTA games.",0
"Pappaji wrote in a language I cannot read: Some of the most moving and thought-provoking poetry I have ever read! At once intimate and global in its scope, Pal's work is the poetic equivalent of geneticist, Spencer Wells', ""Journey of Man.""",1
"Amazing insight, into a different world: Wonderful movie with an amazing insight into the slum life of Rio. Sure that you know the story by now. I found some similarities with 'Snatch' in a more eerie and sinister way.DVD quality is excellent. Picture is crisp and beautiful. Audio is front-center most of the time. During the action gun fighting scenes, the back surround comes alive with the bullets flying around.Very Nice movie.Own it, you would want to see it again and again.",1
"Good thing it isn't expensive: I loved mine, but I'm glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it. 6 months of use (not even daily) and it is DOA. I'm sad. I'm looking for a replacement now.",0

"The Worst on the Market: The practices advocated and discribed in this book (which are detailed in other reviews) are clearly and specifically illegal in the United States and many other countries.Child abuse in the US is defined as ""Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation""There are several documented cases in which children have died when their parents followed the clear and specific instructions in this book. There are also many testimonials of serious long-term emotional harm and infant negelct. These are not cases where the parents in question went beyond the advice of the book. This book simply and clearly provides instructions on how to comit a crime.",0
Sometimes you get what you pay for.: These glasses were not wearable because the arms are crooked and uneven. They sit lopsided on my face - so lopsided that my husband and I both started laughing when I tried them on. I have attached a picture so you can see them sitting on a flat surface. There's no way to correct it without breaking the arm. I guess that's the risk you take when you order glasses online.,0
"fantasy at its best: The Hobbit was one of the first fantasy books I was exposed to when I was younger, and even at that time I was mesmerized by the world of the Hobbit. The main characters were believable and down to earth, yet the story itself was epic. As a stand alone story it is a wonderful read, but when combined with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it makes for what I consider to be one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time. I reread these stories at least every 2 years, and it never ceases to capture my interest and stimulate my imagination. If you've never read it, do so now. If you've tried it once and didn't like it, give it a try again. One thing this story requires is a little patience. But don't most things that enrich our lives?",1
My favorite book this year!: Little did I know when I bought this book that it would be such a great companion on my trip to Paris in May. I began reading on the long flight from the West Coast and was immediately intrigued with the first line on the cover about leaving everything to start a new adventure. Then I arrive in Paris and see posters everywhere touting a new exhibit for Henri Matisse in the museum at the Luxumbourg Gardens. The whole experience was enhanced by the wonderful insights of this author. Not only have I learned new things about France and Matisse and painting but I have a new appreciation for the wonderful opportunities that keep appearing no matter what our age. I can't wait to read his next book!,1
"this is a good compilation , not great: This CD is a good, but incomplete overview of Spooky Tooth's music.

"Move! Move!! Move!!!: Awful. 2 hours of yelling. Cardboard characters. Predictable beginning, middle, and end. Non-stop melodramatic music (to dictate to the viewer how he or she should feel.) No more than a paragraph of meaningful dialouge and no, I am not being hyperbolic. The ""movie"" was, essentialy, like watching someone else play a sci-fi video game for 120 minutes. Even as an exercise in escapism-this movie failed. The cliches were so over-used as to be insulting to the viewer. There was zero attempt by the writer(s)/ director to make this into anything more than an extended preview of, well, any given CGI riddled train wreck. You could literally watch this movie without the sound on and you would miss nothing of its plot. Save your money.",0

"Not bad for a salty crunchy low carb snack!: I must say, I was not sure what to expect when ordering these. I have been trying to stay on a low carb plan for a while, but the one thing I missed a lot was chips/crackers. I have experimented with baking different things and even trying to fry up my own root vegetables. Nothing really worked well.I stumbled on these one day and bought the Pizza flavor and the White cheddar. They are both quite good, however, they are a bit TOO salty and that says a lot coming from a salt-a-holic like myself. LOL.I have not checked yet to find out if they just have a ""plain"" cheese with none of the additional additives, but if they do I will try them next to see if the salt is lower.Oh, and you can barely eat a whole bag. These are small bags, but they are rich. I found that I only needed a small amount to satisfy that salty/crunchy craving. So they will go pretty far I think.Would recommend for anyone trying to stay low carb.",1
"First one wouldn''t open, second one fell apart when opened :(: I could not open this stove. Recently another customer had the same problem. Sent it back and Amazon was very good about sending another. The second stove opened and immediately one of the ""windblock side panels"" fell off. The rivited clip that should hold it on was loose and flapping in the breeze. Another recent customer had this problem also. There was no box damage; these stoves are made incredibly shoddy. Formerly a coleman stove was something you could pass on to your kids; this one will be passed on to the land fill in a year or two. Amazon took back the second stove, and compensated me for my trouble.",0
poor service: Will never order from you again! Having to wait 3 day with a weekend coming up is very poor service !,0
"Popper has started to leak motor oil: This popcorn popper worked fine for a few months. It is not straightforward to clean, but that was OK. Today I noticed that oil/grease from the motor unit that stirs the popcorm has started to leak from the edge of the top of the popper, at the edge of the teflon, where this oil/grease can get into food. This is clearly motor grease/oil, looking and feeling much like motor oil from an automobile, not like organic canola oil I use in popping. Naturally, I won't be using this popper any more, as I do not prefer to eat food contaminated with motor oil.",0
"Hard to review: I really like this album, but it doesn't have the immediate impact as ""Phaedra"" does. What I mean is that you can't really sit down and listen to this album as attentively as you can with ""Phaedra."" You have to be really relaxed to get the full effect...but what effect! I almost prefer this album to ""Phaedra"" because there are less songs, ergo less changes in mood, and the sound sort of drifts from one mood to the next. Also, this album is a lot more relaxed than thier previous. Listening to this album is like watching the times of day go by in a little over half an hour. Definatly not reccommended to those with a short attention span!",1
"A High School Student's Perspective: I used this book for physics my sophomore year, and I have mixed feelings regarding the book. On one hand, the text does not clearly and concisely explain concepts, but on the other hand, the end-of-chapter summaries and the practice problems were great preparation for tests. I doubt you will find more difficult problems than those this author gives, and your teacher would have to be a sadist to test you with problems harder than these. As another reviewer stated, you must couple this book with the lessons of a teacher - it would be very difficult to attain a firm grasp of the concepts based on this book alone. But if you're looking for concise lists of equations and challenging applications, this book will serve you well.",1
"Surprisingly good, despite goofy premise: I resisted this show for the longest, because the plot sounded so goofy. But the reviews were so darned good, i decided to give it a chance. Wow. Great show. Two episodes into the first season and I was hooked, particularly with the oddball nerd turned werewolf, played by Russell Tovey. Season Two continues the fun, though it's a bit darker, as many have noted. I won't say it's a perfect show, but there's plenty to think about, including the idea that, if God created man in his own image, could he have also created beings in the image of his wrath and rage?",1
"ZERO STARS - TOTAL CRAP: my husband gifted me these boots, which I tried at a local store back in October.they seemed comfortable and well made....boy, was i wrong.got the first pair mid-december and within the first week of wearing them, the plastic heel part fell off from the right boot.i returned that pair and got my second pair from amazon right away.wore the second pair 3 times and the leather was becoming unglued from the sole on BOTH SHOES.needless to say, i returned the 2nd pair for a full refund.what a shame.beautiful, comfy shoes that are poorly made and a total disaster.",0
"Wish I Hadn't Bothered: If I could have given this book no stars I would have. It was a complete waste of money and time. Ms. Bacall comes across as a sour, shrewish old woman. I don't know why actors think their political opinions are the ones we should all have. Her disdain for her fellow Americans and our President lost her this former fan. I've read my last book by Bacall.",0
"Buy something else: Out of the box the thing never worked right: inconsistent spacing and alignment of characters, constant problems with the feed mechanism and cutter. Also, by design the characters are too far apart. Finally, after very infrequent use, it gave out entirely. Anybody got a recommendation for a label maker that works well but doesn't cost 20 or 30 bucks?",0
"Maybe I Got a Knockoff: Interesting most of the reviews say the performance(hp) of the engine improves and the mpg stays about the same. I would say my performance stayed about the same and my mpg went down a good 2-3 mpg. I am rather disappointed by this product in how it has mostly hurt the performance of my 2008 Civic. I suppose you can do worse, but like maybe those other products that are supposed to do great things for your car(like oil additives), just save the extra $40-50 and replace your air filter with any ok one every 50,000 and you will be allright. I can't recommend the K&N.",0
"Rambling, Dull & Badly Written.: This book rambled on through a fairly stupid vampire's angst. It started out well & then the plot went on a road-trip & never returned. It didn't even get into WHY her sister was killing musicians! What did it mean? Where was it going? What a waste of money. If only you could return books like you can return anything else you're not satisfied with!",0
"Simple and to the point: If you've seen The Secret, and you want more, this is a simple, to the point no nonsense direct description of feelings and how they work in bringing what you think into your life. Feelings are the language the Universe (or energy) responds to. It's the beginning of designing a better life.This little book is so powerful, I keep it with me as a daily reading to keep reminded that a shift in feeling can change what I am headed towards. It also reminds me WHY I want to keep on this path of feeling good.",1

"Short, and all you'll need to pass: I scored 69/80 after reading only this book. I read it 4 times over the course of 3 weeks, then passed the exam. There were some questions on topics that I'm sure were not in this book, but not enough to keep me from passing (easily)! Good luck on your own exam.",1
"This is the best hair straightener I've ever owned!: It's the honest truth! I've searched high and low for a reasonably priced way to straighten my hair. I have naturally CURLY hair, but am blessed enough to be able to get it to straighten with some help. I usually have to blow dry forever, use some sort of product to smooth it out and then go over and over and over with a straightening iron or big barrel curling iron. This iron gets my hair silky smooth usually in one swipe, but at most two. I can have my hair looking awesomely straight within ten minutes, whereas it use to take me twenty to thirty. It also doesn't leave my hair feeling like straw or looking fuzzy afterwards, which is a huge bonus. I am SO happy to have this iron and even am thinking of buying another one, just in case this one breaks down the road. You won't regret buying this iron!!",1
Can't put it down!: James Patterson has done it again! Another 'can't-put-it-down' creation...I am totally hooked and can't help but follow Alex Cross to see where the story ends.,1
"Excessive exclusions of important potential entries renders this reference of little value.: Obviously in a field as large as mystery writing some limits had to be established to produce this relatively small book, somewhat longer than 200 pages. However, in this case the limits are so restrictive as to make this book of relatively little value to the mystery enthusiast.The book is organized alphabetically, with a section for each letter of the alphabet and an index. However, there is no section for X, and the sections for Y and Z are only a half-page each. The entries present are well written, but there are simply too few entries. For example, although the book's title is ""Whodunit?: A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing"" by my count there are only three authors listed under A and seven under T.Because of the excessive pruning of significant and even important potential entries, this is not a book than can be recommend as a reference.",0
"A must-have for little Spidey fans!: We purchased this toy for my son's 2nd birthday, and he can't get enough of it! His legs aren't quite long enough to be able to pedal, but he moves it with his feet with no problems.The sound effects are quite clear, and I have even heard him singing along a few times. His older brother is really sad that he is too big for the trike!Assembly was a snap - my husband had it together in 20 minutes or so.",1
"Worked great for 4 months: I used this bike cover for a bike I store outdoors in the California sunshine. Did a nice job keeping it dry and relatively dust free. After 4 months though the fabric over the handlebars tore due to weakness in the sun bleached fabric. It eventually tore the length of the bike, rendering it mostly useless.Reccommedation: no good for prolonged outdoor storage.",0
"Bulk Cheez?: I thought this book would be a super simplistic and insulting happy-go-lucky Christian pulp offering. While the cover art, picture and title all lean towards that interpretation, and the meat sometimes does too, I've found that the prayers at the end of each chapter are great. They are insightful and give words to my feelings. They help me really pray for my wife in a way I've never done before. Mrs. Omartian has revived my commitment that I made 10 years ago in a spiritual way that I've always wanted.This isn't a feel-good quick read. It is a tool.",1
"It's a good book. . . to help you go to sleep: In my opinion this book is horrible. every word in the book left me utterly confused. I have read other reviews here and I see that many people who have read the book say that ""it's a good book but I needed the cliff notes"". Well, if it really is a great book it should hace captivated you as the reader and let the words flow instead of reading a section and than have to consult your cliff notes. If you want to read a GOOD Faulkner book, I suggest as I Lay Dying. That book is truely a masterpiece.",0
"Real Bad: After reading reviews I picked it from library.Singing is really horrible. I am surprised to see So many 5 stars (or even 4, 3, 2)?Don't have much else to say, just wanted to give 1 star for bad singing.Kids might like it because songs are popular. (BUT we'll be forced to listen it while kids are listening it!)One good songs DVD which I recommend is Baby Boost Nursery Rhymes.I haven't bought it, have got DVD few times from library. Also it's on comcast on-demand (free).",0
"An Astonishing Rip-Off: I wanted to give this much-maligned picture a shot and see if it offered the fun of Dino's underrated Flash Gordan picture.

It has nothing to do with the band, just heresay and nothing at all interesting! an english lady reads it and there's no NO Doubt music at all. It wasn't even written by no doubt and it contains no real info just when their albums came out and what label. I buy EVERYthing that's no doubt and I wouldn't spend a dollar on it!!",0
"I second the ""Villa of Boredom"": While the ""Villa of Boredom"" reviewer already said a lot of the same things, much better than I could. The book was slow, the characters were bland, and some were moderately unlikeable. The so called hero seemed to be in the background of most of the book. Personally I found the ""crazy"" pathologist the truely likeable actual hero of the book, although she also seemed to take a back seat at times. I listened to the audio format, and the narrator's grating female impression also made things worse.",0
"Samples are good, but...: I'll never let someone else (a music company) decide what I can do with a CD I pay good money for. Take a leap, dudes, and apologize to a great artist who deserves a company that won't play politics with her music.And hey, label executives: SUck it.",0
"Terrible...: KenpoX is one of the worst DVDs in the P90x series. I have P90x and I substitute The Pit Workout by John Hackleman.

"Sent the wrong size: I ordered this 65 cm ball and when it arrived, the box said 65 cm but the ball measures 55 cm. This seems to be a common problem with exercise balls in general, and I suppose one advantage is that this ball is direct from Amazon, so returning it and getting a replacement is relatively easy. Still, I looked into this issue before deciding on this ball, and this ball seemed to be pretty good in this regard, so I'm frustrated.",0
"Diggety Devon ROCKS!!!: As an adult I absolutely loved this CD and kids seem to love it even more! The songs are fun, entertaining and more than palatable to the adult ear! But more importantly the messages within the lyrics of the songs are powerful and pertinent to kids AND adults. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone you know who has kids.",1
"4.5 stars actually: i dont know why this movie flopped. yes, yes, a few holes in the script (what is rabbit's foot? how did he get it from outta there in less than 2 hours?) but it was good fun, intense, action-packed, storyline with a twist (not predictable, not boring), very good acting from T. Cruise (i don't like him too much, but the man can act!). all in all more than i expected and well worth the time spent in the theatre.",1
"Creative and emotional.: A short book full of poems and stories centered on modern life around the reservation. There are times when the writing is deep and emotional, times when it is laid back and thoughtful and times when the story is only that; a story told to those who are listening. It is all very modern-creative type writing with a deeper meaning settled somewhere within, but it is all so beautifully done that you might just find yourself revisiting the book again and again. You might even have a different experience each time you do, but it will always be a wonderful journey.",1
"And the Point Is?: This poorly written book (""cops"" is constantly used to designate the police or others investigating the ""crimes"" of the mother and son who are the ""stars"" of this book. The author seems to have rushed to print after ""cutting and pasting"" from numerous newspaper and magazines articles without even attempting to tell us why they behaved as they did and of course the book ends in the middle of the story. The murder charges are not resolved by the time the book hit the streets, but it seems to be like a trail in the wilderness.....the dam thing just ends. But, you are thankful that it is over because it was not quite bad enough to toss, and there was always hope that the next chapter would reveal the secrets of the admittedly strange mother and son, so you keep reading. But in the end you are quite unsatisfied and full of wonder about why some books are published. Since the story was not finished, I wondered what the point was of telling it.",0
"Wouldn't have bought if I could have seen a demo.: The handset is really cheap. Feels like I'm holding a toy to my ear. All the phone's features are driven by a digital display (like digital watches have). Anyways, it's hard to read; I think my watch's display is bigger. Also there's no backlight so you can't read it in the dark.The biggest reason I bought this phone is because I switched to my phone company's voicemail system and had no way of knowing when someone left me a message. This phone does have an indicator on the display that you have a message. It's a little envelope icon that's about the size of a pencil led. Very easy to miss.To sum up, this phone serves the purpose but it's not what I was hoping for.",0
"It's not music anymore!: First of all, making the weirdest sounds possible on yourguitar and NOT trying to sound structured in any way has never been myidea of fun. Fripp does not even have to make it pretty to satisfy me-at least make it sound like something. Second, He DEFINETLY does not have to play it for 50 minutes at a time. Third, dragging the sound back and forth between the stereo channels reminds me more of '60s Bachelor Pad Music than ""art"". END",0
"polished electro-pop: Chicane is one of those anonymous one-man DJ outfits most people will probably first encounter on one of the many ""chill-out"" compilations that are currently filling record store CD racks. That's what happened to me, and I rushed right out to purchase ""Behind the Sun"" just so I could listen to ""No Ordinary Morning"" over and over. I love electronic music that can utilize a pop sensibility (strong melodies with compelling vocals) and Chicane certainly fits that description. If you're looking for a point of comparison (always a reviewer's easy way out) think Bent, Olive or Future Sound of London. The brains behind Chicane - composer Nick Bracegirdle - has managed to incorporate unusual guest vocalists (Maire Brennan of Clannad, 80's popster Bryan Adams) without making it seem gimmicky or contrived. The music is bright, polished and listenable throughout. A great addition to any collection of contemporary electronic music.",1
"Finished reading this book . . .: On a white hot sunny afternoon in July, which seemed to fit the excruciating description of Bill's trip with his friend Allan to Alice Springs. I particularly enjoyed the Perth and New South Wales bits for their greeness and freshness, and what a rousing introduction for me into the world of travel books after six years of what has mostly been high-brow literature! I relished every anecdote, but here is a warning: if you are a fan of the high-brow literature Bryson's prose is disappointingly without song. He is funny, and a tremendous source of information, but he abuses abstract adjectives like 'splendid,' 'comfortable,' and phrases like 'of course.' Perhaps these terms are the trademark of travel writing; since I am new to the field I can't say for sure. All in all, though, this book was 'splendid.' I am off to ship it to my father in Ohio. I am hoping he will find it 'splendid' as well.",1
"AWFUL - AWFUL - AWFUL!!!: Talk about typos!! WOW! I can't remember how many times I found the word THOUGH and it should have been THOUGHT. I also found the word probable and it should have been probably. When I read a book I expect the author to be able to spell. This author can't spell OR WRITE. Her style is bad, very choppy and boring. I guess she never heard of spell check. This book was very hard to finish because of the typos and the poor writing style.",0
"Fine, if your only definition of ""pest"" is ""ants"": They want you to purchase the product with a broad definition of ""pest,"" but if it fails, they narrow the definition of pests to ""insects.""

Go to a seed-supply store and get a clamp-down metal lid for your bird seed. It's the only way to deal with the problem.",0
"She lost the point of the Camino: The author completely lost the point of El Camino. This pilgrimage, about 1000 years old, is a Christian Catholic route. I have made the pilgrimage myself last year. All the teachings and stops during the way confirm the validity of the teachings in the Bible, and they are very different from the things MacLaine describes as her findings.",0
"well written and engaging: It is difficult not to give this book a 5, as the author does a terrific job of bringing the freshness of experience and volatility of youth out with vivid characters, unpredictable plot and poetic turns of phrase. It's a clever spin on the coming of age novel, but doesn't have the resonance of a more heavyweight work. Overall a funny and poignant story, made more so by the unfortunate loss of the author.",1

GREAT READING: I read this book twice in a year's time. The author made the characters very real. I thought about the story line and characters for days after finishing the book. This is my 3rd story by Ms. Ray. She is becoming my favorite author and I'm looking forward to reading other books by her.,1
"YAWN!!!!: I have not read Lincoln Child's books and apparently this was not a good one to start with. I was bored to the point where I read 150 pages and then brought the book back to the library. I was disappointed with the slooooow plot development, the annoying hangers at the end of the chapters that are not revealed in following chapter or even the chapter following it. Thrillers are my genre, but this book was not my cup of tea......",0

"Violent! too much!!!: There is nothing special about this book! All the entire thing of dragon ball z is about is violence! I, as a kid my self, think it is far too violent! If you get this book for anyone, do not get it for young readers. It is a very bad example! And a total waste of money!",0
"An overall amazing compilation: Some of this stuff is amazing. There are weak moments - if you're thinking of getting this just because you're a Morricone fan, beware - Gusgus' mindless butchering of Good, the Bad and the Ugly is horrible. But mostly this collection should please just about anyone. Which is hard to say for an electronic release. The Rip Off Artist's take on Dean Martin's ""Sway"" has to be heard to be believed. Everyone I've played it for has just had their jaw drop. ""Watermelon Fan"" is great fun as well, as are a few other standout tracks. You won't be sorry for having gotten this. The only reason I wouldn't rank it a 5-star thingy is because the Gusgus remix is a prime example of everything wrong about bad remixing. Otherwise though people will think ""you da man!"" (or woman as the case may be) for playing this at your next swingin' soiree.",1
"WOW...much better in Blue Ray: Ok, so this movie is pretty good as is, BUT in Blue Ray with a large High Definition TV and Sound System...WOW!!!!What a difference.For those that have not seen this movie, one of Sylvester Stallone classics.

"Excellent book - lousy binding: As other reviewers have reported, this is an exceptional, comprehensive introduction to the animal kingdom. The organization according to taxonomy is very helpful, and the taxonomy used is a well-thought-out compromise in this time of terminological controversy and shifting opinion in systematics. The photography is gorgeous, and the text hits the important high points.The only disappointment is the shoddy binding. As others have mentioned, this is a VERY big book, and it is made all the more weighty by the use of thick glossy paper that makes the graphics shine. Such a book requires a particularly ""industrial strength"" library binding. Sadly, the book is bound as though it were a coffee table book that need not stand up to much more than an occasional desultory browsing. I've had it in my classroom for less than a year, and the constant use it gets has already worn out the binding. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.",1
worst popper ever: I am about to throw this away. Every single time I use it the popper blows all the kernels out. There's barely any left to pop. I have tried different brands of kernels to see if it changes anything but nothing works. I would not buy this again - it's a waste of money.,0
umm... works awesome: I bought this gun for my brothers as a Christmas gift not really expecting it to be that good or even arrive by Christmas. But within a week the seller had it processed and shipped and they arried on Christmas eve. And they work great too. I was shot in the leg from fifteen feet away and it hurt like hell. A good sign i'm told. The battery life is pretty long lasting so you're not throwing your money away in that area and they haven't jammed yet.,1
"fooled again: Upon recieving this Blue Ray disc and watching it, I found out that none of the WWII footage was transformed to Hi-Def, only the maps were of high quality. And since most of the program was WWII footage, I was very dissapointed. The only reason I bought this was because it claimed to be Blue Ray quality. To me, this is false advertising. Shame on you.",0
"DOESN'T WORK: I've tried this product with diet and excercise and it didn't do nothing at all,as all the products from this manufacturer, doesn't work! don't waste your money!",0
"Interesting book about a shady character: Dr. Bennett was indeed a person of questionable morals and ideas, perfect for Mormonism in its Nauvoo, Ill. period. Not well-known in the present Mormon church, he presented quite a thorn in its side after leaving it. First book I've come across that gives a detailed account of his life. His book ""History of the Saints"" has been torn apart as a book full of lies, but history has proven at least some of it's contents as being factual. Clint Lauricella",1
"The Ultimate Career Guide (really!): This is one of those few business books that you can read more than once. D'Alessandro makes one key point with this book - you don't get to the top by being great, but by not screwing up. This point is made through countless stories that he tells about his career.D'Alessandro is not arrogant, like many (if not most) other business authors. Rather, he is hilarious. I lost count at how many times I laughed so hard, interrupted my wife, and related a story from this book. This is what I want out of a career guide - a book that conveys it's point so well, and in many different ways, that you can't help but to remember it.If you work in the real world, and need a career guide (trust me, you do), then this book is for you. I have recommended it to others several times, and have been thanked often for the referrals.",1

"Amish teaser: This is not the kind of book I usually read. (A story about the Amish? Yawn!) It was a gift . I probably wouldn't have bought it myself. But I'm glad I read it. The book was a bit slow paced at first-like what we imagine Amish life to be - but before long I was hooked! If Ms. Lewis doesn't hurry up and write the sequel ( Abram's Daughters 2), I'll break out in a rash. I guess I'll just have to read her other books in the meantime! Did I mention there is no graphic sex, violence, or swearing? And you DON'T CARE!! There is love, mystery, happiness, tragedy, loyalty, all the ingredients of a good read. Just what I like in a book. I'm itchin' to read the next installment in the lives of Abram's daughters!",1
"23 minutes in hell: I was actually quite disappointed in this book. I have read 23 minutes in heaven, which I found to be much better. Obviously the subject of location is different, but I didn't think the writer has a whole book of material here.",0
"Faith and Betrayal: I was so glad to be able to read this book. I have a Great grandmother who was put on a ship at the age of 13 from Denmark, sent to the Mormans all alone, no other family member came. Her mother and father divorced in Denmark, over this desire of my great grandmother's mother to join the Mormans, she herself never came to America. This left my Great Grandmother to fend for herself. I had never been able to understand how this could possibly have happened, until I read this account. Like Jean Rio, she came to dispise the Morman Faith and her descendents in general refered to themselves as ""Jack Mormans"".",1
"Not for 850 MHz: I intended to purchase a true 4-band cel which I could use in any place, and I trusted Amazon description which states ""Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz"".But when I inserted the SIM of a 850 MHz network the cell did not work, after some searching in the cel menus I found out that Amazon description is wrong, since it is intended only for 900, 1800 and 1900 MH.So be careful if you need to use it overseas..........",0
"Astonishingly poor construction: Toro should be embarrassed to have their name on this thing. Don't let the picture fool you, the case and grips are made of the cheapest plastic imaginable. That's right, the red housing in the picture is cheap plastic, not even good plastic. Grabbing the handle one is met with squeaks of protest by the ill-fitting plastics moving against each other. I cannot say how the thing works; the manufacture is so poor I could not get parts lined up to attach the handle.Let me put it this way--China must have outsourced its construction to some place with lower labor costs; if someone from China were to buy this, they're first reaction would be to ask, ""who built this piece of junk?"" Not recommended at all.",0
"Good transfer of a very old movie: First off, its amazing how many people complain about bad quality of old old movies.I wanted to get a good copy of this (to replace my VHS) and opted for a this version. I was a little wary looking at a review, but I was very pleased. I put it in my DVD/Bluray and it up-played it even more. Compared to older copies, this is probably the best that we can make a movie shot on film almost 60 years ago.Video 8/10Sound 8/10Highly recommend!",1

"Mariah is Back...and in BIG WAY!: Be prepared to be 'Charmed' all over again by the biggest selling female artist of all time. Mariah's new album ""Charmbraclet"" is her most mature collection up to date. Her love for R&B is very apparent here. The songs flow together like silk sewn together with masterful precision. I highly reccommed that everyone buy this album and she what a true singer/songwriter is capable of. A few of the highlights are Mariah's cover of ""Bringin' On The Heartache"", originally done by Def Leppard, ""The One"", ""Boy(You Got Me)"", and ""Subtle Invitation""...but please realize that every song is equally as good. MARIAH IS BACK! Get this album and you will not be disspointed!",1

"depends on what you expect: If you expect a cheap camera with limited functionality and picture-taking that will only work in good light, then this is a good camera for you.When we purchased the camera, I didn't expect that it would be as bad as it is indoors. It truly does poorly any time the flash is involved unless you're using the flash as a fill-in flash.Outdoors, in good light, it does reasonably well. Otherwise, it's a pretty lousy camera.",0

"Became an artist in his mid 30's: I got the book for class, but been wanting to read it before that. Danny Gregory is everywhere on the web, there are a bunch of artist that i love linked to him. And he has a great inspiring story to share with everyone.He promotes journals, but you have to draw on them, everyday, and put down not only what worrys you but the beautiful things in your life as well . That way not only you have a record of your story, but your drawings improve, and you have a record of your improvement.Who cares if your drawings are not the way you think they should be. like he says ""shut up and draw""; you'll see you start to get better.The book it self is hard to read,it is not a book to read from cover to end in one sitting. Probably you won't even want to. You might be puting it down to draw your self.",1
"absolute best!!!: Got tired of colds and getting antibiotics.Was told I had ""walking pneumonia"" ( for almost 1.5 years ).Was recommended this Aerobic 07 product ( taken with distilled water only ) and got cured of pneumonia in three days.( not a joke. I'm totally serious about this ).Don't believe me? Try it for yourself. I've never felt better in all my life.( And to think, I only used to bring this product with me when I went camping,... this is some serious kung-fu against colds and flus. )",1

"I put back food to buy this: I saw this book at Costco and put back food from my basket so I could buy it - after the last installment, I was on pins and needles to see what happened to Agent Pendergast. And it was worth it! This story deepens the character of Pendergast, giving him a more vulnerable dimension, while introducing the nasty Diogenes, and bringing in the courageous Viola. I look forward to seeing more of her in future books. My one nit was the Kiva mask subplot, which went on and on, and the twist with a particular female character involved in that subplot. Sometimes authors need to brave enough to really knock off one of their favorite characters to gain a level of legitimacy. I felt a little cheated, but who cares, I'll be first in line (or close!) to buy the next book! Keep up the great work, guys!",1
"One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen: Adam Sandler plays a painfully shy man who has extreme fits of violent anger and has to deal with 7 sisters constantly interferring with his life. He calls a phone sex line one evening and is then hounded by the man running the service. This takes place the same time he meets a woman who likes him despite his oddities.The sad thing is I think there is probably a sweet, poignant love story in this film but it's buried in a morass of pointless scenes and a discordant soundtrack that is sometimes so loud it nearly drowns out the dialog. There is no reason shown why Emily Watson would fall in love with Sandler. It's really just one strange scene after another that in the end is dull and left me wishing I'd rented another movie.",0
truedat: Wow...what horrible acting for the most part. Only exception is the tall cop with 3 stripes (I think it is a sergeants rank)He was natural. A couple of kids were good as well. Very good job as short as his scenes were. The main bad guy (balding with the mustache)absolutely freaking horrible! He was so stiff and forced it was embarrassing. As for Laura(Marty Wisher)I agree with the other comment (after seeing her website) referring that she is living in a fantasy world if she thinks she can act! Talk about vain!! Wannabes but never will be. I want MY money back as well.,0
"Stands Up to Use: I bought this knife because I bake lots of bread, especially crusty sourdough, and the knives I had didn't work well for cutting the crust without smooshing the bread. I've been using this inexpensively priced knife for about 2.5 years now, and it is still sharp and working as well as when I bought it. Although I use it mostly for bread, it is great for slicing things like tomatoes, extra thin slices of onion, tender things that can't be sliced easily with non-serrated knives unless they are very sharp. I could have spent a lot more money and doubt that I would have been any happier. This one is a great value and has stood up to the test of time.",1
"a must for water resource engineers and students: I took a hydrology course taught by one of the authors (Larry Mays) using this book. Advantages of this book lies in (1) the arrangement of the contents is very logic-oriented, you don't feel aburpt jump from one chapter to another one, (2) the theory addressed in the text is concise, easy to read and understand, (3) the examples used to illustrate the theories are very correlated. Other books may be good too, however, in terms of ""hydrology"" alone, I haven't seen a better one. It is a useful reference for your understanding of hydrologic design manual, creteria.",1
"Oral B replacement Heads: Purchased these items a few weeks ago. Already one head has fallen off and the second one is coming loose! These are somehow sub-standard or didn't pass quality control.

"Wow.....what a letdown!: I have read and re-read Rosemary's Baby often since the late 60's and love it. So I thought I'd explore more of Ira Levin's work, and figured a logical choice would be the sequel. This was one sequel where I really felt that he just slapped whatever story together to capitalize on the success of the original book. Didn't like the writing in this one, didn't like the story, was totally creeped out by parts of it (and not in a good, creepy atmosphere way like in the first book, more in an ""ewwwww"" sort of way). I finished it, hoping that maybe it would get better, but it let me down right up to the end. I haven't deleted it from my Kindle but I should because I won't be reading it again.",0

The picture of the vitamin jar is a little deceiving, but that doesn't affect the contents.It arrived quickly and intact.I use this to make face masks and mud washes- a must have if your hair is curly or if your skin is oily.

"Run Away!!: I agree 100% with the other reviewer. The cooking surface is not flat, so pancake batter all runs to the sides. EVERYTHING sticks to the surface, except oil. The heating is so uneven you have to shift everything constantly to keep from burning one side while the other stays raw. It is virtually impossible to cook with, and horrible to clean. I would rather cook with a hot rock over coals. The cooking surface would be just as level, and food certainly couldn't stick to the rock any worse. At least the heating would be more even.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",0
"floyd but not really floyd: This album is not so bad if only they came up with something original. As someone indicated earlier, the first side (for those who bought the LP more then 10 years ago) is not so bad. There is decent stuff like Learning to Fly and On the Turning Away. The rest is just forgettable drivel taking snippets of other ideas from their past albums and trying to market what people expect to be the ""floyd"" sound.The reason why people enjoy Floyd is because of their inventiveness and the lyrics. People also say ""Well, we don't need poets like Waters, what we need is music."" Just remember that an album is more than just it's packaging people.",0
"a slanted view of Southern poetry: The editor of THE MADE THING would have us believe that the University of Arkansas is the Mecca of Southern poetry and that a disporportionate number of the South's best poets go through that MFA program. It is clearly a partisan selection, omitting A> R> Ammons, Katherine Byer and George Scarbrough, while including not only unaccomplished poets like Ralph Adamo, but dead ones as well. What the editor was thinking probably has something to do with thorazine, but little to do with poetry. Was it ""poultry"" he had on his mind?",0

"All around great product: Have used many different lasers in the past few years between framing soffits and installing suspended ceilings and must say this is the best plumb/level laser that I have used. Set up is simple, either use the built in magnet to attach it to metal studs or a door frame or use the included wall angle clip. You dont have to worry about this laser falling off as the magnets are very strong and keep it where you put it. Easy single button on/off. Would absolutely recommend this laser to any profesional or even the avid do-it-yourselfer. Great price for an amazing product, everyone should have one of these in their toolbox. Battery life is also very good so you dont have to worry about shutting the laser off every time you walk out of the room.",1
"The foam is just plain hard: It is not memory foam (I have a memory foam pillow) and, if your legs are shorter than the pillow, the ""dip"" will leave your feet dangling (I am 5'5""--not extremely short). You can take the foam wedge out (hence the ""adjustable""), but it makes very little difference. How you would fit this under a blanket, I have no idea. Might as well just use pillows.Have just become aware that I have to send this back by post office for $28, due to it's bulkiness....make sure you want this thing before you buy it, because the seller does not pay for return postage!",0
"DON'T BUY THE DIRT DEVIL!: I should have read the reviews before I purchased the Dirt Devil. I had similar problems with the crevice tool, but the motor broke down before the tool had a chance to really make me crazy! It would start to whine like the RMP's were climbing into the red zone and a terrible burning smell would come out after a few minutes of use. I was so mad I just threw the whole thing away. Yesterday I bought Black and Decker's Dustbuster (7.2V) and am so much happier with it's performance.",0
"Essence of Christian Symbolism: The Four Gold Keys is the best book on Christian symbolism I have ever read. Clarke does not merely explain the symbolism. He shows how the symbols and archetypes of the individual and collective consciousness are meant to transform our lives, to individuate us into the types of spiritual heros described by Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. I recommend this book for those who desire to transform their lives for the better by using the wisdom hidden in the Christian mysteries.

A couple things I am very happy THQ put into this game is a full size Hell in a Cell. There will also be TLC, with this being the first game to have multiple ladders. Putting the nWo in at the last minute topped this game off.

"Great Movie, DVD is a lousy transfer: What a shame. Such a fun movie but the DVD is a lousy non-anamorphic transfer. Soft and fuzzy, most scenes have no blacks at all. Sound is fine.Save your money and don't buy the DVD. My guess is that the Blu-ray is much better. Buy it instead.",0
"An excellent advance in the way Arabic is taught: This textbook is designed to cover the first year of instruction in Modern Standard Arabic. It will teach students to read, speak, and write Arabic. The text also provides information about the geography of the Arab world, prominent characters in history, festivities in Arab culture, the media, daily life, and the family. Exercises in comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, and writing attend to both form and meaning and develop functional abilities and knowledge about the Arabic sound, writing, and language systems. The book needs an updating and it will be an excellent book. MOHAMED A ALSIADI,The State University of New jersey,RUTGERS .",1

"A Great Read!: 'Where Birds Don't Sing', the second book in Alan Clegg's trilogy is fantastic. The book is well-plotted and could be read as a stand-alone story but as it includes characters from 'Windmills' I would recommend that you read them in order if you can. Although this story is the second in the Dutch Holocaust triology and will appeal to readers interested in this subject matter it is also on a par with some of the best psychological thrillers I have read. The way in which the story moves from the present day to the past can sometimes be confusing but Alan Clegg has done a great job with it. It is gripping from start to finish and kept me intrigued all the way through - I can't wait to read the third book in the series. I recommend this book to you without any hesitation.",1
"No nonsense..no fluff: I haven't finished reading this yet, but from what I have read, this book is a must. Ms. O'Brien pulls no punches and tells it just how it is. It is down to earth and not full of the Fluff101 garbage that so proliferates the world of Pagan writings of all kinds. It is a great read, and I can't wait to finish so I can read it again. I have found a new book to recommend to people who are just starting out in the Craft or who just want to know more about Witchcraft. After reading this work there should be no mistaken perceptions or delusions. I also am so grateful for the proper pronunciations she provides of the gaelic language she uses throughout the book.",1

"Nice looking, but..: Watch is a bit larger than I thought. I have a thin, boney wrist, and removed the only two removable links on the bottom side of the face, but it still sits too far to the top side when clasped. Wish I could remove one more on the bottom side so it would be tighter. When the band moves on my arm it tends to catch hairs in the deep recess between the outer links. The center row of mirror-polished stainless steel links in the band get scratched in everyday wear. But... watch looks nice even though not totally comfortable. Quality of watch and crystal seems good.",1
"Too much...: This book starts off on a very biased footing, with an micro study of the author's favorite ranch, why he liked it, and what it represents (who cares!). He goes to the riduculous exercise of comparing it to other major world sites. If you survive this initial drag, you will be bored by very specific details about certain civilizations, only to arrive to the same conclusion...the weather did it!",0

Since I have an XBOX 360, I heard it's backwords compatible and this may be a good game to play for the XBOX 360. Atari should keep making DBZ games for the XBOX because it would be alot better if they did so Microsoft could be happy. Anyway so far this is one of the best(and only) Dragon Ball Z games around.",1

"Disappointed: I've read some long reviews, so I'll make mine short. I've been a fan of MGS since the original PS version. This is by far my least favorite. Although the graphics are stunning and there may be some pretty cool weapons, gameplay is not that good in my opinion.If you buy a video game to watch a story, then you'll love this version. If you actually want to play a game, stick with any number of titles other reviewers mentioned.I really wanted to like this game since I consider MGS and Gran Turismo to be the flagship PS titles, but MGS has been a let-down to say the least. Heck GT for PS3 has been a disappointment too, but that's another story.",0

"Good bargain for cleaner air!: I bought this little guy about 2 years ago for my husband & his allergies. About an hour after I plugged it in, I noticed a difference in the air quality. Our bedroom felt much cleaner than before. The dander & dust- gone! You will notice a fresher ""feeling"" when you use this plug mount air cleaner. You can buy replacement filters for this item, but I rinse the filter out, dry it, & use it again. Also, this air cleaner provides a very small amount of white noise- which we like when we're sleeping. Purchase with confidence. Strong enough for one room only.",1
"Constantly foul mouthed and thoroughly touching...: The combination is bizarre...and works beautifully. Try not to make any judgements in the first 15 pages; you'll be glad you did.The author did a great job of making me feel like I was reading a story from a thirteen year old boy from a working class family. It wasn't always comfortable, but I felt like I experienced his life and home. It was frequently funny, several times literally laugh out loud funny, and I came to care about the characters.The book is a little different and a lot good. If you can get beyond the parents and children regularly swearing (and other things) in front of each other and a boy who has boobs-on-the-brain, you'll find a whole lot more beneath the surface.",1
"Another Tiresome Politically Correct Diatribe: Apparently Martin Luther King disagreed...Yawn...Another tiresome politically correct diatribe written by someone who has clearly exhausted the possibilities inherent in writing essays on the homoerotic aspects of Gilligan's Island and the feminist subtext of Bewitched. Like most diatribes of it's kind, it hinges its indictment of Star Trek's racism on the most petty and ridiculous things and has no connection to reality but to the author's black and white version of reality. Star Trek fans should avoid this nonesense like the plague, while fans of academic essays on the Brady Bunch as a metaphor for Apartheid and the end of American nationalism will lap it up like spoiled chili.",0
"Sitting on top of the world!: This cd starts incredibly good with the first 5 songs. Let It Rain, Birmingham, Fall From Grace, and Dark Horse are great popsongs, but Beautifull Goodbye is defenitly the best song. The other songs are lovely to listen to but they don't have the inpact like the first songs I mentioned. All the songs have great lyrics (witch are not all written by Amanda), and all have a little story to tell. This is a very satisfying buy, and I recommend it to everybody who likes popmusic.",1
Faaaaaaaaaaaaaart: It makes fart noises. Constantly. It's a constant fart. Fart! Ever wondered what a fart sounds like? Wonder no more!!! This product is fart-mazing.,1
"Worth a shot: I've used this product twice ... once about ten years ago, and again recently. If your windshield has a small chip or ""starburst"" crack, this product is definitely worth a shot before you spend major money to replace the windshield.Pros:- The kit costs only about twelve bucks.- The repair takes only about an hour. Most of that time is really just waiting around ... ten minutes after one step, twenty minutes after another, and fifteen minutes after a third.- It works at least some of the time.- The repair seems to last. (The repair that I did ten years ago is still fine, even though the car isn't garage-kept and has been driven 150,000 miles in all sorts of weather. The jury's still out on the recent repair, but I have high hopes.)Cons:- It doesn't always work -- and even when it does, the repair isn't totally invisible.- The directions could be clearer.With improved directions (including color photos of the various steps) I would have given this five out of five stars.",1

"My favorite battery operated vibe: The price here is a little higher than I've seen elsewhere. I love this vibrator. Next to the Wahl Coil for clitoral stimulation and the pocket rocket for fun on the go, this one is a favorite. I don't find it flimsy, but it does have too many settings. I love the constant vibe with full power, but there are four other pulses offered and it is tricky to get back to the preferred setting once the new one is engaged. My current iflex vibrator has served me well. The batteries must be inserted properly and the back shut tight for the vibes to continue, which may explain why the other authors have been frustrated and complained of short life. If my husband didn't provide some technical help in this area I might be as frustrated as the others. I would love to see an updated version with improved button controls and more secure battery compartment.",1
"underinformed: I bought this item with great expectation of sitting out on my back patio with my laptop, surfing the web unincumbered by wires and modems. This after two months of trying, has turned out to be nothing but a fantasy. Not only is the system difficult to install, but I find that my DSL provider will not support any router that isnt supplied by them and therefore this whole system is now unusable. So beware consumer. Check with your provider to see if they can support the new hardware youre buying.",0
Confusing: I bought this book thinking it would be an easy in to the world of fun hypnotism. Not really. It's kind of hokey. I couldn't get through the first twenty or so pages. I will try again though (when I've got time).,0
"Satisfied: It's a hamster ball. not much to really be said. I enjoyed a bag of sample food (which my hamster, Nimbus, certainly appreciates) and fits nicely on the track i bought with it.A worth-while product.",1
"Doug Martsch is a genius!: Built to Spill are one of those very rare bands, they can make you laugh or cry. Songs such as ""Twin Falls"" and ""Cleo"" cover the crying part, and damn near everything else covers the joyous part. I'll admit to not really getting into Built to Spill until ""Keep It Like A Secret"" came out, but that album motivated to check out their back catalogue, especially after I saw them live on May 9, 1999 in Minneapolis. Anyone who does not give Built to Spill's earlier albums such as this and ""The Normal Years"" is doing a serious injustice to the world of indie-pop.",1
"Much better than Joey's: After buying and disliking Joey McIntyre's cd, I was a bit skeptical about Jordan's release. But once I read the review of Jordan's cd in Rolling Stone, I had to check it out and buy it today. Everyone will like this cd, whether you were a New Kids fan or not! Every song (except one) is great, especially Jordan's cover of the Prince hit ""I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man"". Backstreet, 'N Sync, and 98 Degrees Fans will like this cd!",1
"Steer Clear of this one!!!: What a piece of garbage. Not only is the steam barely hot enough to make you pull your hand away, it doesnt work well at all. They may show it blowing grime off that grill on TV, but I guarantee you someone had just painted it on only seconds before. It clogs, even after having used distilled water and you cant use common cleaning solutions like vinegar or CLR to unjam it. The only good part is that I got a canvas bag with it. I now use the bag to store products that actually work. Id throw this thing in the garbage, but I dont want to insult the waste disposal guy. Youre better off blowing the steam off the mouth of a regular tea kettle than you are using this thing. Total piece of garbage, and if I could give it less than one star I would.",0
"great book for people with a serious interest in Tokyo: Sorensen's book is a wonderful overview of the history of Tokyo (and Edo before it), from the point of view of the geographical and physical structure of the city and its development over time. The book should be read by anyone with a serious interest in the planning, architecture, or social history of Tokyo. Well illustrated with maps and plans many of which are not, to my knowledge, readily available to an English language audience elsewhere.",1

"Great collection of great songs: The range of the Temptations styles is covered in this album, and all the songs we love are on it. Worth the purchase!",1
"This textbook was completely androcentric.: Do not buy this book. Do not read this book. Instead, e-mail Harold R. Kerbo and tell him that women's place in social stratification deserves a little more than a few pages. Remind him that women are 50% of the United States population, and thus 50% of the United States Social Stratification system.",0
It was pretty good: This movie was pretty good. I didn't see the beginning but what i saw it was pretty cool. It also makes you feel so sorry for the guy in parts but Adam Sandler did a good job acting out this movie.,1
"Blasting Techno Music Ruined It: I wanted to sit back, and feel as if I were on these great rides. Instead, they made the ridiculous decision to add loud music to the rides. There are two main senses involved (besides the body feel - which of course they can't supply) . . . sight and sound. You want to hear the wheels whirring, the air rushing by, the screams and the silence at the top of the first hill. Instead, you hear track after track of thighmaster Infomercial music. That destroyed the experience. Take out the music, and this would have ""rocked"" !!",0
"Fallacious, Sensationalized, Exaggerated...: It is clear that Robbins formulated her conclusions before beginning her ""research."" Her ability to tell the truth is severely hampered by her desire to sell books, and the sensationalized story that results is one that makes for great drama, but is a far from accurate depiction of reality. She stultifies the Greek system by seeking merely to perpetuate a stereotype of licentious behavior. In a nationwide Greek system, one can undoubtedly find any sought after ""truth."" The fallacy in Robbins' conclusion is that she applies such ""truths"" to the entire system. The nationwide Greek system is much larger, and more diverse, than the small sample she chose to experience. This ""expos√©"" reveals two truths: Robbins lacks objectivity and serious fact-finding ability.",0

"No More Pre Orders????: And yes this does deserve a 1 star review! Amazon and MPI just made this set near impossible to get now... Been tring to save the money to get this set cuz the original box sets would of cost over 1000 dollars. When I saw this set come up for $420 on Amazon I knew I had to start saving up for it... But because MPI made this a limited edition box set and only at 2000 units. They are now actually going to lose money instead of gaining. If they were goi9ng to sell more, more people would buy it... It's insane...",0
Nice: I really enjoyed making personalized stamps with my kids on these! Shipped very fast as well. We are using them already!,1
"Great soundtrack with bonus DVD!: The music is great, as you'd expect from Star Wars. However, what really sets this appart is the bonus DVD that has music-videos of around 6 star wars songs. The DVD includes intros and comments from Anthony Daniels (C3PO). I purchased this for the DVD alone, it's a great buy.",1
Great documentary!: I really enjoyed this and I think anyone with an interest in this subject would appreciate and enjoy it as well.,1

"She's still doing well!: This is Catherine Simone's third book describing her battle with Interstitial Cystitis. In this one, she lets her readers know that she is still doing great but addresses spiritual, emotional, and mental issues that can attribute to/stem from the disease. Many people who have recovered are finding that although the physical symptoms are gone, the fear, anxiety, etc., tend to linger. This book perfectly complements her other two, bringing her work full circle. I am so thankful for this book...an excellent resource for every IC patient.",1
"Be Patient: A lot of people have been complaining that this new box set contains two movies (the last two) that aren't particularly good. Although this is true, be patient. In January, Fox will offer the movies individually. There's no way I am going to have Alien3 in my house, so I'm going to wait until then. Too bad they didn't release these versions in the first place, but we all know that studios will release as many versions of a given movie as is possible.",0
"very enjoyable and interesting: I bought this because a friend had a copy. I found the story of a life on Snith Island, to be interesting and accurate. It provides insight to the hardships of Island living around the Cheasapeake Bay. Some of the recipes are deliciousand Mrs' Kitching's is a real person from the island. Very enjoyable!",1
Great Cards: I got the cards home and tryed them out. They worked perfictly and they dont look like I printed them at home. When you do get these cards make sure you go to Avery's site nd get the free software. It will make you whole life easer because the software is made to work with all their prodects.,1
"Simply Not Good!: I was told about this book from watching a documentary entitled Sex: The Secret Gate to Eden. The documentary is clearly more worthwhile than this book. This book is written by a strange and mentally unstable man. The ideas, more specifically Gnosticism, do fascinate me and are even believeable. But just a quick read through this book, or any of the author's others for that matter, will have you putting it down quickly. Skip it and watch the documentary as mentioned above. If you're still not convinced look this guy up on Wikepedia.",0
Insightful and Concise!: I'm having difficulty trying to type what I would like for someone to know about this book. I read the reviews of books before I purchase them too and know they have some influence. What if I just say that your dollar and time investment are low and your yield is gigantic? Reading this has brought me to a deeper understanding of God's nature and has brought me back to the Bible as a source of this understanding.Please read this book.,1
"Thankfully, a fading memory.: To the fan from USA - this not an ""awesome"" CD, rather it was a display of some of the worst music and behavior ever forced on the American public. Great music stands the test of time. These recordings, thankfully, are finally fading into the past. In my opinion, they can't disappear fast enough.",0
"Disappointment to me: Had previously owned Broadway cast version on LP. Compared to that recording, songs on this one have less life and exhuberance, or are overproduced. If Amazon posted samples of ""Hair"", ""Where Do I Go"" or ""I Got Life"" or some others, you could hear the overproduction (more chorus and orchestra, less spirit from the singer). I bought this CD because of the great reviews on Amazon for this version and accusations of bad production quality for the Broadway cast version CD. This one also has a lot of non-musical dialog, which hurts the musical flow. I played this one once and haven't played it since. I'll go get the version I grew up with.",0
The adventures of super diaper baby: This book is awesome!My favorite part was when the doctor spanked the baby and the baby flew out of the window!,1
"wow!: My first impression of NoFX's new album was: thumbs up. There weren't any tracks that I felt the need to skip through (except for maybe the random Spanish song). I also think that the lyrics are really well-written - you definately get a dose of good quality NoFX-style-satirical-antiAmerica-that's-so-true humour in this one. My favourite track has to be the hilariously ironic Leaving Jesusland. The bonus of buying this album is that you get a free sample CD of other Fat Wreck Chords bands (I'm not sure if they all come with this, but anyways). You get a generous 16 tracks of pretty good songs...even though some struck me as a little screamo-emo at first, but I'll give them another listen. Overall, make sure you read through the lyrics to get the full experience from this album. NoFX fans will be pleased with this one.",1

"Amazing photographs and investigation: Luis Poirot is one of my favorites photographers. This book about Pablo Neruda is great, not only for the quality of the beatiful images, but also for the investigation with the people who knew Neruda well.Absolutamente recomendable!!!!",1
"Needs more: I just finished reading this book over the weekend. Granted, the overall plot was interesting enough to keep me reading until the very end. Perhaps, I thought the book would get MORE interesting as I read on. Much to my dismay, it didn't. For one thing, as many other reviewers have pointed out, there was little character development. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters...except maybe the poor dog, Lorelei. I found Lexy to be quite an annoying person and did not see HOW Paul would have wanted to be with someone like her to begin with. I thought the book was predictable and poorly executed. The author wrote in the voice of a man but with a heart of a woman. The relationship she imagined between the two characters seemed so unreal I couldn't connect with them. I guess I was hoping it would turn out to be another ""Lovely Bones."" If you have to pick between this book or ""Lovely Bones"" and have not read either one, read ""Lovely Bones.""",0
"This is a great product: This product is wonderful and easy to use. It has saved me time and money. I used to order checks from my bank but I no longer have to with Versacheck. I just print them as needed from my computer. Checks can be customized with pictures and logos to fit your needs. It's great!I do need to add that I have had a little trouble cashing these checks at some stores with electronic processing, and there is an inconvenience factor to not having checks bound to a book. However, I havent had any problems paying bills.",1
"Excellent read: Hughes has created an original PI, and his writing is like poetry. The Wrong Kind of Blood will not disappoint his growing fan base. It is full of humanity as well as a wicked sense of humor and is a true page-turner of a book. It is also written with style must writers fail to achieve in twice the number of pages.",1
"Worth having as a handy slim reference: At first I didn't see the need for this black and white spiral bound guide,because Olympus provides a detailed manual on its CD-ROM with the camera. On the other hand, there are so many things to recall as an owner,that it is handy to have the Curtin slim volume at hand for reference. It covers all the must-have information. The more obscure stuff is with the Olympus CD in a stuffier verbage. The Curtin CD combo adds only color pictures,but it is probably worth getting and saving to your hard drive. I like the author's no nonsense approach and clear writing style. For less price than a small 64 meg flash card,it is a reasonable enough investment in this day and age. Wish it had more pages though and more details on the camera and its myriad capabilities.",1
Wonderful as is usual for Kerry Greenwood: Five star because all of Kerry Greenwood's Phryne Fishermysteries are great reading! Love having them available onthe Kindle!,1
Wonderful read!: Wonderful read! Could not put it down. I am always looking for my reading club's latest book and this really fit the order. Greatly anticipating the author's next two books of the trilogy.,1
needs detail in the description: If you want me to buy your product first let's compare apples to apples. Where is the description detail? The size would be a very important piece of information for me to have to consider purchasing this item.,0
Great starter kit!: Comes with everything to start learning to play. Everything is informative and useful. Guitar looks stunning. Only complaint are cheap strings. Broke one tuning. Luckily there is an extra set in this bundle.,1
"Good enough to make indie snobs mad: Everytime a somewhat popular indie band makes a hugely successful and critically acclaimed album (TMAA), all of their snobby fans get mad at the follow up, if its not exactly the same. This album is very catchy, has great lyrics and shows a real progression over the last album. They sound very influenced by the Flaming Lips, which is a good thing. Hopefully after another 10 years MM will be as good as Flaming Lips. We can only hope - but based on this album they will be.",1
"Great Starting Point: If You can't afford the hundreds of dollars to purchase or the hundreds of hours to peruse the entire Talmud, this book is for you. It is well constructed with key passages referenced and in most case the most prominent teachings have been explained thoroughly. It is, however, a readers digest version of the complete ancient work and some areas of thought are left lacking. I am just beginning my exegetical study of this book and have found it quite enlightening thus far...I look forward to my time of study in it regularly as I use it to supplement my study of the ancient Holy Scriptures, the Bible.",1
"freedom is priceless: Must be seen/should be seen by young and old alike--especially by those who take freedom and democracy for granted.Intelligently written and directed. Authentically portrayed.Want to have some idea what it was like for the average citizen to exist in East Germany under Commie rule?A living hell. Your worst nightmare.See this film. Tell others about it.Director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck (believe me, I've had to consult--repeatedly--the box art the DVD came in order to get the spelling right) is a film director who ought to be saluted.",1
"What do you want for 15 bucks?: I bought this light for work, and have used and purchased other rechargeables in the past. But this light is dim. 2 Million Candlepower? Yeah, right.

"Defective Disc (Bourne Identity) in Trilogy: As another poster has stated (September 13 2012), the Bourne Identity disc freezes in the Sony BDP BX59 which is the same as the BDP S590. The only way to get out of the ""freeze"" is to unplug your Bluray player. The other two discs play OK. I'll now be returning this box set to Amazon and buying each disc separately. I saw the movies originally in the theaters, and of course, the movies themselves are excellent. The one star rating is only because one third of this trilogy is defective.UPDATE: October 1, 2012This update is to mention that Amazon was extremely prompt in it's superb return process. I'm still leaving the rating at one star because it's for the item purchased. I would give five stars to Amazon for their execution of their return policy.",0
A good easy read: I like the character and her everyday ways. It was not one that I could not put down but still entertaining and will next the next book in the series. The book is overall enjoyable and an easy read.,1
"Worked great for a year then stopped working: I hadn't bothered to check other reviews until today. My machineworked beautifully for about a year and then the problems began.Drip too slow, coffee tastes subpar, etc. I tried cleaning andall the other ""remedies"" suggested in the manual, but nothinghelped. Going to try another espresso maker. I guess you getwhat you pay for.",0
"Misleading title: This was purchased to obtain the maps of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. The AT is administrated and owned by the National Park Service, If so, then why is it not included in this map set?Had I known this I would not have purchased this set of CDs. The description did not indicate that that 2175 mile long trail was not included.",0
"Another Awesome Sci-Fi Series comes to DVD!!: I watched ""Buck Rogers"" as a kid in the 70's and being able to see them again uncut and in broadcast order as when they first aired on NBC is a treat!!! I am only midway through the first year and everything has been great thus far!!This show really brings back a lot of great memories for me as well.A great show for any science fiction fans out there. I highly recommend!",1
"an absolute must read: This book is brilliant and so is Steve Grand!Using synthetic approache of complexity theory, Steve Grand goes on to describe his first attempt at really making something intelligent. The beings from his game Creatures are made out of simulated neurons and chemicals, that come together in an attempt to simulated real intelligence.With great wisdom and wit, without wasting a word, in 200 pages Steve Grand does what volumes of books and scientists fail to do - do something, create, get somewhere. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in complex systems & ai. This is how Godel, Escher, Bach moves from philosophy to practice.",1
"Hope, In this Book: With this book, Christopher Reeve brought to light the necessity of medical advances without the need of a world war to prompt one. Have we not learned form history? Or, are we still the same old prehistoric creatures? I believe that we have truly come a long way and certainly quite capable of making decisions that could possibly help people in the future. Stop watching Sci Fi freak horror shows and start visiting hospitals where reality lays, in a bed without a functioning limb, degenerate organs, and countless other medical conditions that can be resolved through stem cell research. Christopher Reeve delivers humanity, as it should have always been recognized. He delivers a dream held by so many people and it is up to humanity to preserve humanity and not to let our differences, whether physical or mental, polarize and fracture us.",1
"Leslie Rocks!: If you like bands such as Mountain, The Animals or The Rolling Stones, you'll probably like this Album. Of course Leslie West was one of the founders of Mountain. Mick Jagger actually plays on this album which features a nice cover of Honky Tonk Woman and House of the Rising Sun.I owned the Great Fatsby in college and was thrilled to find it available on CD. Try it, you'll like it.",1
"Ink rubs off on my child's skin!: We've used Huggies for ages and they were always the solid white ones with one small image in the front and (I think) a second very small image in the back. We signed up for the subscribe-and-save and every box is now this new version of the diapers -- it has blue and green circles all over it, even between the legs. I could completely care less what the diaper looked like, except that this ink rubs off all over my daughter's thighs! She looks like she has massive bruises! It doesn't come off easily either. I'm so disappointed Huggies! I'm canceling this subscribe-and-save and I guess I'll move over to Pampers.",0
Absolutely Worthless Movie: How hard can it be to make a so-so movie? How hard can it be to make a really bad movie? This movie excelled at being bad. This was the absolute worst movie I have seen in quite a long time. I only watched it because it had Bruce Willis in it. Why he did he do this movie (was he blackmailed? Did he have a stroke? Did he want to do one really absolutely bad movie before he died?) I do not know. I will be cautious about any of his movies in the future. An absolute waste of viewing time.,0
"Disappointed.: After having read Vinegar Hill, I was looking forward to reading Midnight Champagne but was disappointed. The story did not appear organized and was difficult to follow. The character development was vague. I wouldn't recommend this book to friends.",0
"Turning Point: Like most people who have enjoyed the music of Brooks & Dunne, it was Ronnie Dunne's voice that first attracted me to the music. However, something has been happening with the last few CD's that has finally worked its way into my consciousness. I love Kix Brooks' voice and the songs he writes and sings!! My favorite songs from this current fine CD are ""When We Were Kings"" and ""Till My Dying Day."" The warmer and more expressive Kix's voice sounds to me, the colder and more brittle Ronnie's sounds. Sorry Ronnie fans and most critics (who, after all, are just listeners with a commericial outlet for their opinions), but there you have it. What kept this CD from getting five stars instead of four from me was too much Ronnie and not enough Kix!!",1
"Another awesome Schimmel book: As a long time Schimmel fan, I was quite surprised, and delighted to see a pop-up book of his work. It is more beautiful than I could have imagined. Each picture combines several of his works, and since it is a pop-up book, his art almost comes alive.If you are a Schimmel fan or just love animals you will not regret getting this book.",1
"Very unhappy: I have owned this planer for a year. It does fine on softwood but gives me a constant fit in feeding any kind of hardwood over 6 inches wide. The feeding is TERRIBLE! The outfeed tables are poorly designed and do NOT stay in place, especially since you have to push & pull on them to move it. The vibration is a constant problem with loosening of bolts and setscrews, and the noise can literally be heard 1/2 a mile away. The maintenance is anything but simple. I wish I had bought a Delta!",0
Read for Class Assignment: Anton Chekov is such an interesting man. Most of his stories were first drafts. I can't imagine! As an author it's always a good idea to know our literary history.,0
"Powerful and Romantic: Wonderful period drama/romance. It reminded me of Far From the Madding Crowd mixed with a dash of Pride & Prejudice - all set in rural early 20th Century Ireland. Mossie Sheehan is every inch the devoted Gabriel Oak; and when he hunts down and returns the silly step-daughter who has run off with a lover, it's reminiscent of Darcy's search and delivery of Lydia. That said, it isn't a five-star series. The wigs are horrific. Elizabeth settles a little too easily and quickly into the role of mother (particularly to another woman's children) and adjusts a little too happily into rural life for a woman who was raised in the city as solicitor's daughter. But all faults are forgiven on my part when Mossie Sheehan declares his love - twice (sort of). My knees buckled and I had to get a drink of water to recover my senses. All in all, the most romantic series I've seen in a long while (not counting Gaskell's incomparable North & South). You won't be disappointed.",1
Great style: The shoes are very comfortable while having a funky young look. My only warning is mine fit small. A 10 was too tight for me in the toe. I would recommend a half size bigger then you normally wear.,1
"OWL PAPER CLIPS #3: I have tried to locate these paper clips locally, but could only find #2 paper clips, which is a smaller version. These clips are excellent to use where a paper clip is needed.They hold fast, unlike regular paper clips, as well as hold more sheets of paper. I am very glad that Amazon carries this product or should I say, allows me access to a supplier that can supply me with this product. I certainly recieved fast delivery from GEM and the item was well packed.",1
"Best backpack ever: I don't normally write these reviews, but I have to say this is the greatest piece of luggage I have ever owned. I bought it several years ago as a backpack for a once-in-a-lifetime trip. I abused it non-stop for several months, and completed depended on its compartments to carry all of my worldly possessions. That said, there was absolutely no damage to it - I swear if I could clean it up a bit the store would have taken back from me, convinced it had never been used. Since then, Ive taken this bag on a good number of extended trips (urban/tourist backpacking - not the wilderness kind) with the same result. I have several friends who regular borrow this bag from me as well, because they know how awesome it is. The only complaint some people (mostly women) have is the size - it's not the largest bag out there, but I like that :)",1
poor: The cable I received would not fit into any of the recepticals on the camera. It was not the correct cable.,0
"Perfect for Running: I bought these because in earbuds won't stay in my ears while running. These headphones stay on while running, they are lightweight, comfortable, sturdy, and perfect for my purpose.",1
"The dumbest book I have ever almost read.: The subject is just meditation, but you don't find this out until after many wasted hours of difficult reading. Waste of time and money, in fact I wouldn't read this thing if it was free from the library.",0
This author doesn't get it...: It is clear that this author is extremely one-sided and does not get the complexities of the issues at hand. ALL relationships are two-sided and these relationships only present one side of the coin.If the author really believes what she has written then it will be obvious to all readers why she does not get along with her daughter-in-law. She is an EXPERT in how not to get along!,0
"get what you pay for: The adapter did not have a spring loaded tip like pretty much all other car adapters do, which is probably why it took some fiddling to get the adapter to make contact with the socket and provide power. If it was moved slightly, power would cut out and it would need to be adjusted again. Also, the fuse recently burnt out on mine and can't really be replaced. It's cheap and works technically, but unless you only need one for one weekend, spend your money on something built a little better.",0
"A great read!: I absolutely loved the action, characters, and story line of this book. I want MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS! The characters really come alive, and the interaction between the hero and heroine is very real to me. I can FEEL the love between them. Definitely one for my permanent library so I can reread it often.",1
"bad reviews skew rating against something great: i love joy division (have 8 cds) and i love means to an end. i think any real fan will enjoy hearing these versions. the first reviewer is right, low's version of transmission alone makes this worth having.",1
home work hand built shelter: This book is such a rip. Anybody could duplicate this book by searching through the internet.It is no more than a series of pictures. There is no construction method or anything like that.If you are looking for a book with pictures of different types of homes this is it. But remember it is not much more than pictures.,0

"Karenga is a chump: If you really want to educated yourself about the history of Black America I suggest you read BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER, A PEOPLES HISTORY OF THE US, BLACK HISTORY: FOR BEGINNERS, and various others. No only does this self-proclaimed ""teacher"" have no writing skills but because of his own egotism and jealously, members of the Black Panther party were murdered (by bald headed Karenga cronies in the US Party) and jailed. This house boy has no business writing about black history when he turned on other blacks during one of the most important periods of our struggle for civil rights and self-defense. Read TASTE OF POWER, read anything by Angela Davis...read the back of a cereal box before you read anything by this PUNK.",0
"Snoozefest. Not the slick, racy film I expected: Big letdown. Slow as molasses. Uptight, unattractive, middle-aged British woman goes to the French countryside to write her next novel. Sneers at her housemate (her publisher's teenage daughter), who's a bit rebellious and sleeps with some of the ugliest men I've ever seen. Spends a lot of time looking out the window at the swimming pool and wandering around in an drab granny nightgown and brown slippers. The daughter wasn't even pretty. Beautiful scenery, but story was quite uncompelling. Yawn.",0
"It's as if James Dobson wrote an evolutionary book: Stick with Daniel Dennett, this book, is nothing more than conjecture. Look I love evolutionary theory, I see nothing but beauty coming from an appreciation of human life and origins. But when a writer is insistent upon using research that is politically motivated-not by science-than that person has a problem.It is evident that, Gilbert, is still bitter about his divorce, and this shown in his view on women. It would have done his book a great service and he researched Leonard Shlains work on women in the evolutionary time scale, instead of reading what researchers from the American Enterprise Insitute have to say on the matter-remember, AEI, are the folks partly responsible for our military adventure in Iraq-So don't waste your money on this book, I have a copy that you might find outside in a dumpster if you are ever down in San Diego",0
"This is the orig cast from 1935. Not what I was hoping for!: The music features Ethel Waters Mabel Mercer, Todd Duncan ... from the broadway cast in the 30'. I was hoping for the mostion picture sound track in the 60's with Sammy Davis Jr., Pearl Baily, Dorthy Dandridge, ... This was very disapointing for me.",0
"Greater Understanding: The bible is packed full of people who experienced God speaking through dreams. God is the same yesterday, today and forever right? So He still speaks to people through dreams. This book is a great help in pointing to the scripture when seeking greater understanding for our dreams. Alot of people I've came into contact with have recommended this book. After purchasing I also highly recommend this book. Great bibically based reference material.",1
"beware!!!: Beware that this item comes without a cord, so if you are like my boyfriend who lost the whole thing, why would you want to buy a stand that you can't plug into the wall? Also if you go on small appliances website they are giving another stand there that fits braun 7526, that is a little more expensive, and this one supposedly only fits two models (the numbers are available on amazon.com page of this item). So we can only trust Mr. Cooper who tagged this item as fit for 7526 model. By the way the cord will cost you another $18.99 +6.99 shipment, and there you are looking at $76.00, where if you add 30-40 $$ you can buy a new system on sale in CVS or somewhere else...!!! Think for yourselves people!!! I am dissappointed and I m going to send this item back, and I refuse to pay for the cord separately!!!",0
"Authentic soul and passionate disco: This falls short of being a Best Of by the mighty soul voice Patti Labelle. It nevertheless contains some of her greatest disco and soul hits like the dance classic Music Is My Way Of Life, torch masterpieces like I Don't Go Shopping and Come What May, and the majestic uptempo Lady Marmalade with its raucous French chorus which was considered rather risque way back in the seventies. Her gritty soul is immaculately expressed in tuneful dance numbers like Joy To Have Your Love and passionate ballads like You Are My Friend. Although incomplete, having been first released many years ago, this is an enjoyable album of R&B; classics. I also recommendGonna Take a Miraclewith Laura Nyro andNightbirdsby the group Labelle.",1
"More please.: This release is the most welcome of all releases of recent years. Extras on DVDs usually hold very little interest for me. I am usually interested only in sseing the films. However, this set includes some of the best commentary ever presented on a DVD by one of the most knowledgeable people in the business. People have actually complained about the musical accompaniment on this set. The fact that these forgotten gems are even available is cause for celebration. Special thanks to Kit Parker Films, , Richard Roberts, Phil Carli and David Drazin for making this the top video release of the last 20 years. I eagerly await volume 2 of ""Weiss O Rama"" because I am sure it will be as good as this volume.",1
"junk: I order this heart rate monitor for my forerunner 301. It appeared to be brand new out of the packaging and I am sure it was, however, it does not work. It could be a dead battery, who knows, the bottom line is that it should have worked. Now I have this useless piece of equipment. I would buy a battery for it but I can't because I am in Afghanistan. The CR2032 battery required is not sold out here.",0
"Love GO AWAY!!!Please: Alright now Larenz Tate is an excellent actor, but this movie is not worth applying towards his credits. The story line could have been good, but the way they unfolded this story line was boring!!!!!!Deborah Cox is an extraodinary singer and the little bits that you hear in this movie is the best part of the movie. Now this should have been a made for t.v. movie, because the little nude scenes could have been omitted and the few cuss words were not necessary either. I wish Larenz Tate had scrapped this movie and went back to the drawing board and started over. Sorry, not a good dvd.",0
"Mystery and a touch of the Irish countryside: Being a fan of all things Irish, I truly enjoyed this foray into the Irish countryside, with a bit of a mystery thrown in. The book was well written and captured the beauty and history of a small Irish village. I wouldn't call it a page turner, but it mixed in interesting characters with a subtle murder plot. It is a worthwhile read and I look forward to more novels from Ms. Hart.",1
Love this iron!: This is a great flat iron. Works great and quickly. It arrived in plenty of time for Xmas. This was the first time I used Amazon.com and I'm very happy!,1
"The one chapter I've read is wonderful: I am SO glad that I got this book. Wayne Grudem is such an intelligent man, but he write about amazingly complex ideas so that I can understand them. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to study Christian theology. One thing: don't expect to read it very fast. I read a few pages a week (and read them several times for greater understanding).",1
"Prince of poo poo: This game is way over rated!!!! camera problems, fighting control problems, and hyped up way too much!!! after reading reviews i expected the best game ever and now I feel robbed!! honestly i had more fun, actually WAY MORE FUN on the gameboy advance version!! with this title hope for the best , expect the worst...",0
"Fantastic bargain: Received this product in 5 days, free shipping and put it right to work. In less than an hour, I cleared a path through the woods in my back yard which had been blocked by a huge 4 inch thick branch since last year. The saw works perfectly, and hardly used any oil. I kept checking the chain tension like the manual suggests, but it needed no tightening during the entire first use. It comes apart easily for cleaning and goes back together just as easily. I can't wait to use it again.",1
"Yeah well, I was kind of dissapionted.: The music on the soundtrack is SOOO good. It is one of the best musicals I have ever heard really! But this music book is not so hot. It looks like someone just threw it together one day. The bass clef usaully just has one note on it for a whole measure! Some of the sections don't even sound like the real music. I was really sad because I like the music a lot. The songs are in the right key, but the accompanyment is not worth the money, unless you plan on adding in your own chords.",0
Love it!: My son loves anything Thomas so this is a hit in our house. It rolls smoothly on his tracks and works well with the other trains. LOVE IT!,1
"A fascinating hybrid of organic and electronic textures: Flanger find the middle ground between the classic-jazz textures of Amon Tobin and the twitchy, molecular electronic emissions of Oval and Pole. The rhythms aren't bracing; languid would be a better word. A solid, innovative record in a genre that is sounding increasingly homogenous.",1
"Waste of money.: The idea that everyone can just go out and purchase 10 rental properties for $45,000 each is absurd. Where is the author living in never land?",0
"Evaporative spider gear: Worked perfectly well and was easy to install. The old, worn out gear was very difficult to remove due it seizing to other parts. Once the bad, old gear was removed, the installation was easy. So far, it has worked a complete summer. I am very pleased.",1
"Reliable storage.: Eight years ago, I started out with Lexar based on a number of recommendations. I subsequently bought several more Lexar cards and in all that time, I have never lost an image. That first 16MB Lexar still works fine. Other brands may cost less and may work just as well, but my images are too important for me to tempt fate.",1
"Smart shift in music style.: When I heard Gwen Stefani was turning solo I couldn't care less. No Doubt was all about Gwen anyways. It would be the same alternative rock album and it would do wee on the chart.Uh-huh. I was wrong. She follows her true-self. She is now disco diva! This album is truely full of fun and entertaining tunes and that's what this album is all about. Super entertaining!key tracks would be;3. Hollaback Girl - fun track with simple thumping beats.4. Cool - Very ordinary pop song, and she sound beautiful in this track.5. Bubble Pop Electric - The most entertaining song you'll ever hear. Filled with very fast and tense beats, and you can hear sound of bubble! My favorite song.7. Harajuku Girls - My second favorite song. It talks about her love for Japanese street fashion and it's really funny when real Japanese girls' voice is heard in the song.",1
"Can't Do It!: Now I can forgive another MC for sounding like another MC. Sometimes cats voices are just similar. But I can't forgive GB for using the exact same cadence as Biggie. Same pauses, flow, mannerisms, clothes, and everything. I refuse to buy it on that alone. First Shine, and now GB. When is it gonna stop? Let the brutha rest in peace!",0
"not worth buying: i haven't played a lot of pokemon games, but out of the ones i have, this is probably the worst. first of all, the fact that you can only play as pikachu gets a little old. most racing games have an abundance of characters to choose from. mix it up a little. second, making pikachu run is not fun at all. instead of using the d-pad, you're forced to use the stylus. and that's fine, aside from the fact that you're literally scraping the stylus over and over and over across the screen and you have to keep doing it till the race is over (or you're in the hot air balloon...which i still don't understand). i bought this used at gamestop and had to return it. if you like pokemon games, skip this one.",0
"One of my favorites: This movie is great for all ages..if you are truly a kid, or just a kid at heart. The message is great.",1
"Read something else: Arthur Phillips created an awesome plot for his novel, but trying to read it at times was like pulling teeth. Normally once I pick a book up I can't bring myself to put it down... this book however, i couldn't bring myself to keep reading even whe i was bedridden for three days with nothing else to do.The theory behind this plot was amazing, but the story-line was way too convoluted, and the huge twist was entirely too predictable. I physically reading a book and flipping back and forth between chapters, but the only way I could finish this novel was by listening to the audio book.",0
Dumb: I figured it would be alot better... when I received it it was smashed flat! all white powder covered the cigar! This was a piece of junk! But for only about 2 dollars... I don't know what I wanted to exspect,0
"Depends on what you want: Read the negative reviews carefully. If you intend to play this thing using the remote, beware. Via the remote, it is only capable of playing one CD, no sequential. I'm extremely dissatisfied with it, but otherwise, it is a handsome machine, and if you only need one CD played or intend to play it by touching buttons on the console itself (instead of the remote) this may be for you. The support call center was not especially helpful.",0
"Autism is No Excuse: Wow. What a chore. My wife recommended it so I began reading it. 50 pages in I put it down. The short, choppy senteneces, the long, pointless tangents, and plodding story were too much for me to bear.Next thing I know my brother is recommending the book. His taste is usualy impeccable so I give it another shot. Same problems as before. this time however, I forced myself to finish it hoping against hope something, ANYTHING would make the experience enjoyable. No dice.Using the mentally challenged kid as narrator obviously worked for some - not for me.",0
"This was certainly different....: I've seen a lot of movies on ""Jack the Ripper"", but this one certainly was different because it was so gorry. Johnny Depp and his co-star was excellent in this film. I was so enrossed in this film., I missed making popcorn or eating any lunch. The scenes in White Chapel took care of my appetite.One thing that impressed me about this movie is that it was so accurate right down to the cockney accent of the street walkers. Most of the movies based on this character were white washed in some way. More than just the real ""Jack the Ripper"" was missing.I only recommend this movie to people with strong stomachs.",1
"What happened!: Ok all I have to say for this review is that MR's first cd was way better than this one. I dont know what happened to them. The lyrics are dull, the instrument makeup is nothing new. I do give credit to the guitarists, they have improved but I dont hear anything else that is appealing to me. I had my hopes set way too high for this cd. I am sad to say that I'm disappointed.",0
"A most disappointing ""biography"" about the British capital: This weighty tome about the life of the city of London was a massive disappointment, and a grueling and nearly impossible book to read. It isn't a biography in the linear sense, rather it is a collection of short chapters about different aspects of the city throughout its history, including its rivers, churches, theatres, and outcasts. Each chapter consists mainly of quotes from other sources, and its lack of narrative flow makes for an exceptionally dry and thoroughly unrewarding read, which reminded me of an 800 page essay written by a college freshman. Anyone brave enough to tackle this book is advised to read it in tiny segments, or, as I did, skim the book to read the most interesting sections.",0
"Fire boots: My sons totally loved these boots the only problem is they ripped apart at the toes and the sides of the front of the boot. We tried fixing them but, it didn't hold and the boots had to be trashed. This was very upsetting due to the cost and the disappointment to my boys. I am looking for other boots to purchase that will hold up to the everyday wear and tear of boys.",0
"Terror let down: I got my hopes all up for this album to be hot, but it's a load of crap. its horrible! Maybe only two songs on this cd are worth listening to. I do not recommend buying this cd unless you won't mind wasting your money.",0
"WRESTLEMANIA XI-NOT WORTH THE ANTICIPATION: It was rather disappointing to see WrestleMania go weak for its eleventh installment. Perhaps the first ridiculous WrestleMania. The highly anticipated match between Bam Bam Bigelow and the NFL's Lawrence Taylor was the biggest upset of the night as LT pulled up a victory over Bigelow. WrestleMania XI should be recognized, however, as one of the few WrestleManias in which the WWF title did not change hands. Not all is disappointing about WrestleMania XI. Bret Hart pulled up an amazing victory over WWF legend Bob Backlund.",0
"Rosalia De Souza - Garota Moderna: The handiwork of Nicola Conte is all over Rosalia De Souza's debut album, Garota Moderna. There are plenty of Italian jazz flourishes over the tracks, sprinkled on generously like freshly grated Parmesan cheese over a steaming bowl of pasta. De Souza's voice is light and gentle, perfectly suited to the quick and easygoing rhythms that Conte lays down for her. A few tracks, like ""Saudosismo,"" go for a more relaxed attitude, rather than for a samba. A little more than half the tracks are remakes, but Conte shows that he's comfortable arranging others' tracks for maximum enjoyment. Garota Moderna is irrepressibly sunny, from ""Bossa 31"" to the beach-ready ""Ipanema."" Plenty to enjoy here!",1
"cheap ""wood"", chipped finish...not worth the money: While the dresser looks nice once it is put together, I was not impressed with the quality of craftsmanship. The dresser is particle board with a very thin wood topping; it cracks and falls apart when things are screwed together. The finish had splotches that were not painted and some areas were noticeably darker than others. I'm a little worried the dressed won't hold up for long and it definitely wont hold up if it ever needs to be moved from this house. Overall, my husband and I thought it was a cheaply made furniture with an over inflated price. I guess that's what we get for trying to buy a dresser that was a little less money than others.",0
"No control: The DVD main story was ok. The issue I had was with the fact that I could not skip through the preview, I could not fast forward through the preview, and I could not select the menu while the preview was playing. In short, there was NO way to bypass the preview in ANY way. I did not have control of MY machine. The disk did. Based on this, in order to give hollywood a message that they their intrusion into YOUR viewing experience is not acceptable, don't BUY the disk. That is, if you support the view that the OWNER of the DVD player and disk should be in complete control of the viewing experience. If you want it, get it some other way.",0
Poor debut; dont buy this if your new to them: Eyehategod are a great band; if you buy this as your first title by them you'll get a poor reflection of their ability. Recommended for... well pretty much nobody. Even die-hard EHG fans will probably not find much for them.Get Dopesick and Take as needed... both those efforts are sludge at it's dirtiest.,0
"Wrong Season but possibly better: Funny, in reference to Season 4, when I downloaded Season Three from Amazon on March 12 and 13. I got Season 4 episodes instead. They were labelled with the titles to Season 3 but the episode did not match the file names, I enjoyed Season 4.",1
Poorly written book: We do not have currently enough gold and enough proven reserve of gold to support the case stated in this book. This book is out of the mainstream of economic thought to the extent that it can be such. All the economists I read have contrary views to those espoused in this treatise.This book is a horrible book.,0
"Slapstick Heaven: I peed on myself about 7 times. I love the old slapstick that eludes the majority of films today. There is plenty of room for the mysteries, science fiction, love stories, biographies, horror and action, but this movie just tickles my soul. I watch it over and over and laugh out loud everytime. If you need a good old belly laugh, stick this movie in the DVD or the VHS and wait for someone you know or are related to, to appear.",1
"Little Sister, Jacy: Little SisterBy Kara DalkeyThis was a great book that I could never put down! It was an adventuous tail of young Mitsuko (Little Puddle) trying to save her sister with help of many friends alone the way. Mitsuko's city was attacked and her and her family had to flee to a dirty little cabin alone the way. But before they got there Yugiri, her sister Amaiko's husband was killed by monks. Amaiko won't talk move or do anything that showed she was living, her soul had fled her. Mitsuko went on a series of journeys to find Yugiri's soul to find Amaiko's soul who was looking for Yugiri. Goranu helped and let Mitsuko fly on his back and let her alone the way. With out Goranu the book would have been nothing, he added everything. The book was a very good adventuous, romantic, story.",1

"How much ink is in this?: What's in this, about 1 oz of ink? You go through these like bottled water. I guess its obvious why Epson doesn't have clear ink containers like the knock offs -- you'ld see it was almost empty when you bought it.",0
Never another Seagate: I bought this drive because I needed the disc space for video editing. It worked fine for a couple of months then windows explorer kept locking up my computer while trying to access the drive. Seagate was zero help at all. Their suggestion was to reformat and start over. So I backed all my data and reformatted. 2 months later it is locking my computer up again. I have two WD external drives and they work great. If I unplug the Seagate then I have no problems. I will be buying a large internal to replace it.,0
"Gluten ingredients. Watch out if you're celiac or gluten sensetive.: I personally contacted this company because this product looked great. It got amazing reviews on amazon, the company has a good reputation, etc. So, when I spoke to garden of life, they said that two of there ingredients (oat grass and barley grass, don't know why the heck they added those...), may have actual grain pieces in them, which came through in the processing of them. Now, if you're celiac, that will seriously mess up your gut. I just want to let people know, who are celiac or gluten sensetive, that this product will probably cause you serious problems.",0
"GINGER AND LESBIANS: Body Snatchers from another world invade Earth disguised as ginger root, and the women who have been body snatched become lesbians. A couple of men who apparently come in contact with the dreaded ginger root when their bodies are snatched the lesbians shoot them. Oh and the heroine who really isn't a heroine betrays her BFF. The End.",0
"Not worth it: 1) the drive is bulky-- takes up too much room. 2) Can't stack it, because of its rounded shape. 3) It stands on 4 little legs-- with little foam pads-- which constantly fall off. 4) It doesnt use a standard plug -- 5) Nearly impossible to get ahold of tech support.I went throught 3 different QPS drives untill I switched to a different brand.Dont make the mistake that i did--- go for another brand",0
"Love you Laymon!!!: I started reading Laymon about two years ago and became a huge fan!!!! I have read about 20 of his novels so far and Flesh was one of the first. It gets you going from start to finish with plenty of gore, violence and sex! Laymon is great with detail and captivates you with every page...",1
"A little better than I first thought...: Some of you may recognize my name from a review I did previously about this album stating that it wasn't even close to being as good as 'Frozen in Time.' Well I gave it a second listen & it's not the first time this has happened, but I think the album is a little better than I first thought. I still think 'Xecutioner's Return' isn't as good as 'Frozen in Time' (Obituary's return to the metal game) but it is the usual sound that you would expect from this band.",1
"HW good, software -deal killer: No real issues with the hardware. (where it gets the stars)Software is an unmitigated disaster. Works or not at a whim. Or stops working in the middle of an operation. USB or networked, does not matter. Fails reliably on several models of laptops, then works again. Exasperating. Can't run a business with this thing. Have three of these boat anchors, provides full time employment for tech. About as desirable as bird flu.Was strongly pro HP... but with the LJ3015, LJ3050 bloatware and now this, we're considering a major change.",0
"Very informative: This book is definetly very informative. It gives you a better understanding on how to interepret the programs. Two things that I didn't like are the hand written parts in the book, and some times the author is tends to get a little wordy, and you have to reread parts to get a clear understanding.",1
Turtle is a hit!: I bought this for a 6 year old who can only sleep with the lights on...until now! Now she keeps her turtle on. Only comment - the batteries it came with were dead so have an extra set ready to put in.,1
"Great tent but a little leakage around the door zippers: THe tent was perfect for our family with 2 kids. Easy to set up. It hold steady on a pretty stormy day with lots of rain.The one downside was that after 1/2 an hour of raining, drops of rain started to come in the tent via the door zippers in the lower corners.Besides that a great tent, but a tent should not leak at all in my opinion.",1
"South Africa Road Atlas: I ordered this atlas hoping for an atlas of South Africa of the quality of the Rand MacNally Atlases put out for the US, and was very disappointed in this one. It is barely more than useless, with maps with inadequate detail, and no good map of the whole country for planning purposes. We are currently in South Africa and have had to get other maps. There are better atlases (we had one five years ago, but cannot find it this year on the internet).",0
"Yo! the Iraq War Raps: If this film is any true indication of how the war in Iraq is going, it's not that much different from a downtown street corner, occasional flak aside. ""Gunner's Palace"" is more a playground for aspiring rappers than a look at the battlefield and is dearly in need of a focus and some scissor action in the editing room - CNN coverage is more interesting. In sporadic instances, a soldier divulges something profound, as if it was an accident, like a monkey at a keyboard accidentally pecking out lines from Shakespeare. And if nothing else, this film channels the tedium of war. You're time is better utilized watching ""Control Room"" or ""Osama.""",0
"Good entertainment: Not the best movie I've ever seen some moments seem to drag for me. Movies are to entertain and dispite some of the dull spots I must say I was entertained. movie arrived in a timley manor,my hats off to the shipper...",1
"Mildy interesting, intensely depressing: Life is short, you never know when your time will come, yes we know. Kapesh is an old arrogant academic trying to recapture the sexual passion of youth, clinging to this beautiful young girl. This tale may have been better left as a book, not a movie. It's a trite story, we see so often of the older man falling for the much younger girl. So this time it's she who dies. So sad, too true. Nothing wrong with the acting, just a boring tale of the usual sadnesses of life.",0
"Informative video: Interesting information about ghost towns. However, the video I received seemed to be defective (it was a library discard) and was very hard to watch without getting dizzy. Tracking did not improve matters. Oh well, it only cost a few bucks.",0
"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.: It could just be the cars that I'm using it in, but I've tried it in 3 so far and it only worked decently in one of them. With the volume raised completely on the iPod and the stereo, I could still barely get a decent sound. If that wasn't the problem, the cassette itself would make an unbearable noise. The bass and treble aren't very good either. It's a risk to buy this. It's cheap enough if you want to try it out.",0
NOT true to size: NOT true to size. Measured against another pair of Champion Fleece pants and waist band is the same but the seat is a GOOD 6-8 inches smaller. Quality control messed up on these.,0
"Good elements for understanding theory of state: In spite of certain mistrust in capitalism and an underlining Hegelian aproach, who some modern readers could not like, Theory of State remarks a lot of interesting elements that for sure will help to understand the complicate phenomenon of the State. Also, I saw no problem in the facts that the book was written in Weimar Republic's epoch or that Heller died without completely finish his book. I recommend this reading.",1
"Good for title song only: I'm an old guy, but the very first record I ever got was a Christmas present from my sister called Telstar by the Tornadoes. Still have it and still love it. So, when I saw this CD, I thought, ""Wow! I can listen to it without 40 years of static!"" I'm very disappointed in the pressing, very trebly and sloppily mastered, or maybe that's the way it originally sounded, and I have only a nostagia-attached feeling toward it. Surely, there's a better pressing somewhere. This one stinks.",0
"good support: I got this item at the recommendation of my doctor for a back/hip area that was aggravated and causing discomfort while walking during pregnancy. Four days in this and everything has gone back to its original comfortable position. I haven't had to wear it constantly, but when the hip/back area starts to get aggravated I just put this on for about 4 days and the pain goes away.",1
"Another stinker by Koontz: This is the tenth Koontz book I have read and by far it is the worst of the worst. His other books were inconsistantly fair to bad, but TickTock really stinks. I won't go into any details because other reviewers did it for me.I trashed this book -- literally -- threw it in the trash.",0
"Item not as pictured: Buyer beware! The rug that is pictured is not what will arrive. I received my rug yesterday and the border is not blue as described, it is burnt orange and doesn't really look right next to all the other bedding. I was disapointed with the quality as well. I am returning the whole safari collection and picking a new nursery theme.",0
"Devil Winds Blows You Away: I just got my DVD of Devil Winds and it is awesome. Joe Lando(Dr. Quinn, Higher Ground) is still a hottie. The storyline is very plausible and the CGIs look like a real tornado was happeining. The chemistry between Pete (Joe) and Julia (Nicole Eggert) could have been explored more, but there is alot of action to make up for it. If you like ""disaster"" type movies, I think this one will become a favorite to watch.",1
"Best Mouser EVER!: This thing is GREAT! Put peanut butter in it, and then just put it against the wall and check it every day. The light only blinks 24hrs, so make sure you check it. I tried others, and this one had 2 mice on the first day I had it. (ok I was grossed out by that, but happy at the same time.) well worth the money.",1
"Tears of Sadness and Joy: It took me less than a weekend to read this book...and it was a very busy weekend. Somehow, I couldn't put it down. The story of Jamie Sullivan, the awkward daughter of a widowed Baptist minister in the 1950s, and Landon Carter, the popular son of a US Congressman, is absolutely incredible.They begin as absolute opposites...she's the shy, sweet girl who everyone makes fun of in school. He's the guy everyone wants to be friends with. They end up having the leading parts in the Christmas play, and their friendship begins to evolve. It turns into love, but then a heartbreaking discovery may split them forever.This is a walk everyone should take, but be prepared with plenty of tissues.Nicholas Sparks did an excellent job describing the settings and happenings of the book. I'd never read a book by him before, but now I'm contemplating checking out some of his other books.",1
Not happy: So far at least 3 disks have been defective. I felt the gift I gave was not up to Amazon's reputation. The packaging was OK but some of the disks were not in the album correctly,0
"No building!: This book is not a guide. It simply gives you the source and explains how it works, and not a very good job at that. This was my second FlashMX book, and I wasn't please with either. Learn FlashMX in 24 Hours was better but neither were sound teaching guides. I'm still looking for one that will teach me to build a decent Flash site.",0
"One of the best cd's you'll find at Amazon.com: I've waited since the invention of cd's for Godley&Creme's ""L"" album to appear on cd. If you like your music melodic, rhythmically interesting - if you like singers that can sing, and players that can play - and can play with inventiveness and brilliance - if you like lyrics intelligent, artistic and witty, you'll love this. ""L"" is a masterpiece, and the other album is 99% as good. These people have nothing to declare but their combined genius.",1
"Oops: After Cara's first two excellent albums that retained a real traditional feel within a modern setting, this came as a huge disappointment. The voice is just as lovely, but the music has veered right away from the traditional and into bland commercial-style music. Right in the footsteps of Mary Black. A pity.",0
"HARD HITTING DETECTIVE SERIES: BRENNER is one of the grittiest, hard-hitting detective shows I've ever watched. It has a film noir atmosphere, and does not shy away from taking provocative stands on a myriad of issues. For example, one episode explores the right of the individual to say ""no"" to the peer group pressure of a newly-formed vigilante group, a concept that strikes at the heart of functioning democratic societies. The only complaint of I have with this boxset is that BRENNER did not have more episodes to include. Nevertheless, anyone who loves those shows from THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION which specialize in provoking reflection/discussion on germaine issues confronting society will not be disappointed with this truly excellent series.",1
"Outdoorsman: I paid too much for this product. I wanted a Camera that was lightweight with good zoom that I could pack hunting to take pictures of wildlife. It's a little heavier than I wanted, and the zoom is difficult. The LED does not work very well in any kind of light and it really needs a view port. I'm also unhappy with the delay between actually taking the picture and the picture frame. My wife doesn't even want it!",0

"Sacred in Spirit: This is one CD where every song will reach out and guide your inner feelings; the rhythm works well whether driving, hiking, relaxing or working out! After listening to over 25 Native American CD's (or referenced as such) this Sacred Spirit is the best. If the price is too high for a first attempt at Sacred Spirit, purchase the Sacred Spirit CD entitled ""Yeha-Noha"", you won't be disappointed. You can sample the tracks on Amazon.",1
"If you have a little vouyer [sic] in you...: ...or can navigate a stream of consciousness, give this book a peek (if you can find it). Came looking for this book as a gift for a friend only to find that it's out of print (rats). I thought this was quite a remarkable read (never saw a story done in handwriting-like font). And as naked as he is on the cover, Sean gives us a raw look into his life. Definitely not organized or logical (who's life is?) but often entertaining, sometimes insighful, and a difficult though revealing look into one guy's life. Recommended if you're looking for something different...",1
"Readers Beware: This book wasted 3 hours of my life which I will never get back. I like the fact that Cornwell has decided to take a different path and expand her writing but Isle of Dogs is a jumble of boring and incoherrent passages loosely put together. It seems Cornwell must be trying to fulfill some contract with her publisher and that is why she released this book of nonsense. It is meant to have a comedic theme, well it doesn't! The characters and plot are so unbeleiveable and moronic I would suggest that anyone who enjoys this book should seek serious professional help!",0
"One of the better psych books in a long time: I found this book to be extremely insightful, and it has really informed my decisions a great deal moving forward. After reading this I sent myself an ""email from the past"" to test if the things that I think will make me happy actually come to pass five years from now.",1
"All this with Jay and Silent Bob, too.: What if two fallen angels found a loophole that could get them back into heaven? Now what if that same loophole might just cause the destruction of the entire universe?That's the premise of this wonderful movie. (And don't believe the rumors you've heard about blasphemy and damnation for all that see it!)With plenty of theological ""inside jokes"" to keep any Catholic school graduate enthralled, the plot, action and dialog all make this a very enjoyable and compelling film. Truly comical. Truly intellectual (Hey! don't let that put you off!). But mostly, truly enjoyable.If you liked Jay and Silent Bob from Mall Rats, you'll love this film!",1
"This is a terrific book: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, which provided very clear definitions of learning challenges for children, and more importantly how you can help your child cope with these challenges. Most of all I found the practical advice provided in the book boosted my confidence as a parent to deal with my child's learning challenges.Well done!",1

"Here's the REAL jist of the DVD....: Good: Fact that it is the foo fighters, selection of songs (except they don't have much from their self titled debut), the toronto concert, the acoustic pieces in Washington DC Concert, the price, the DVD-ROM exclusive content (a lot better than the content made available on their ""One by One - ENHANCED features"" CD).Bad: At times the echo at the stadium is disguised by ""shifting"" in the frames; meaning that the sound quality is not as good as it could have been, the mikes for the crowd at toronto weren't set at a high enough volume (during Breakout, Grohl asked the crowd to sing the chorus: you can hardly hear them), expected some music videos but none were included.My Judgement: This DVD is damn good, provided you're willing to suffer a little bit from the sound quality at times. The lack of music videos is a bit of a sore point with this DVD, but it is still worth buying.",1
"Disappointing: I've really tried to enjoy this author, and this was my third try. Somehow, nothing he writes engages me on any level - the characters are cliches, the ""fantasy"" is cartoonish (balloon men? walking boogers? hello?), the stories are poorly structured and lack satisfying resolution, and the foreshadowing is as subtle as a kick in the head. I bought this one because the blurb on my edition compared it to Helprin's ""Winter's Tale"" and Crowley's ""Little, Big"". It has as much in common with those great works as a raisin has with a glass of wine. It contains words and is marketed as fantasy - that's where the comparison ends. I could not bring myself to finish the book, a rarity for me. Buyer beware.",0
"Not impressed, quite upset: I bought this product to be able to power a small fan during outdoor events. The first one arrived and I charged as instructed. Tested the inflator, worked fine although it draind the battery dead after inflating 1 tire that was low. Recahrged again and plugged in small house fan, but nothing happened. Called Black and Decker, could ship to them and wait 6 weeks for a new one. Called Amazon, they were great and replaced the product. Got the replacement faster than I did the original. Charged as indicated, plugged a fan in, nothing again! Called amazon for refund and there were no problems with amazon. Very disappointed that both products didn't work for the 1 thing I intended to use it for.",0

"No new information: For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men by Shaunti Feldhahn: This book gives many honest answers from different men in various surveys asking about respect, romance, sex, career and many other various topics. Although the author includes many surveys that show what men want, it doesn't go in detail on the age group, cultural backgrounds or religious backgrounds of these men. To say that most men think a certain way based on a general survey was not very persuasive to me. Even though the topics of the books were very interesting, each chapter was very short and the author failed to go deeper in depth into things that I wanted to learn more. Overall, I didn't find this book enjoyable. I didn't learn anything new about men that I don't already know. However, it served as a reminder of things that I should be aware more on a daily basis.",0

"The First Reviewer Needs to Understand...: The amount of video footage available of Gene Krupa is very sparse. Aside from his motion picture appearances, most video of Gene was not archived for posterity and had to be saved from being lost forever.

For 99.9% of viewers, they would rather have this invaluable video available than not have it available at all.",1

Sometimes I wonder if he's the second coming of Jesus.

"Auto up-down did not work: This sounded like a great product; however, it did not live up to expectations. Upon using this product for the first time, the auto up-down button did not function. When attempting to open the umbrella, it only opened about half way up, forcing me to have to push it up the rest of the way. While it was open, it did seem extremely sturdy. When attempting to close the umbrella via the button, it did not even partially close, again forcing me to have to do it manually. I have received a return authorization from Amazon for this item.",0

I Wanted To Have Two Of Each Size Clamp, So We Ordered A Second Set. We Don't Use These Everyday But They Are Nice To Have When Needed. We Had a Job That Required The Use Of The Small Ones. I Went To The Tool Box, Grabbed them & Proceeded To Affix It To The Line In Which After I Squeezed It The Jaw Broke Off Cleanly. The Break Appeared To Be From A Casting Defect. I Would Not Buy Anymore & Look For A Different Brand To Buy In The Future",0

"TIMELESS CLASSIC: This is a perfect novel written in a unique way to appeal to youngsters and adults alike. I recall reading it many many years ago as a young teenager and being totally enthralled with the plot and the action. Re-read again as a young adult and recall being struck by the outmoded science, but very appreciative of the characters and humorous aspects. Now, having read this a third time, I can realize that its a great blend of plot, action, humor, with a satisfying ending. I will get my young son, a teenager, to try it and hope to take great satisfaction if he enjoys it as much as me...",1

"terrible battery life compared to the 650: The good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the Treo 650's interface that were clunky, and it seems to crash less, but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience -- so much so, that I wish I had never ""upgraded"" to the 680.",0
"Distorted view of the greatest country singer of all time.: I have read this book and was shocked at not only what was in the book, but what was left out of it. The author seems to have been more interested in Eddy Arnold then in Jim Reeves. This book does not by any means tell the full story. Jim deserves credit for what he did for country music and this book doesn't cut it.",0
"Unimpressive: I decided to read this book for the sake of comparison. My normal flow of reading revolves around SF novels of the intelligent, thoughtful, mind-bending type, so I was fairly disappointed in this book for that reason.There was a tremendous amount of action, but it offered little to people looking for drama or subtlety.I understand how people can enjoy this book, but it just isn't my personal cup of tea.",0
"Caution Beware: At first I thought the grill was great until I paid close attention and noticed one thing. The grill top does not even fit over the whole grill!!!! So when I leave my fire shoots up and gets too hot. Also the handle on the top can get extremely hot and make you drop it and burn yourself which has also happened to me. maybe I am the only one, but this grill has been nothing but trouble for me. Never again.",0
"The Sixth Fleet: A disappointing book, written in episodic format, with an unsatisfying ending. The story line is potentially a good one and the writter clearly knows his subject. Unfortunately, the book is burdened with too many, poorly developed characters. Who is the hero? None of the characters are drawn completely enough to make that determination. Once we get interested in a character, he dissapears or is religated to a minor background role. The book does not stand on its own and is obviously intended to be part of a series. The non-ending just appears and the reader must buy the next installment to see what happens. I for one am not biting.",0

"MORE FICTION THAN FACT: I am an expert on cults and was hired by the FBI to perform an in depth study on the Heaven's Gate group. I watched ""Heaven's Gate The Untold Story"" and I was horrified that the producer could try to pass this off as a documentary. I have never seen so much editorializing in a so-called documentary. It was poorly produced, biased and unbalanced, and not worth the hour of my time it took to watch it. Other elements, such as the music, were out of place and just plain weird.I personally would not purchase this video, especially if you are looking for the real story of what happened.",0
"Dangerous...: My German Shepherd dog (who DOESN'T wolf treats) ended up choking on a busy bone and lacerating her throat with a subsequent infection. A vet bill of over $400 dollars for a fun healthy dog treat. NOT WORTH IT. I contacted Purina to make sure no other dogs have to go through what we did, and I'm still waiting for the ""sample collection package"" to arrive for the other bone that was in the bag which I've saved along with the packaging. Don't buy it. I've also read of several cases of bloat caused by this dangerous treat.",0
"Hulked Up!: I just bought the Hulk score, and it's your typically awesome Danny Elfman style with some majorly green muscle behind it. The score is breathtaking and captures the savage beast, mixed with a touch of human essence, only to break through with some smashing beats when you think it's safe to stop for air.A must for any movie score collector, or Hulk fan!!!",1
"Genereic RTS: Skipping the horrible DRM issues (which are enough to warrant the game a score of zero) what we have here is a generic RTS game.Forget any ideas of evolution or discovery. Nothing you do in the cell and amazingly dull creature stages as ANY effect on the game, since you can totally redesign your creature at any point during these stages, and right before the Tribal stage.As soon as you get to the tribal stage, the first thing you are told is to drag the mouse to select multiple units, click on resources to star gathering them, then click on your town hall to start building things.... ah, so original... all hype, no substance.I was amazed seeing the review here on Amazon, I don't think any product has ever earned such a massively negative backlash. It is well deserved, on so many levels.",0
"Obsolete: Years ago I depended heavily on Maclink Plus. Time passed and I found some of my documents were no longer accessible.

Simply put, in my view a formerly great product is now just mediocre and of little use to me.",0

"This movie wasn't too good.: Dr. Doolittle wasn't too good of a movie. It claims to be very funny but only some parts were actually funny. Most of the movie, Eddie Murphy tries to figure out what is wrong with him and finally at the end he figures out that he wants to able to talk to animals. I give this movie 2 stars.",0

Phone features worked as advertised. but the Voice Enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse.3. It was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset.I returned it mainly because of the buzzing.",0
"Predictable and Putrid: Watch the first 10 minutes and you know the rest. It's utterly canned, copied, shallow, and formulaic: a brutal, insulting, jingoistic hero-beats-villain-and-gets-girl gorefest with indecipherable dialogue, improbable fight scenes, gaping plot gaps, and lousy lighting (worse than Meek's Cutoff, and that's saying something) that makes numerous scenes unwatchable. Even the casting is distractingly bad. Even the love scene is botched. This one is a true rotter. However, the DVD is quite smooth and round and might be useful for skipping on water.",0
"Good starter set: This is a great starter kit. However, not suitable for younger children since the tracks are very delicate and sensitive.",1
"aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh no more dog hairs!!!!: ok i know $400 is a lot for a vacuum but we had gone through 2 other machines in less than a year so it was time to take the plunge ,and it is worth it from the first time we used it you could feel and see the differance ,its great for getting under beds and for pet hairs . The hose worked great on the stairs even though its a bit of a workout and might not be good for less able bodied people.All in all 4 OUT OF 5 great machine very strong and lots of funtip... wait untill bed bath and beyond have one of those 20% off coupons thingys save yourself a few bucks",1
"Where's the Quick Release?: I have a smaller Gorillapod that I love---but for some reason, they cut corners and didn't put a quick release mount on this one.

"Love & hate relationship...: I love the clipboard keys (cut, copy,& paste keys.) Use them all the time. My problem is that the right side shift key started to ""stick"" about a year after I bought it. Anyone else out there had the same problem?Unusual positioning of home, delete, end, page up, & page down keys, but you will get used to them as long as you don't use another keyboards elsewhere. The placement of ""insert"" key is interesting. (It is above your number keys.) Keyboard is large. So check your space before you buy it.",1
"Cool Erasing Shield!: I am taking a charcoal drawing class and a guy in the class, who was also a drafter, had one of these. He let me try it for charcoal and it worked really well. Amazon had such a good deal on them that I bought some for my friends in the class, too.",1
Bad when used as a microphone for a computer: I bought this to use as a computer microphone for Skype and to have a mute switch in case I have to sneeze.The biggest downside to this thing is it doesn't pick up sound very well. I have to hold it up to my mouth to be sure people can hear me. I've had better $10 microphones from radio shack that picked up light background sounds coming from my TV.A much lesser secondary problem is it requires an AA battery.,0
"Horrible: After their first CD came out, i figurd Limp Bizkit would be a force to reckon with in years to come. Their second CD wasn't bad either but i figured they would come back harder than ever. Wow, was I wrong. This is quite possibly one of the worst CD's i've ever considered buying. Theyve almost totally abandoned their rock roots and gone completely rap. It's not even as if they are good at rapping. Rollin' is basically the hokey-pokey in a rap version and my generation is an excuse to say the word F*** as many times as possible. Terrible lyrics, bad music, and the loss of what got them here in the first place make this album one of the worst post-debut album I've ever heard.",0
"Film 3 stars - 3D effects 5 stars: If you're looking for a good action flick with great 3D effects then you'll likely enjoy this title. If, however you're looking for any cerebral plot or story line look elsewhere. This is a movie to watch when you're simply looking for action and want to take your 3D TV and DVD player for a run of fun. If this were not available in 3D, I wouldn't bother with it as there are too many other action/special effect flicks that I'd personally prefer. For fans of 3D though this is a fun ride.",1
"THIS STORY HAS EDGE: My third Tess Gerritson novel - my favorite thus far of the three I have read, although I liked them all. I was swept up by the opening and stayed up nearly all night trying to finish the book. Totally exciting and scary. I liked the introduction, which was very unusual. I'm sure that this story is probably being enacted right now in the U.S. Totally possible, in my opinion.",1

"Not Just for Physics Teachers: This is a great book with a somewhat misleading title. While it is, indeed, the companion book for the ""Physics Suite"" it is really far more than that. If you are interested in a concise review of educational research in the learning and teaching of technical subjects, this book is outstanding. It is written by an experienced teacher, for teachers, and includes not only the relevant research but many suggestions and examples for implementing the results of the educational and cognitive research.I am a long-time college teacher of engineering technology and now researching in engineering education. I was ""turned-on"" to this book by a doctoral student in physics education and am very, very grateful to him for that. It might have been a long time (if ever) before I stumbled onto this treasure myself. My suggestion to the author would be to also publish this material (minus the Physics Suite specifics) as a book on reseach-based teaching of technical subjects.",1
"Are we supposed to be happy for her?: I'm glad she finally found some degree of self-fulfillment, but there are better ways to learn to like yourself than losing 150 pounds. My concern is that this book perpetuates the myth that thin=happiness and fat people are emotionally disturbed in some way. Definitely there are a lot of people who have emotional issues that affect their eating habits, but often the cure is to work on the emotional issues instead of another diet. If your happiness is contingent on your weight, it's likely that you'll never really be satisfied. If this book does anything good, it is in showing that that losing weight will not make your problems go away.",0
"Atkins Dieter's Beware: I was disappointed with this book and I don't use it. Recipes list carb counts but do not list fiber content. This leaves you unable to know the net carb count of these recipes. Try ""500 Low Carb Recipes"" by Dana Carpenter it's excellent.",0
"Wonderful Watch: This watch was bought for my 13 year old daughter and it is everything described to be. It keeps accurate time by synchronizing to the WWV signal from Fort Collins, CO at NIST, and never needing a battery as it charges through the dial by solar power. It is attractive and accurate. The only flaw is that the white color tends to get the band dirty quickly. You can also wear it while swimming in a pool!",1
"Hope this was the last one: I have appreciate the first one, it was in a way very original.The second chapter has succeed in creating a surprise, but the last chapter is the weakest of the three. I just hope that this one the last one, don't make a serie like Friday the 13th....please !",0

"Incredibly deep...again!: I went to Best Buy to purchase the Step Up to the Microphone project by Newsboys, but ran across If I left the Zoo by JOC. I don't regret the choice, just the fact that I didn't have more than $15. This CD is another stellar effort by JOC. I really need to listen to it on a deeper lyrical level to understand everything that is being said. Musically, this CD is genius. These guys have proven that they can move from one musical style to another and execute them brilliantly. The only reason this CD didn't get 4 stars resides in the lyrical content. I have no doubt that they are trying to tell a great message in their songs, and I believe I will understand it by and by, but I'm concerned about the highly esoteric, poetic flavor of IF I left the Zoo. The Ist CD had such an unabashed, this-is-how-it-is feel that seems to have ""degraded"" since Much Afraid. That's all I have to say. As I stated before, I need to listen to this CD to get the full message behind these riddles.",1
"Wrong temp: I have it hanging outside and it mostly says it is 60, but sometimes it moves to 40. Of course, that is when it's 20 or 30 degrees hotter or colder. Very disappointed. The theremometer is beautiful, but just doesn't work.",0

"Boring: I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels, and have loved all of them . . . until this one. Where all of Clancy's previous novels have been full of intertwining plot threads which weave and wind until they all come together and culminate in an explosive, breathtaking climax, this book just plods along and leaves the reader waiting for something interesting to happen, which unfortunately never develops. The usual complexity of his plot twists just aren't there, and what looked to be a promising and interesting story never really goes anywhere.If you're a casual Tom Clancy reader, or are new to Clancy's works, stay away from this dud because it's really not typical of his usual high-quality of writing and suspense.",0
Helps protect the firepit: The firepit cover was as described. Some rain gets throught the sewn seams but it is still better than having the firepit totally exposed to the weather.,1

"A punchy and hot pick-up: I've had an SSL-4 in the bridge position of my Strat for more than a quarter-century. This old model is a little noisy compared to better-shielded contemporary single-coil pick-ups, but you can't beat 27 years of aging that mellows the Alnico V magnets, so the tone on this is mellow and rich, yet with punchy responsiveness and very hot output. When tapped, it gets the glassy traditional Strat sound. I've really loved having one, but I'm actually going to swap mine out for something less noisy but equally hot 'n' nasty, like a new SHR-1.",1
"Compass doesn't function under water: Nice watch but totally useless if you want to use the compass under water. You have to keep pushing one of the buttons continually or else the compass will blank out to save battery life. Nowhere in the advertising does it say ""don't push the buttons underwater"". Once you get it the manual says ""don't push the buttons underwater."" Why in the world would Timex boast that the watch is water resistant to 100 meters if you can't access all the functions? You can't even set it to compass mode and have it stay there for any length of time. Typical sleazy advertising on Timex's part in my opinion. I'm taking the watch diving next week and I will push buttons underwater. If the watch fails, it goes into the trash. This is the absolute last Timex product I will ever buy.",0
"THE FOURFEATHERS--VERY DISAPPOINTED: This version is the weakest of the threeI have seen. I own the 1939 and 1978 versions. The acting is good, but the screenplay is a bust--too superficial in dealing with the basic theme of cowardice and redemption. Also,having HeathLedger walk among the rebel Sudanese poorly disguised detracts from his effectiveness.The best of the three versions is still the 1939(a great year for great movies!). The plot/screenplay are more true to the arrogant/colonial mood of the day and the acting by Sir Ralph Richardson, John Clements, and C. Aubrey Smith are as yet unmatched. Clements' disguise is more credible, and the battle scenes more realistic. The 1939 version has it hands down, and the directing/screenwriting of the 2002 version are misguided. This could have been a great remake, but is tepid, shallow and falls far short of the mark.",0
"replacement: Overall I'm happy with the mount, this was a replacement for the original that came with my Garmin after the pin kept falling out. This one seems to be much better built. I travel a lot and wouldn't be caught dead without my GPS and this mount.",1
"Not for the veteran hunter: Reviews looked great, unfortunately i think they where written by newbies to archery hunting. For the price you can't beat it for a starter release. Do not care for the smoothness of the release nor the nylon whimpy strap that connects the release to your wrist. The scenario ""You get what you pay for "" holds true for this item.",0
"Poor Sound Quality: Excellent songs - bad sound. Some songs are very soft and some are just soft. When listening, I have to contantly turn the volume up and down. I would not recommend this.",0
"Growing Pain: A learning experience the reader or read to person looking in. The story of the older brother learning some valuable experience from his younger sister, and other girls.",1
"Will Penny: Wish I COULD have viewed this video! It had a ""region error"", wouldn't play. Amazon refunded price of DVD, but I had to pay to send it back. No longer order DVD's from Amazon. I do love this old movie. Haven't seen it in years. Do recommend the movie, but don't know where you can buy a working copy.",0
Works well: Needed help for the girl bikes on our Thule bike rack. The Allen Tension Bar works well. Easy to use.,1
"A splendid combination of Reggae and Grateful dead magic: Truly some of the best Grateful Dead inspired music recorded. Brings a fresh breath of life into some of the best songs of all time, not to be missed.",1
"Slow and pretty limited: Installation was uneventful. I selected the first DVD in the ""Area 88"" set: three half-hour animes. You have the option of selecting languages and titles, and Crunch keeps the orginal Dolby soundtrack. But first: it cached all three selections, an agonizingly slow process. Then, when I selected ""Itunes"" as the target destination, it didn't default to the ""Library - Movies"" section. Why not? In fact, Crunch didn't even SEE that destination. Now for the converstion. Whaaaaaat?? It hung at ""0% complete"" for at least 30 seconds, then sloooooooowly started. At the rate it was working, it would have taken hours to convert the material. DVD Fab does the same job in probably half the time. And guess what? It will only convert unencrypted DVDs, so don't count on this as your tool for loading your video Ipod.There are free products out there that do the job, and do it faster, than Crunch.",0
"Fabulous photos, and excellent information.: I wish I found this book when I first arrived in New Delhi two years ago. It is an excellent resource for tourists, providing good, specific information on dining, shopping, and sights. I would also recommend it highly for diplomats or businessmen coming to live in Delhi for a time. It gives an outstanding overview of the city, and all that it offers.The photography is excellent. I found this guide one month before I was due to depart Delhi, and I bought it anyway, for the photographs of the many places in Delhi I had visited while living there.",1
"Worth the price of admission for any adventure gamer: While this game is not truly perfect, it is atop its field. The graphics are as good as you will find in adventure gaming and actually look as good as most action titles. The problem this game faces is that by using a keyboard interface and streamlining the game, they limit the player to one inventory item at a time. This means that in many locations, you will do a lot of running around collecting items that could have been saved with even the most basic inventory system present in action titles.Still the voice acting is decent and the soundtrack is the best on the market. Best yet the story will keep you engaged, though you may find there are some difficult moments in interpreting the story if you are not familiar with the Wagnerian Opera the title is based on.",1
"This book is so stupid, don't waste your money on it!: If you wanna read about Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, not about his ex-wife then do not buy this book! This book is so stupid it's not really even about Steven and Aerosmith.",0
"Keeps you reading...: I have always been an avid reader of true crime. I found this book to fall along the same lines of the Homoka/Bernardo case here in Canada to the point of being scarey. I have to sit here and wonder after reading this book how two individuals can become so sick and demented to kill/decapitate and burn another human being. Both Will & Stephanie can blame no others then themselves, and to try to blame the other is totally crazy in itself. This tells me that they are in denial of their actions which is not good. Until they can admit to their part fully and take ownership they will never heal.Just a Canadian viewer",1
"I refuse to believe that this is even Cristian singing!: It doesn't sound anything like him. The vocals are awful, and do not sound anything like Cristian's voice which is fantastic on his CD's Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor and Lo Mejor De Mi. So I don't know what the deal is here. I think they had another singer actually do the tracks on this CD, and then put Cristian's face on the cover of the CD, unless Cristian got some SERIOUS singing lessons in the span of one year (this CD was in 1997 and Lo Mejor De Mi was in 1998 and is EXQUISITE). This is bad bad bad.",0
"The Most Amazing Soundtrack on the Planet Earth: Hey, If you have seen the movie, you know what I am talking about! This Cd Has some of the best feel-good songs on it! I bought it for myself, and my friends and we all love it, It's a great Cd for the car, work or at home! If you haven't seen the movie I reccomend that you do, I think that it is out on Video now, and If you want to know the name of the song that Julia Stiles sings, its.. Al Green (Let's Stay Together) I have been trying to figure that out for along time! Well Hope this was helpful, but i gotta go listen to some more great songs of this awesome CD!",1
"Celtic Tiger: Very enjoyable. Additional features take you through setting up of the show, rehersals & getting to meet some of the dancers. Several different types of dancing.Had to change format to be able to watch it in the UK on pal.",1
"Not photo paper.: I should have believed the plethora of reviews stating that this is cardstock, not photo paper. I thought ""Canon can't be deceiving loyal customers who just spent hundreds of dollars on a new printer."" I was wrong.",0
horrible!...: This is the worst book I have read on Princess Diana. The bookmade me cringe. It was so unbeleviably stupid that I could noteven bring myself to finish it. Don't waste your money on thispiece of [not good material]. The only reason I give it 1 star is because [website] does not allow for any thing less!,0
"Not even worthy of one star !!!: Quotes from TV, Hollywood, Popular music and such...What [garbage]!! Shameful self promotion on the introductory page..how a seminary president was Sooo impressed with his illustrations...that these illustration would PREACH..ha! Not at all in line any form of biblical preaching.Just horrible!! I may have used one of his illustrations but the rest of the pages would best be used for a bird cage.",0
"Let Down: Having only heard One Simple Word, and being quite happy with what I heard,I was looking forward to this album being the breakthrough.Let down is all I can say that i felt.Overall the album was boring.It seems like TVT hyped this release as that Big album that we all knew the world was waiting for.And I bought it because I know the connells stand apart from most of the backwash we are forced to deal with on the corporate airwaves.I believe there is Still Life now I just need to get it.Looking forward to genuine guitar pop.",0
"Breakfast on the go: I love this thing! Every other week, I take my 18-month old daughter to an early morning ""mommy and baby"" social at church. Because we're always in a hurry those mornings, I cook her pancakes or other finger food breakfast the night before and heat it up the next morning. Instead of waiting for her to finish breakfast, she eats on the drive to church. I love that the tray has a lip all around and keeps her dish from sliding off the tray. That's about the only time I use it.We will likely be using it to keep her entertained during the long road trips this holiday season. It holds her books and sturdy enough to also hold her favorite bulky pop-up toy.",1
Too fragile to use: I immediately returned these as they seemed ready to break the first time I put them on. The strap is super thin and brittle.,0
"Not as good as others: I am an avid Amazon shopper, and I was disappointed with this book. It's just pages of a bunch of lists of names. A lot of names are repeated in different categories. I would recommend the book, Baby Name Wizard.",0
"too dark, bad music, cute elves: I'm only giving it 2 stars because I like the retro animation. Most of this movie is dark and depressing - starts out with kids bullying a girl with a cane, spends way too much time in an awful orphanage, eventually moves to the underground place where the bad guy lives. No catchy music. Didn't like it!",0
One good song...: I ordered this CD based on one song I had heard. It turns out that is the ONLY good song on it. The rest of the CD isn't anything I want to listen to. What else can I say? Steer clear...,0
"Doesn't Last Long: I am on my second Viking card. My first lasted about a year and died, slowly losing a few pictures here and there and then an entire Christmas full of pictures before I had a change to upload them on my computer. Viking replaced the first card no problem, but I'm still out the pictures and now the new card doesn't work after about eight months of use. I don't know if this is normal for all cards, but at the price I originally paid (about $45), it really stinks.UPDATE: My second card started dying after about 6 months of use.",0
"Not Good: I liked how this movie started out. Then it turned into an overly sentimental, horribly acted piece of trash. I don't understand how anyone could give this movie 4 stars or better and have even a decent taste in films.",0
"Great Game! Spyro!: Finally Spyro is released! After having it for PS1 I couldn't wait for a follow-up. And I am not disappointed. Our dragon comes with new shooting capabilities, he can shoot ice, lightning and bubbles. A variety of new vehicals, like a UFO. How crazy is that. 30 or so levels to explore and collect those dragonflies. Just good times stuffed into a video game. I love that game ans so will you, go grab your copy today! And thanks for reading my review.",1
"A great follow-up: David Gray has put out a great CD to follow his first hit record 'White Ladder.' The sound is familiar yet, different. The lyrics are again well thought out, clever, and insightful. You will not be disappointed with 'A New Day at Midnight' if you enjoyed his first album.",1
"Total cheese hell...: I really can't believe why so many people actually gave this piece of cheesy (stuff) 5 stars! It looks like most people can't tell good music from a hole in the ground. Compared to their earlier release ""Homework"" (and most other electronic dance albums) this album just plain (stinks). All the songs are badly written and covered with tons of sticky, slimy, gooey cheese. Don't bother buying this.",0
"Ice to Fire - in short: Ice to Fire is a great read.., timely and interesting when one considers the importance of this area to the world in terms of natural resources, as well as the historical significance of the physical location and the everyday challenges that the native people faced. The characters are very realistic and the story hangs together well. I'm sure a sequel is in order!Elle Jay",1
"Morons irritate me: I just finished watching this movie, and I will admit that I don't fully understand it. BUT...I'm not going to be a moron and say I hate it. If you don't understand it, watch it again! The more critical (and in my opinion smart) human mind is going to want to learn something instead of lazily criticizing it. Spark your imagination and truly try to understand this movie. Give your brain a little exercise. I'm only 15, and I have every intention of watching this movie until I understand it all, and I don't know about you, but that sounds a bit more mature than the ""adults"" here that won't give this movie credit for its clear ability to provoke thought. I fully recommend this movie.",1
"too much boy bands nowadays: When I first heard ""Summer Girls"" I hated it. But then, since it got so much airplay on the radio the song gradually grew on me. Unfortunately for the rest of the cd, I have to say that LFO is just another one-hit wonder. I don't think they could compete with NSYNC,98*, or BSB. There can only be sooo many boybands in the world.. it's overwhelming! The guys are goodlooking but that's about it. Sorry.",0
Love Comes Softly: This is a wonderful adaption of the fictional book about real and lasting love. I useually read the book first and end up prefering the book over the movie. I felt torn between the two. It would have been nice to have more of the characters included in the movie and more of the thoughts of the main character. The actors in the movie gave the story more depth into the characters emotions. I hope to see more movies like this one. If only Hollywood would wake up and smell the roses instead of trying to feed us garbage like they have been doing for the past 10 years.,1
"great speakers: I love this speaker set. I've been using them for 6 years now, as both my pc and tv speakers, and they have always worked great. They even work with the new Dolby Digital (DD) 5.1 tracks on some Blu-ray discs that seem to be a slightly higher bit-rate than the DVD DD 5.1 tracks (note: I'm not talking about about DD-TrueHD, just standard DD 5.1 that is transported through SPDIF). (I mention this because I've run into several older Sony receivers that actually don't support the slightly higher bit-rate DD on some Blu-rays.) They also sound great, at least to me, and the sub puts out a lot of ""oomph"" for being such a small one. All-in-all, this set was definitely worth the money.",1
"It all depends on what you want.: Maybe the yellow/orange LED display is a little harsh. But you have to concede that this is a stylish little piece of electronics. We bought this as a gift for a teenager, and she's been delighted with it's abilities ranging from radio to CD player to nightlight to lullaby machine. It's a good value for the money. If you want better sound or more options, look for something more expensive.",1
Fun Read- Excellent Historical Fiction: An entertaining historical novel and a good review of the progression of jet aircraft design and development from the prior-to WWII period to the mid-50s. There are a lot of familiar names in here and the story is plausible. Great fun and a quick read and a good way to pass the time on an airliner.,1
"Please, for the love of anything, learn to write, Charlaine.: This book went directly to Half Price Books after I managed to choke myself through it. A talented writer Charlaine Harris is not. Her style is boring, bland, and repetitious. And her ""heroine,"" Sookie, is laughably trite, even for a telepath. Is there even a reason she has these powers? Do I care? Why does anyone, when the plot moves at a dirigible's pace? Just, no. Save yourself a few bucks and pick up a Kim Harrison novel or an older Laurell K. Hamilton. Even Karen Chance. But don't waste your money on a book that should have been given an ""F"" in Creative Writing class.",0
"Died after 6 weeks: The brush died after 6 weeks of light use, alternating with a manual brush. In the meantime, the metal melted and caused noticeable taste and probably can be attributed for some metal accumulation on a tooth. This is not worth it even at this price.",0
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS.: This has got to be the worst zombie movie in all of movie history.The concept was very promising but the movie fell flat on its face.The acting was horrible and there are many things in the movie which dont add up.The video game clips all throughout the movie are very annoying and the matrix effects are a blatant ripp off.Please dont buy this movie because it is a poor excuse for a horror movie.,0
"Shoddy construction, Don't be lured by chepaer price!!: The idea and concept of this litter box is great, however the execution is terrible. Feces and clumps get stuck at the bottom of the ramp and under the sifter. I used the vegetable spray trick to avoid sticking to the base... to no avail! Pieces unless pretty sizable, do not make it the entire way up the ramp, and circle in the box for eternity. I use fresh step litter, and have not found any difference in the box's effectiveness based on the litter brand. I end up cleaning the unit almost as much as a plain old litter box. The side walls are very low and if your cat digs with any effort at all, feces and litter will be mounded outside the box daily. I need to keep a shop vac next to the box at all times. The plastic is flimsy and the lid warps after several months. Clumps will lift the lid off the base and stop operation. Buyer beware!",0
"How fun to read!: What a lovely book! Both my children have adored this book and grew to understand the message of tolerance, creativity and fun. Critical to the success of childrens' books is the meld between the illustrations (which are wonderful) and the words which are fun to read out loud and fun to read on your own. Funny there should be a negative review posted here (which prompted me to write this one). While there are social implications in this book, I think there is no political agenda at play. But then, many things we are taught as kids are sadly lost as we grow older.",1
"Poor sound quality: I took this headset in to replace an old, falling-apart set of headphones from KOSS, that costed me under $20. Sound quality is substantially worse than my old analog KOSS set. Enough said.I have no idea what those people, that post ""excellent"" reviews, were comparing it to. I do not recall hearing sound this bad as in those headphones.",0
Patti's cookbook: I have tried several of the recipes and they were not difficult. The dishes were enjoyable and healthy. Most ingredients were easy to obtain (except for the substitute for oil in baking). We are moving toward healthy eating and the dishes helped to change our way of thinking. I enjoyed the little stories and the pictures.,1
"start the commotion rocks: I bought this CD for ""start the commotion"" and it rocks but the other 14 tracks were a disappointment. Start the commotion seems out of place with the rest, hip hop or whatever that is called. I say trash but you decide. Please listen before you buy. I did buy this for the one tune mentioned, so I do not feel that I got gypted. Start the commotion delivers 5 full minutes of driving/listening pleasure.",0
"Very funny and wise, and so graceful.: It is upsetting to see how harsh someone else has been about this wise helpful book, which is also very funny and full of remarkable truth about the people all across the english-speaking world who have cherished warm spots for Samuel Johnson. This is a clever book and a great tribute to what that grand man did, and how impossible he was, and yet so needed. And his cat also.",1
"An external journey of your inner self...: This tale of a soldier of fortune is a roller coaster ride between heaven and hell, good and evil, and what is right and wrong. Mr. Clarke painstakingly paints each scene with words that allows you to taste, feel, smell and touch the soul of the main character and those around him. Your emotions will swing as you cheer and denounce his actions all on the same page. A great, can't put it down read, that will challenge your own values and morality. An incredible discovery of your own and society's ethics and inner self. Be prepared to wish it had no final page!",1
"Closer than most, but still with errors: This is one of the better Bible movies I have seen (not a big compliment). However, it is filled with errors. The one glaring error that stays with me is when Jesus heals the Centurion's servant (Matthew 8). In this movie, Jesus acts like he despises the Centurion and is going out of his way to do it, when in actual Scripture (Matthew 8) Jesus admired and honored the man for his faith and humility.This is just another example of sloppiness and error with Scripture.",0
"Did We Really Need This Flick?: It's so typical that the notion of Michael Myers simply being born evil is essentially thrown out the window and replaced with the usual boy-within-a-dysfunctional-family deal. How very 21st century and how very lame. Besides the fact that I have been immune to these movies since the late 1980's, this film was a waste of my time. The only highlights were the appearances of Ken Foree (from the superior original version of ""Dawn Of The Dead"") and Micky Dolenz (of the 1960's band and TV show ""The Monkees""). Other than that, ho hum. It's also too long.Note to Hollywood: please stop with the remakes. Get some creative people in there and give us something new and fresh. Don't be afraid to try a worthwhile idea that does not require reaching back into the past. John Carpenter's superior ""Halloween"" was 1978. It should be left alone.",0
"Sturdy and Affordable: I've climbed nearly to the top of this latter, and it feels very secure. The shelf offers enough space to hold several items. Well worth the price.",1
"Very funny video: All four of my daughters love Jeff, these videos are great add ons for birthdays Xmas etc great family fun time watching",1
But nothing...: It was intended to be a book about how to cook EVERYTHING...but nothing I wanted to cook or eat.,0
"car 54 where are you: I was looking for thr old TV show for a friend, didn't realize this was the awful movie they made. it is horable",0
"Again...Lindsay Lohan did a great movie!!!: This movie, as well, is better than the past one of Lindsay Lohan ""Freaky Friday"". This time, Lohan acts like she never did, also, is another movie with Walt Disney Pictures. But, hey!...this movie is great to watch it over and over again. I f you want to watch a really good movie full-sized of comedy and hilarious things, don't even think in other movie, Just go and buy your tikets for 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen', believe me, it worths it!And don't forget to visit the official movie site: www.teenagedramaqueen.com, and to buy the Soundtrack on Stores now!, also available here on Amazon.com.- I know you'll like this movie!",1
"Ahhh.......No.......Didn't like it: There's something about her voice I just don't like. I can't figure out what...maybe it's that her voice sounds....like she's whining? I'm sorry. I bought the album, listened to it twice and haven't touched it since. Don't bother.",0
"The Phantom -- Billy Zane: This product was useless. The North Carolina company sent to me (in Texas) a region 2 PAL video. None of my 5 DVD readers can process it. I'm sure I should have been aware of the region stuff, but I have never encountered the problem before. I feel used...",0
"just like daddy: I bought this for my 3 1/2 y/o son, daddy has a real four wheeler so he was very excited. Never having rode a power wheel before I was kinda concerned how he would manuver it, but within an hour he was zippin around. It really is very durable, and has great traction for a power wheel he can go up small inclines, and through the yard with no problem. My 6 y/o will sometimes hop on the back, and ride with, and it shows no signs of slowing. He just loves it, and we all have a good time watching him it's so adorable. I would'nt hesitate to buy this.",1
Satisfied: This is just the item I was looking for. I had the cassette since it came out in the late 60's or early 70's. I would play it every Christmas season. I went to play it last Christmas and the tape broke. I had an unusable cassette. I found this on Amazon and now I can play it without worry. The seller sent it in a timely manner. It was great. I would buy from this seller again.,1
nightmare on elm street blu ray: I have to say a nightmare on elm street on blue ray is sick the color is awsome and the sound is awsomee nicely done a must have for horror fans got love evil horror that Scars u and Scars u again.,1
"Love it!: This is my second one as we misplaced the first one. Perfect for floating anywhere! I've had this on the beach, on the river and in the pool. Plenty large to fit drinks and snacks for our group of 4. Floats great no matter how full/heavy you pack it. Made of heavy plastic so no worries about leaks when it gets dragged to the gravel bar. We use the cooler alone as well. Soft sides make it easy to pack, it basically can collapse to the size of whatever is inside. Highly recommend this!",1
"Another appealing entry in this series.: The introduction of one of Brenda's ex-husbands was something that piqued my interest, though I'm not sure that I can picture the character of Brenda married to a character such as Nado. But, then, who knows what sometimes draws two people together? The twist at the end of the story, and the way it all came together, was something different. But not necessarily unusual for Brenda.",1
"Wrong CD: Arrived just in time for Christmas, but got sent, if you can believe this, Tour de France Soundtracks. Will never use again!",0
"Best: I mainly wanted a functional and cute folding step stool and this is the best I could find. It is a little larger than I expected...but I must not have looked at the measurements. I think it'll be a great addition to my place. Feels sturdy and is pretty cute. The box it came in was packaged poorly, but no damage was made.",1
"Great...for about 2 months: Bought these for my girlfriend. I, myself, prefer Klipsch but she gets what she wants. Great packaging and (deceptively) they appear to be very solid. The sound is almost comparable with the Klipsch S2 (more bass, but less crisp mids and highs) but not near the X10. My GF however, was happy with the style and performance .... for the approximately TWO MONTHS she used them before the left bud simply went out. When Monster claims that these earbuds are ""built to last"".... they left out the remainder of the sentence... ""built to last -- two months"".",0
"Not a Good Resource: This book originated in the 1800s and was authored by Joseph Smith. He took the Bible and changed the content by taking away parts, added his own words, copied parts from his own Book of Mormon, and in the end, published it as his ""New Translation"". I would NOT recommend this book. There are ""lot"" of study bibles and other resources that are much better.",0
"Poignant and relevant still.: There isn't anything I could say that hasn't already been said in the last sixty years. It's a short read. Short, poignant, and scarily accurate for today's world.",1
The Three Little Hawaiian Pigs and the Magic Shark: My favorite part of the story is when the shark dies. My second favorite part is when the shark dresses up like a lei seller. I would recommend this story because it's funny and has Hawaiian words. I would give this book five stars.,1
"A Tribute That's Great in Its Own Right: Quite unusual for someone my age (17), I came across this recent album as a result of my love for Gram Parsons's work with the Byrds and with the Flying Burrito Brothers rather than my acquiantence with the artists who perform on the tribute. This album was recomended to me by a friend who shares some of my tastes in music. I am satisfied with it and more. It is currently in the CD player in my car, and I see no plans in the foreseeable future of removing it, except maybe when I receive my copy of GP/Greivous Angel. The tracks are varied yet they fit together well. My favorite is probably ""She"" with the Pretenders and Emmylou Harris, or maybe ""Return of the Greivous Angel,"" or maybe... (the list goes on...)This album is a must for anyone who loves Gram Parsons's music, and highly recomended for anyone who's never heard of him. This is truly what Gram Parsons meant when he coined the term ""cosmic American music.""",1
"PC Repair book: Lots of useless information, got absolutely nothing worthwhile out of this book. Maybe it was just to basic for my needs. Not recommended.",0
"ADORABLE!!: My 6 and 4 year old daughters absolutely adore Nat & Alex Wolff, and I must admit that I do too! They are both so stinking cute, I could squeeze them silly ;) I find myself watching the show/movie when my kiddos have left the room at times. Very clean, fun entertainment for parents and kids to watch together. I love the interaction between Nat and Rosalina, Alex & Jesse and the sheer goofiness of Michael Wolff and that accordian ;) So much fun. These kids are all TRULY talented at acting and music alike. Great songs that keep your toes tapping...very infectious. The impromptu nature of the ""mockumentary"" film is captivating. Order it today!! Only snafu is that the bonus CD is *not* included as previously offered with the DVD. You have to request a copy of the 5 song CD from Paramount. But it ships via UPS quickly and my kids have just about worn a hole in it from repeated use :) We all LOVE it!",1
"What happened to sympathy?: The message from this books is: If you are stupid and have no individual thought processes, you will survive in the corporate world. If you have feelings, morals, and care about your fellow man, you could very well lose your job, or your cheese.It is a pretty sad state of affairs when the message of today's corporate world is look out for yourself!No one else matters! Don't be loyal to the organization because the organization doesn't care a hoot about you!I can't reccommend this book.",0
"Thought it was okay until mounting it to my tripod: At first I noticed that the build quality is a bit cheap, but I didn't mind because the plastic materials keep the weight down. The problem is that it doesn't connect well to the camera. There is too much play between the two parts (camera and battery pack). I also have an arca swiss style L bracket mounted to the camera and battery pack. When I mount the rig in my tripod's quick release plate and secure everything down you really see how flimsy this thing is. Handheld it's fine, but on a tripod there's just too much movement. I've decided I'll just keep an extra battery or two in my pocket and shoot verticals with the camera's shutter release.",0
"One of the worst: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The plotting is beyond belief and full of holes. People are dropping like flies and no one seems to care. Darius murders his own wife and little daughter in cold blood and still gets a pardon? Years later four other bodies are found in one place and police are heard laughing at the scene of the fifth murder, only a few days later. I could go on and on but just had to get this off my chest.",0
"Not Impeccable: Along with a group of tenured female colleagues, I take issue with MOST of the advice in this book--it's embedded with all manner of weird prejudice (fat people are better than thin people; men are always dangerous; Emily Toth is God). The book espouses feminism but violates the basic precepts of feminism--taking risks, being humane, celebrating self and others. Why does she so rarely answer questions constructively? A bunch of us suspect that she makes up the letters herself, by the way--which makes the answers even more ludicrous.All in all, this book is a curiously defensive, gutless approach to surviving academic life--not creative or provocative or even useful in terms of practical advice.",0
"steer clear of this unit!: I had gotten tired of using a 250GB external and decided to step up to the mack daddy and assume i wouldn't have to buy another external for five years. well, now after a little under a month of using this unit, it isn't recognized by any of my PCs. I've tried all of the recommended tweaks to get it back but now, i need to find a data reovery specialist and deal w/ Lacie's horrendous support. you would think when you drop a decent amount of change on something that the thing would at least make it a year before implosion. apparently other units have a decent track record but not this one. beyond disgusted...",0
excellent: I was very pleased with the purchase and the time it took to reach me. The condition of the book was excellent.,1
"Great while it worked: ***Updated Review***Ok, second and third ones lasted less than a year each as well. I'm finished doling out money for this piece of garbage. It's a good idea and I can't imagine why it can't be implemented in a way that would make it last for more than one month (unit number three) up to six (the first and second). These needs drastic improvement before it's worth spending money on.***Original Review***For the last six months I've loved this. It did it all. Unfortunately, it's now off by 75 degrees.

"A 'feel good' book with a life lesson...: In my quest to read all of James Patterson's books, I stumbled across this one in a bargin book store. This book is not the murder mystery he is known for - it's more like SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICOLAS.MIRACLE ON THE 17TH GREEN is set around golf - but don't worry about really understanding or having an appreciation of the game to read this book. This is a story about Travis McKinley who discovers he is not happy with his life and decides to make changes...starting with his job. The short story (only 150 pages) told in James Patterson style (short chapters) begins on one Christmas when Travis golfs the game of his life. From there his life begins to change - for the better. He discovers during the next year what really matters to him and his life takes on a clarity it has never had.A good book that proves Patterson can write a good story no matter what the subject!",1
"Wanted it to work, but caught no fleas whatsoever: Once I discovered fleas on my 7 year old dog, I immediately ordered this trap. I was excited to receive it, and its simple construction and setup were a breeze. The trap paper was incredibly sticky and tacky, but warped in such a way that it wouldn't lay flat on the bottom of the trap.I set up the trap next to my dog's bed area and the first few times I left the house, the trap's light was the only one left on. After several days, not a single flea was caught. The trap paper was still very sticky to the touch, and inspecting my dog revealed that he still had them!I bought monthly flea treatment instead, and noticed results within hours of application. My advice is to opt for a little extra expense for a more reliable solution.",0

"If you're here, you know...: Look, if you're reading this review, chances are you are someone you love really knows what the deal is about this show. It's smart, fun, sultry, touching, intelligent, has big explosions, great storylines, and great characters. If you're here, you're likely going to enjoy the DVD. Or whoever you're getting it for. Trust me.",1
"BAD VIDEO QUALITY: I bought this 'castaways pictures' version of the movie and yes, it is the movie in bad visual quality. If you are easily annoyed with this, use the money toward the purchase of a better quality copy, which I wish I did. Make your money count and don't waste your time.",0
"Depends: To begin, I am a die-hard fan of the Battle Angel Alita manga. When I first saw this 'episode' of the Battle Angel anime and the anime version of 'Tears of an Angel' I was very disapointed. I agree with the offcial reveiw that it is impossible to translate Yukito Kishiro's extensive manga into an animated format without losing the incredible artwork. However, the loss of the story is what disapointed me the most.I feel that the depth of the original plot is simply cheapened in the anime. The main villian (Makaku in the manga) has been replaced by a simple ""brain eating gladiator"". The intense scenes where Alita attempts to save Koyomi from Makaku are completly left out. The anti-hero Desty Nova, who plays a significant role in the later books, is also missing.If you have never read the manga, you may enjoy this.If you have read and enjoy the manga, you may want to save your money.",0
"wok strainer: This is a beautfully produced wok strainer that is made of stainless steel. I have used items like it in the past, but they were not stainless steel. I am very pleased with this stianless steel version and highly recommend it to everyone.",1
"Perfect for my uses: I bought this camera because of the small size, megapixles and zoom + digital zoom. I wanted something to take outdoors into the wilderness and not worry about hurting it. Price wise I feel this camera offers pleanty of featrues at a very reasonable price.",1
disappointing: There's no indication of how much your getting only the ingredients. I found the parent company and contacted them and they said it was to be used with a multi-vitamin and they couldn't give me the amount of ingredients either. At least the person I spoke wilth couldn't do that.,0
"Full of mistakes: It appears that some fool edited the cautionary examples for correctness. (p. 34) The grammar is poor (""verboten"" as a noun? (p. 85)), and the usage is non-standard (Commas are ""trundled out""? (p.37)). Some passages are self-contradictory (""With Adjectives, p. 37).This book is not a total disaster, but I can hardly recommend it.",0
"This cd is one that will put a smile on your face and ....: This is probably one of the greatest Sally Harmon cds around. I have really enjoyed this cd greatly. The songs are performed in a romantic manner. They make me feel young again. On this particular cd, Sally plays a lot of my favorite songs. These are the songs that I couldn't possibly ever grow tired of.Here again, Sally does mix classical and popular songs. As I have stated before, I would prefer all of one kind of song category to be performed on her cds. I won't hold this against Sally, but I should have a choice of what I listen to.I Would Like To Recommend This CD",1
"Terrible Quality: Have had these chairs for less than a year and we already need to replace them. They are broken and/or falling apart. The tops of the chairs have broken off more times than I can count and the legs are all wobbly and falling apart now too. They looked really nice when I first got them, but that didn't last. They still look nice if you can avoid looking at all the broken pieces and lopsided legs. Don't buy these chairs!!!",0
"No Good: This piccolo was purchased this summer. Considering the price we had no expectation that it would be professional sounding, but we did expect it would be playable. After struggling to play it and finally having someone else try to play it and then taking it to a music store to be looked at we found it will not be playable without extensive repair. Only 5 of the pads are somewhat in the correct position. If the pads are salvagable it will take at least $100 to attempt to fix. If the pads need to be replaced it will be upwards of $250 to repair. We purchased a Diplomat piccolo for $100 more than this one and it played beautifully the moment she picked it up. I wouldn't purchase anything sensitive like a piccolo without being able to play it again.",0
"The one and only: This is the best batman movie ever. I did like batman and batman returns, but the last two sucked. It looked like it will be a long time before we got to see another batman film. But then here came Christopher Nolen to give us something we have been waiting for. A batman film we can say is probably the best film and in my opinion the best comic boobk movie ever. Come on this beats spiderman 2 and fantastic 4.This goes into more detail of how bruce wayne became batman. And for some people they may bitch about that bruce isn't batman that much or may moke of how Christian Bale changes his voice but they don't know a good movie.I recommened this movie to anyone.",1

Text Books from Amazon-NEVER ORDER HERE: Tried to return a new workbook for my daughter who is a freshman at Stanford University. The ISBN# on line from Amazon(not a private seller) was not the correct ISBN# for the wookbook. Would not return or refund an unopened new item. Never try and order a textbook or workbook from Amazon. It's like flushing cash down the toilet.,0
"Cheaply derivitive: A supervisor at Boston's Logan airport is murdered and union ramp agents are suspected. This is the premise of Hard Landing, and a clever one it would be if it weren't taken from a real-life crime. Heitman acknowledges her ""inspiration"" once during the novel by (shamelessly) citing the real murder as part of her narrative. One wishes she at least would have chosen a venue other than Boston for her novel, but being that the author worked at Logan for years I guess the familiarity was too great and the imagination required to transport the scenario somewhere else too daunting. Having said that, it was an entertaining enough read, but being somehwat familiar with the real-life murder kind of ruined it for me. Kind of tramples on the grave at worst and lacks imagination at best.",0
"PHIL COLLINS' SOLO ALBUM: Phil Collins took total control of Genesis and one of the results is this tasteless album, totally comercial-orientated. The only two catchy worth songs are the title track and ""ANYTHING SHE DOES"". This seems another band, this is no Genesis at all, it seems a Phil Collins solo album. You can almost begin to hear he starting to compose his soundtracks for Disney... Blergh !",0
"Ok: It was ok, but not great. I had to have it for a web class. It was easy enough to read, but I didn't enjoy it.",0
good product: This makes it much easier and convenient to cook eggs in the morning. Very easy to figure out how many minutes needed to boil a soft or hard egg. Simple but smart design. The only thing that I'd like this one to improve on is that it will be better if it uses stainless steel instead of aluminum for the inside.,1
"Enjoyable and thought-provoking story: For some reason, I find myself returning to this book about once a year to re-read it. It's a short and easy read, but it's length is deceptive. Lewis is an excellent observer of the human condition and this allegory is very thought provoking. Written over 40 years ago, it still stays fresh.I would highly recommend this book.",1
4 hours = DEAD: It took our 10 month old mutt puppy FOUR hours to rip through this thing. She was already snapping off pieces of the rubber and trying to swallow them. There are so many positive reviews - either we got a lemon or else our puppy is truly a monster.,0
"Heartbreaking: Heartbreaking story starring John Cuasck (playing mostly against type). His wife ('Grace') has been killed serving in Iraq, but he's too overwhelmed himself to bring himself to tell his two young daughters about it. So instead he decides to take them on a road trip to Disneyland (or the generic movie-equivalent). Surprisingly non-political, other than the fact that it helps bring home the message that behind every fleeting headline of war casualties, there are hundreds of lives that are devastated and forever changed.I always have a tough time finding movies to watch on planes, given the violence and/or sexual content of so many adult films. I thought this would be a safe one to watch (and it was). But I'm sure the woman sitting next to me was wondering why I was crying in my seat at the end of the film.",1
"Big dissapointment: I was looking so forward to trying the chocolate mint flavour. Unfortunately, it doesn't taste very good. The taste is not very strong and very artificial tasting. A true dissapointment from dymatize who are known for having some of the greatest tasting proteins around.",0
"Buy the Special edition verion, NOT THIS VERSION!: The resason for me giving this film only 2 stars is that in the middle of the film, you have to flip it over to watch the second half. This is VERY frustrating. Buying the special edition version, you won't have to worry about this. This is a great film and I wonder who the brilliant mind behind this version's editting is (i.e.- cutting the film in two parts).",0
AMERICAN BOXE IS MUCH BETTER: THIS BOOKS DOESN'T TALK THE TECHNIQUES OF THE WING CHUN KUNG FU. YOU ONLY USE YOUR HANDS IN FIGHTS THAT NOWBODY FIGHTS LIKE THAT. IF YOU WANNA LEARN HOW TO USE YOUR FISTS TRAIN YOURSELF IN AMERICAN BOXE. THIS BOOKS IS NOT A KUNG FU BOOK.,0
"Not durable: I was very pleased with this product when i first got it, but it fell apart very quickly. the wires all all started showing, and eventually those wires then bent and distorted the sound quality until it ultimately broke. if you plan on using this frequently, and not leaving your iPod sitting in your car at all times, wear and tear will ruin this device quickly. i would not recommend it.",0
"Mobius: I have seen some short films and a this movie done by Joaquin,it may not have a huge hollywood style to it.But the story is well writen,directed and he seems to pick just the right actors to get across the story the way he invisioned it.He has a unique way of getting to the truth of things and it shows in the way he sets his films up and that he isnt afraid to push the limits to get his vision to the person watching.What he has done is taken issues that are not mainstream and tells them in a way that draws you in.The actors,story,and the simple way of shooting that movie,makes MOBIUS just another worth watcing movie.Its not for everyone but, but everyone can take a little someting away from it.",1
"This show really stinks !: I thought I would give this show a chance since all of my favorite SyFy shows have been getting cancelled left and right lately.So I really tried to get into this show, but after 2.5 seasons I still cant sit through 1 episode without changing the channel.The show is boring and the writing is bad.The actors themselves are pretty good, but it does not make up for the bad writing !The show is just plain boring !",0

"""Bruise"" by Oleander (please help me locate!): Hi,I loved this soundtrack and would have given 5 stars if only ""Bruise"" by Oleander (the song they play after the party when all the couples - and triples in Stifflers case! - are in bed) was included. I know that this is a rare B side but surely they know that people are going to want access to a song when it is in a movie, so why not make the thing available? There are so many movies with good music that is either left out of the OST or cannot be obtained in any other way. Another example is the song ""Is it hot in here?"" which is in the movie Mystic Pizza. Anyway, if anyone knows of a download site for Bruise or has a CD they could burn me a copy of etc. I would LOVE it. Please email me at 87311206@scholar.uws.edu.au if you have any info.Thanks,Ricky",1
"wonderful book: when i read annis's baby i thought that it was a wonderful book . it taught you stuff like having baby's, what's love and many other things. and it really caught me and it was a page turner.",1
"This is the one to go on!: I've been listening to ""Sister Sweetly"" for the past few days, and have yet to grow tired of it. You'll love this album if you are at all into rock/blues/soul. Passionate emotions are combined with catchy, sometimes hypnotizing melodies. ""Bittersweet,"" probably the most well-known song by this little-known band, is as the title suggests, and powerfully emotional. ""Circle"" is both a passionate plea (""I'm asking you to turn around""), and a thought-provoking statement about life in general (""Rise and fall, turn the wheel, cause all life is is really just a circle""). ""Ellis Island"" surprises you with its melodic twists and turns. ""Tomorrow Never Comes"" may be my favorite. It is quiet, haunting, beautiful even, with its soft percussion, quiet piano riff, and masterful and emotional vocals. Passionate and soulful, this is Big Head Todd at their best. I very much recommend it.",1
"Not a good value for the price.: 1. Memory sold with the camera is only 16M( 8 shorts of high resolution). You'll have to spend extra $40 to get 512M, so you can use all features you paid in that camera( video, and 2048x1536 resolution ).2. You'll need an extra battery, since Canon will just tell you - ""Cnange battery"" and shut the camera. Their recharge warning will not warn you agead of time. ( Add extra $40 for extra battery ).3. You'll need, an AC adaptor, when uploading or connecting camera to TV ( add another $40 ).So, the price of the camera will have to be 50% more or extra $120, or you get a car without gas and a spair.",0
Wrong record: The only review of this CD was obviously of the vinyl version as the tracks on the audio CD version are totally different. Was there never a CD version of the vinyl record released and if so why doesn't Amazon have it?,0
"Surprisingly excellent!: I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this album. I knew ""Hot Smoke and Sassafras"" was a great tune, but thinking of my experience with many of the one hit wonder records of the genre, I had low expectations. This album is very solid and should have been a great party album for its time. Very reminiscent of Love especially their post ""Forever Changes"" period. Buy it if you are into that kind of thing or if you just like ""Hot Smoke"". The rest of the album supports it very well. Some of the bonus tracks kick butt too!",1
"Dissapointed in Software: We were very happy when we received this product and were happy that we made a good investment, until we start using it .....Unfortunately, when we started using the GPS and start getting lost in places which were built 2 years ago, we found out the software was quite old and was sold in a new package. There has been a lot of construction in North Florida lately and this GPS got us lost in 50% of the places we went to. Garmin should be very careful in promoting the new design with a old software. We had bought GPS primarily for traveling purposes and rest of the features were added benefits which made us choose this product among many others, like Tom Tom, NavMan, etc. etc.We had to return the unit as it was useless for us. Amazon was very professional and took the return in a timely fashion.Garmin makes great products but make sure that the software has a updated version before you buy one next time.PM",0
"Absolutely stunning story.: Gripping and provocative mystery of successful Maine shipping family during the late nineteenth century, Cameron's Landing focuses on Lorna, the new governess and amateur sleuth. Story is fast paced, engrossing, and moves to love story type ending for Lorna and Alex, the youngest Cameron heir. Cameron's Landing could be cited as Anne's best and is a must for faithful Anne Stuart fans. If you can't locate a copy, try the auctions.",1

"a great, unforgettable read: I was told about 10 years ago to read this book. (if i could ever find it) i searched for it for 10 years. A hardcover edition came my way. I clutched it and read it all weekend. I loved every word. The author conveyed some very basic feelings. Feelings that make for a complete relationship and committment. I gave my hardcover edition to a ""David"" of my own. I was lucky enough to get another one. Everyone i know is on the lookout for this book, for me.",1
"A DVD Nightmare: I CAN NOT stress enough that the dub version chopped half the original show. And one would think that after the wonderful release of the Sailormoon S and SS seasons, the classic season DVD's would be just as great-think again! Not only are the episodes in dub format only, the covers in my opinion are nothing compared to the previous DVD covers, and the titles are ridiculous! ""A Heroine Is Chosen""? Get real! They could've at least said something like, ""Sailor Moon- Classic Collection I"", even that would be OK. The only somewhat ""good"" thing about the *""classic dub"" DVDs is that they aren't $26....4-5 dubbed episodes isn't worth the money. I only gave it 1 star because they actually released it, cheaply too-in both price AND quality. Three words: A DVD nightmare!*""classic dub""- I don't consider the chopped-up dub of Sailormoon Classic, classic. Tragic maybe, or even ""The Nightmare Collection"".",0
"This Slbum Aucks!: First of all, in order to have any credibility, Little T needs to change his name to ""Lil' T."" Being articulate gets you nowhere on the street, where i'm sure Little spends much of his time, ""hanging out"" and ""pretending to be a pot-head."" The antiquated use of the phrase ""shut up, Beavis"" is also most distressing. Young T compounds his offenses against taste with each track, delving deeper and deeper into the nether regions of wackness. He reveals to the listener the raw passion and angst that can only be developed through a long, hard adolesence of video games and talking about, but not actually getting, laid. I'm sure that not ALL of his boasting is false though. For example, he probably actually HAS consumed beer before, i'll give him that much credit. Did i mention his lack of anything resembling lyrical skill? He's like the suburbs' answer for Nate Dogg. Thank God this is Little T's last album.",0

"Soap Opera: In the same style of literature as Pride and Prejudice comes the horrendously acclaimed story of Jane Eyre. This book was incredibly boring and had several major flaws in the plot. It also had several gothic elements in it, must like the new twists soap operas are adding recently (people possesed by the devil, etc.) This book isn't bad; there are much worse. Time would certainly be better spent reading something else.",0
"Can't tell you how much I hate this CD: As some of the other reviewers have stated, I really wanted to like this CD. I keep putting into my CD player, but by the 4th song I can't stand it anymore! This CD has a very cheesy, hokey sound with silly lyrics that I just can't get into. I really can't see why it has received so many good reviews. Save your money!",0
"Big disappointment: The fact that this was in the Wayside Gardens series mislead me. When the book arrived I discovered that it was written by a Britisher for the British gardener and that 3/4 of the plant material was not useable in the mid-Atlantic region.The pictures are sumptuous, but the content is just not relevant for the American gardener - unless, of course, you are on the Pacific Coast!",0

If I had, I wouldn't have bought it. I must say, this CD really blows, and Conor Oberst couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. It's really funny, too, how all the negative reviews on Amazon are deemed not helpful,even when they are right on the money. When people are determined to throw their money away, they don't want to hear any dissenting opinions. Believe me:this CD is garbage, and Conor Oberst is all hype.",0
"Run of the mill: I was very interested in getting this DVD to see more of what Kelly was all about but was disappointed. I found her charisma lacking. She isn't that pretty to look at -- I'd rather watch Christina or Britney for the look and the moves. Though a good singer, Kelly's style is nothing new, and in fact, falls flat. That is, she is not a standout in today's crowded music scene. Sadly, I found her boring. I thought she may have something more to offer, but I guess from now on, I'll be sticking to Pink, who has an awesome voice, who has an interesting persona and has that something extra.",0
Gunsmoke-The Firs t Season: I enjoyed watching this DVD as I watched it probably when I was young.The early segments showed Matt and Kitty s o young as oppossed to later ones.

"Essence of the Sea: This is a delicious kombu kelp. Soak it in tepid water for a half hour and it's ready to use, with an aroma that will bring back memories of any coastline. I use mine in making dashi stock as well as for eating directly.Be careful with the packaging, though. This comes as two separate sealed packages of seaweed bundled together with tape and cellophane; you don't want to pierce both inner packages until you're ready to use them, of course.",1
"Decent Case: Case starts out being tight and difficult but after a few days use it stretches and becomes quite usable. My remedy was just to place the harmonica (also a Special 20) in the case with the last 1/4"" or so not stuffed all the way in. If you're expecting this to be like a gun holster for quick draws, you will be disappointed. If you want a simple piece of protection for the instrument that can be tossed in your pocket or a backpack without consuming the space of the larger plastic case - then this will do nicely. I carry it with me essentially everywhere. It keeps the harp clean and secure.",1
"Could fit into about 10 pages....: There is really no reason for this book to be as long as it its. Not that it is incredibly long, but the whole book could easily be summed up in less than 10 pages. It is very repetitive, and chalked full of filler, explaining the same thing over and over again.Here's my one sentence summary of the book:The typical millionaire owns their own business, is married, drives a used car, lives well below their means, and is very modest with their wealth.The whole point of the book is to explain that the typical millionaire does not live like Donald Trump. I guess it is geared for people who have never thought about that concept before? Other than generating a book to sell, I can't see why it would take so many pages to explain this fact.",0

"For Alaskan Malamute Lovers Only: This is the only one of the series that I've read, and now I doubt I'll bother with the others. Conant has hung a bunch of red-herring plot twists and turns on a simplistic semi-mystery that in the end is nothing more than a guilty-family-secret story. Nazis, eugenics, dog shows in the thirties, a Rockefeller heiress, the Isabelle Stewart Gardner museum -- all turn out to be irrelevant to the story line....",0
"THE best starter book for special effects make-up!: My very beaten copy is dated 1965, from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Every other book I've read or owned on the subject has been a supplement.

Terrific twists and turns: This is a really good story. I feel weird because I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps. Gorgeous latin women!My first Spanish soap was called ROSALINDA and it's awesome too!Only problem is that there are 5 discs and I thought that the last disc did not have English subtitles so I had to guess the end of the story by watching just the acting. Turns out the English Subtitle ON is buried in one of the bonus material so I turned it on and watched it again with english subtitle.Music soundtrack is wonderful.,1
INJUSTICE: How could a record company release anything like this from one of the greatest singers of all time is beyond me .. Marvin must be turning over in his grave after this one ..

"NOT MADE AS GOOD AS BEFORE: We've owned the same previously for the last 5 years and the tube finally punctured spraying water out below the stand. Purchased this new one which is supposed to be the same but what a BIG dissapointment. Turning up the power knob to the maximum of 5, this didn't even provide anymore pressure out of the nozzle than a setting of 3. This one is much noisier than our first Water Jet. They must have some third world country putting these together. I would not recommend purchasing this model.",0
"Love Them, but runs large for women: These are nice shoes, but they run large. They flop around on my foot, and I'll have to get some inserts to take up some of the room in the toe-box. I wish I could send these back for the smaller size, but I already wore them.LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE! The UK sizes are hard to deal with since they don't have half-sizes. I finally figured out with my last few purchases (after 15 years of wearing them):If you are ordering a model MADE FOR WOMEN go to the next whole size bigger (i.e. US 7.5, should order a US 8)If you are ordering a UNISEX pair go DOWN a half size (i.e. US 7.5, get US 7)",1
"Best Wrestlemania ever!!: In my opinion, the greatest wrestlemania in history. It had everything from a great (huge & loud) crowd to a main event featuring the biggest stars of our or any other time.All the matches were good but my top 5 are as follows1. Rock v Austin - One of the greatest matches of all time2. Angle v Benoit - A superb wrestling exibition, way better then their royal rumble match.3. Shane v Vince - A trumendous effort by both men that did justice to a very interesting storyline going into this match.4. HHH v Undertaker - first time these 2 badasses locked up. 10/105. TLC match - ruthless hardcore match, that on any other night, would of stolen the show.Do yourself a favour, buy WM17",1
"WARNING--MISLEADING TITLE: I post this simply as a warning to buyers, after being misled myself: the title and the names of the plays (prominently displayed on the cover) would lead you believe, as I did, that this is a collection of those plays, like The Best American Short Stories or something of that sort. Far from it. This is a theater yearbook, and the plays are represented by essays about them--certainly not what I thought I was getting. This packaging is clearly [misleading].I give it one star rather than none because it represents a good deal of honest work, and it probably has some merit on its own terms...",0
"Loved it for about 6 months!: Our son received this toy when he was about 3. He loved it. Learned how to use it very quickly. It is a great educational tool and teaches kids computer skills at a young age without potential damage to your own computer! We were very pleased with it. As far as functionality and educational value we liked it more than any other educational toy he has had, including Leapster 2, Tag, and Tag Junior. Then one day it stopped working. It lasted about 6 months. Our son is unusually careful with his toys, and we put it back on the shelf under the TV after each use, so there was no damage to the device. This was very disappointing. Considered buying another one, but why waste the money?",0
Bonfire: I love tingle and this is a pretty stong tingle. It made me feel and look like instant results. It smells wonderful also.,0
"Terrible Camera!: I bought this camera for a little guy who was showing a real interest in photography. After just a few minutes w/ it, he put it down - I don't blame him. It's an awful little camera - pictures are terribly grainy and the flash washes everything out! It also picks up no color.It was a sad, sad Birthday present!",0
Great tool: I recevied this for my birthday and I have been very pleased with it. I have not had the opportunity to use it yet but is well made and is very balanced.,1
"Timex GPS: I bought this GPS for running because I didn't like the clunky watches, and the price was reasonable. The unit is very accurate, but it does lose the satellite feed if I am running in a area with a lot of trees. Also, it takes about five minutes to pick up a satellite feed when I first go out. The Timex watch that goes with the GPS unit is easy to use and has more functionality that I'll ever need. Overall, it's a good value.",1
"Great product!: A friend at work bought a set of these after trying other kinds of ""cleats"" and recommended these highly. Based on that and the other user reviews I bought 4 pair. 1 for me and the other 3 for family members. Everyone reports positive experiences with them on both snow and ice.My own experience is that they work exactly as described. Traction is incredibly enhanced over several different footwear I've tried them on. I've tried these in just snow and a combination of snow and ice and traction is significantly improved. I havent tried them on pure ice yet, but I could seem them working very well there as well.Pro's:- Price- recycled and reduced packaging- easy to slip on and off- easy to clean/dry- can use inside (not recommended for a long time)Con's:- Made in China- the small size could take some effort to stretch on, so if the person is elderly it might take a bit to do this (maybe put on before putting shoe on can help).",1
"Best resource available on phonological awareness!!!: I've read numerous books and articles about phonological awareness, and this one is by far the best! It provides a lot of important information in a way that is accessible to anyone, beginning teacher or veteran. There are loads of activities for the classroom, too. I really like how the book is organized into the levels of phonological awareness (word, syllable, onset-rime, and phoneme). This makes it easy to select activities based on the developmental level of my students. I highly recommend this book to all teachers of kids in preschool, kindergarten, first grade, or even second or third grade. Some of the activities would even be appropriate for older kids who are still having a hard time with the basics.",1
"Distant and Removed, Very Disappointing!: The hype about this book is just that hype! There are better books available to discuss the loss of life but it seems when you are a famous person you can immediately rise to the top. I was truly disappointed in the story although the illustrations are very well done. I think the illustrator should receive the credit for any success this book attracts!",0
"OH I LOVELOVELOVE this game!!!: This game so rocks! I've never loved a game so much as this. I can personalize the car to my taste in style/colour/etc! I was so happy with the first, but this one just rocks as much!Also the fact that you have to drive around to find the races, (you'll understand when you play it) and the garages. The only bad part is waiting until you unlock the 'better' things to make your car hotter then it already is.The graphics are very nice, and the music is good, maybe the first NFS:Underground soundtrack was a *bit* better. lol But it was good nonetheless.Anyways, this is surely worth getting if you love racing!",1
Love comes Softy: Love Comes Softly was a good book. An enjoyable read with likeable characters and realistic settings. A nice period book.,1

"Could have been better, if a real Puerto Rican wrote it.: I am a Puerto Rican also, who grew up, knowing about all the different branches of our heritage... Yes, there are Puerto Rican, who hate other races... like everyone else... but, you know what? Not all of us are that way... I am proud to be called a ""Boricua"", which apparently, the writer of this low rated movie, does not know where that nickname came from...I have to agree with these people, who have written their comments... this movie is an insult to our loving culture, that has whites, blacks, even asian descendants, coming to full circle, in our daily lives. We live in the same neighborhood, and still, we get along.So, when you pick this video... make sure you know, that this is not the real Boricuas here.",0
"Love this DVD!: Wow! What a great product. I am just starting out learning Delta Blues guitar and really wanted to learn ""I'll Go With Her"". I use tabs though I can read music I am very slow at it. Actually, I am slow at learning through tabs as well but coupled with the video instruction, it was a breeze. I mastered the song much more quickly than with tab alone and really enjoyed the teaching style of John Miller. I understand now what country blues players mean when they say a student needs to learn from another player.",1
"My absolute favorite purple hair dye: I've had my hair a multitude of different colors over the years, and my favorite was always this color. I was so sad when my local beauty supply chain stopped carrying this line (back when it was still in a squeeze tube). I'm so excited that it's available relatively inexpensively online, as I've just recently gone back to purple (it was always my color :-P)",1
You've Got To Be Kidding Me: I took this author's course at CSUS back in 1991 and found him to be insufferably arrogant and cynical. He assigned this book in his class and I recall it being impenetrable. Pretentious rhetoric covering up incoherent arguments. I've noticed one of the used copies is going for $0.01. Overpriced if you ask me.,0
mad max: this film is one of my all time favorites but i have to say the picture quality of the video is very poor i am needless to say dissapointed,0
"schmuck rock: this is just another one of many albums aimed at teens that offers the standard format of fifth chords and poppy vocals. luckily the average teen grows out of this nonsense and realizes that the screaching, off kilter nature of this album is dull, lifeless and has been played out by countless other ""punk"" bands. any releases that are put out by these MTV mainstays should get an ""F"".",0
"My favorite Sonny Rollins recording: I love this album, having had the LP for over 25 years. St. Thomas is so great, I wore out the grooves on that one, check out Max Roach's drum solo... Sorry, but I hate the way the other Amazon review starts out: ""Though he lacked.."" Give me a break! Rollins is one of the top jazz players of all time. Superlatives only, please.",1
"The Cadillac of Irons makes ironing fun!: I'm a guy, and I have to admit, when my girlfriend convinced me to purchase a new iron to upgrade my small travel iron for my shirts, I was skeptical and felt that spending more money was just wasteful. But I had a coupon, someone I knew recommended the Rowenta brand, and so I purchased this thing.wow! It does a great job! Ironing is much easier and actually a little fun, as crazy as that sounds. This generates a ton of steam, it heats up very quickly and has a light to tell you when the it's ready for use. It is virtually spillproof as the there is a spring loaded top on the hole where you pour the water into the iron. It's heavy enough to provide some solid weight for the clothes, but not too heavy to make it difficult to move.If you're in the market for an iron, try this one out and you won't be sorry!",1
"Not shipped with a cold pack: This is the first time I have ordered this product and was surprised when I read the label which states, ""Culturelle must not exceed 75 degrees fahrenheit."" It was not shipped with a cold pack, so who knows how hot this product got in transit. So I am returning it and buying it from a local brick-and-mortar store instead.

"Another Bay Area Artisist that Ain't Never Been Heard: Straight game, straight dope, straight dank off them pimpin luscious beats provided by Khayree, laced with the broker than dumb English of Ray Luv. An instant classic that I, sadly, slept on back in 1995. Only heard this classic now, and it beats out today's ""marquee"" rap stars by a 1000 miles and then some more. Buy this got' damn album and soak some mofo'n game from that YBB star Ray Luv.",1
"Love Murad: I use this cream even with my acne prone skin and it is amazing. I cannot imagine using any other product, other than Murad since I have switched. I am sensitive to a lot of things including vitamin C and high concentration of retinol. My skin has cleared up and stayed clear since I have transitioned. It is well worth the money. I use an anti aging acne serum underneath and this, as my nightly routine. Some people have said they don't see the anti aging benefits - I disagree as sometimes one doesn't know what type of damage or aging effects people are trying to correct or reverse. I have used anti aging products with minimal sun exposure for about 10yrs and using Murad definitely maintains my youthfulness in its current form... My aging is certainly not any more noticeable so it must be doing something. I buy from MD Solutions, they ship fast and are reliable for lower cost Murad than retailers.",1
Now I'm afraid of Clowns: This and The Stand are my two favorite books in all the world. What can I say? Masterful!,1
Un clasico de todos los tiempos: Complacido con lo que recibi. Este es un CD que todo aquel amante de la buena musica POP en ingles debe tener. Recomiendo escucharlo cuando se va conduciendo por la carrera en un viaje largo y extenuante.,1
"Not very smooth: My little girl is crazy about rocks! This was her big present for Christmas one year. It took seven days to produce just a few rocks and they weren't even very shiny. There were several processes she had to do over the seven days, and we had to keep it turned on and going the whole time. She never played with it again, because the results were not worth the effort.",0

"Captivating piece of work: While the producers of the film took considerable license with Forester's one novel on which the four episodes were based, the results are most worthy. But the fourth episode leaves the viewer up in the air. Are more episodes to come next season, with the same actors? The production values are simply magnificent, especially in the shots of the tall ships at sea. Eat your heart out, Titanic. On the whole, the acting was excellent, most notably from the actor who played Capt. Pellew. Now we can only wait and hope for episode five et seq.",1
"Wonderful Iron: Does a great job, makes ironing quick and easy. I had a Black and Decker iron that was in use for over 25 years, and I am glad that I stuck with the brand!",1
"Not worth it!: I was pleasantly surprised to receive this DVD as a christmas present, but upon watching it I had to change my mind. Who makes these ""best of DVDs?"" This is the second one I've gotten that has been completely off. It's like someone just compiled a bunch of random sketches that had Steve Martin in it and threw them together in this DVD. They definitely weren't the best of. Not only that, many of them were from the same 2007 (? I'm guessing here) performance he did when he was promoting ""Pink Panther"". For someone who has hosted SNL over 14 times, there should be a lot more footage to throw in other than stuff from that one performance.Save your money and wait till something better comes out.",0
"Don't waste your time and money.: The reason I bought this book was the title: Counter Sniper. As a former rifleman, counter sniper is the most difficult task. This book has zero info about counter sniper. However, the info about sniper operation in this book is very basic; at least nothing new for me. That just total waste my time. Some other sniper experience history books would be better reading material if you are into this subject.",0
"Eye opening, very helpful: The Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships: Decoding Social Mysteries Through the Unique Perspectives of AutismAs the parent of 2 children and a husband with Asperger's, this book (I've read many)has many Aha moments. Very well written and very insightful. A must read for parents, teachers, etc. who work with children with Autism and Aspergers. I originally bought this book to help my now teenage boys with the social aspects of growing up but I have learned just as much if not more about how they look at life.",1
The missing CD: I have this album on vinyl and love it. But I have had it on my wishlist hoping to get it on cd. Is it available or not? Why is it so difficult to locate? The album is comprised mainly of Motown ballards done ala Smokey. Very romantic and vert soothing.,1
"used but just like new: The book was in excellent condition. If I didn't know any better I would have thought it wasn't used. The pages were not folded and it wasn't written in, like most books. It was delivered on time.(Great Service) This is also an interesting book. It kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to read more and more.",1
buyer beware: The description for this book does not mention it is a 16 page chintzy paper back. I cant believe some people are charging 25 to 35 dollars for this nickle booklet because that is all it is. I wish I would have had this information before I bought it.,0
Ugh.: I had to order this product twice. The first time Amazon shipped it 4 of my glasses arrived broken. Asked for a replacement....5 glasses were broken.Just the other day I was washing a glass out and it popped on my hand. Had to be rushed to the hospital because the laceration was so deep and big. I currently have 9 stitches. I don't feel comfortable with these glasses anymore.They were fine at first...now...I need a better thicker glass to help my worries go away.,0
Great Fun!: This book is great fun and a good companion to Barbie: A Visual Guide to the Ultimate Fashion Doll. It is great fun for a teacher of ESOL students and girls about the age of 3rd graders. The children will love it and I have classic Barbies and clothes to share!,1
"Great Food!: Previously, I fed my collie puppy with Purina Pro Plan, but after suggestions from friends who also own dogs, I decided to try out Wellness. The most distinct difference is that this food doesn't smell, the texture and the size is more suitable for a puppy to thoroughly chew before swallowing, and my dog likes it better than Purina. Also, the puppy's feces no longer smell and it makes much less of a chore to clean up her mess. It's been 2 months since the change, and my puppy is doing very well.",1
Audrey is the Gal: Most of the movies are classics and I love Audrey. If I was able to make my own selection of her films it would be better.,1
"so far so good: It might still be too early, but I think this product might be very good. I've tried it so far on my dog who has bad itchy flaky skin and his skin seems to have improved. I will continue to use it. Seems like a fairly good product compared to the dozens I've tried.",1
"Lens hood: I use this on my 50mm 1.8 mark 1, it fits well but it's a little difficult to put on as you have to press two buttons and sometimes it doesn't work well. I like that you can out it on backwards, saves me a lot of room in my bag.",1
"Awesome sound! Superb camera angles & cinematography !!!: As a musician I must say this is absolutely SUPERB!The camera angles & cinematography.... will blow you away!The sound though.... ""IS AWESOME"", especially if you have a great sound system.I've been a long time fan of Djavan for over 20 years, this is a KILLER CONCERT DVD. He's been often referred to as the""Stevie Wonder of Brasil""...... perhaps so as far as popularity and being dearly loved by masses not just in Brasil, but around the world..... however Djavan IS UNIQUE unto himself.",1
"Don't waste your money: I almost bought this at the store but I pulled it out of the bag first to look at it and ~ick~ the fabric is rough! It's not 100 percent cotton it's 50/50 polycotton, and thin. Worst of all, the pattern was improperly screen printed on it so the princesses were all blurry. You'd be better off buying a plain pink all cotton set and ironing on the princesses or whatever else you want.",0
Hard to understand some of the techniques: I didn't like it. Some techniques are hard to get or not explained very well. Better info can be found free on the net.,0
another outstanding book!: this is agreat book about a kid named Jhose and everything is way diffret he has never heard of snow or bad behavior. because in his community that is not heard of. no one has birthdays they just have group units and every december their are ceramonys and like your first ceromony you become a 1 and are given a name one you become a 12 you are given your job. and when Jhones becomes a 12 he is given a speical job.,1
"No Solutions: I made my selection based on the editoral review. However, I found the review very misleading. This is a picture book with practically no text, not even captions for the pictures. All of the text would probably fit on 10 pages and most of the pictures are too small to show much detail. Very disappointing to say the least. Imagine watching a movie on a 9"" screen with the volume turned off.",0
"Don't even rent it.: I bought this game thinking it would be like the one for gamecube. This game is knothing like it. Its pretty much imposible to to the search missions because there are no maps. The touch screan could be used as one but it is not, insted it is used to select special move to do when you press R, and there are only three you start out with and the others are preaty much imposible to get. In conclusion this is one of those games that might be fun playing at gamestop of target for five mintites but after that you will probubly never want to play it again.",0
Mr. Blue: Re-Stock It will not ship this product as advertised. They claim it is offered through someone else's error and promised several weeks ago to remove it. It is still here. They shipped one of four cartridges and when questioned they had it picked up and promised a refund.Call me Mr. BlueDon't bother trying to buy this bargain.,0
"Great Condition!: I got this book thinking it would have a little bit of wear and tear on it. Nope, looks like I just got it for new!! It also came in a timely fashion. Very satisfied.",1
"not worth the paper its written on: Conspiracy; thats what the whole thing relies on. I could sit here and make up any connection to any thing and find some way to say there is a connection, but guess what? There isn't.",0
"February 16, 1997: This book was great! It tells all about Benidict Arnold. He is a VERY interesting boy. If you really like reading about Revolutionary Heros, then this is a good book to read. Of course you might not be able to call him a hero when you find out what happens at the end. This book tells all about Benidict, before, after, and during the war. Even if you don't like reading non-fiction, you will now. For instance, did you know that Benidict was obsessed with shoes? Or that he killed his own horse because he didn't want to give it to the British? Or that the woman he married was involved in a terrible scandal? Well, if this sound intriguing... READ IT!!!",1
"Great book ""dumb"" title!: Aside from the obnoxious title these books are actually quite informative. They break down the basics of ferret nature and care in a way that is easy to read and understand. I would, however, put a book cover on it before placing it on my bookshelf; there is no seen to announce to the world that I am a ""dummie"" in any area. ;)",1
Another great Yarbro book: The story reminds me somewhat of another author's book I collect:Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged - but not as personally detailed. But this is still a very good story - as are all of Yarbro's books.,1
"Doesn't have Auto-Reverse: I bought mine used on Amazon, from a very fast shipping vendor. Nice enough people, but the description on Amazon needs to be changed. I specifically searched for a walkman with ""auto-reverse"" so i could listen to my uncle's old jazz tapes on repeat while i'm around the house (played through stereo, since i no longer have a tape deck). The unit works well enough, it just doesn't have auto reverse. that's the only reason for my ""1 star"" review. other than that it's ok.",0
"What a waste!: Tempted by the cover and the promise of a hot read I picked up No Surrender...Only to be bitterly disappointed.This is not a book I can or want to recommend to any reader of quality romance novels.Some might buy this for its many sex scenes, but please DON'T! They are not hot. They are violent, cruel and humiliating. They are unpleasant and not exiting!The rest of the book is not much better. The main characters were forced to have sex with each other. The sex turned out to be so good that they fell in love and didn't forget it for the years they were separated. Okay, it's a romance novel. But why does the heroine need to be so stupid? When her hero returns she doesn't welcome him with open arms, but hides their child from him and tells him lies after lies. Too many misunderstanding and constant anger and mistrust force them then into scenes of sex, sex, sex. Unbelievable.Nope, I really didn't like this book. What a shame as I wanted it to be entertaining and sexy.",0
"Not her best, but enjoyable: I was waiting for it, and I wasn't disapointed ; even if it's not the best, it's a good one, dark, and with good atmosphere. I just regret to see Lucy go down so much ...",1
"CD Great, DVD has it problems: While the CD is obviously fantastic, experiencing the same DVD production issues as detailed by the two reviewers from Texas. This is very disappointing as the content is sensational, but extremely difficult to watch. Have Warner release any info about this issue?????",1
"Almost every sentence is worthy of a 'quote of the day'.: This book, as with all other books Barbara Marciniak has written,is full of PROFOUND wisdom.You can randomly open to a page and start reading a sentence and go WOW, that was worthy of a 'quote of the day'. Then you when you get to the NEXT sentence, exactly the same thing occurs.I had to give up highlighting various passages within the book, when I realized that I was underlying about 95% of what I was reading.The book is GUARANTEED to shift your viewpoint of reality in a major way.Happy Reading",1
"Not so interesting: This book sounds like it could be filled with wonderful pictures, but the pictures are not of good quality and there aren't many of them. It's the story of a girl and her mother who want to have their home replicated in dollhouse scale. The story is not well written, and the lack of pictures and bad quality of existing pictures don't make up for the badly written text.I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone since there are so many good books already out there with good pictures.",0
"I have finally found authentic Mexican cooking!!: This is a very good book that will teach you how to make delicious Mexican food. Great recipes,I had always been curious how they made refried beans so creamy,OMG now I know it's because of so much lard! I did not give 5 stars, because the tamale section does not go into enough detail.I feel it left out alot of detail that a true beginner tamale maker needs.So,If you're main interest is learning how to make delicious and authentic tamales buy ""Tamales 101 A beginner's guide to making traditional tamales ""by Alice Guadalupe Tapp. That book is 5 stars.",1
"32 flavors...: Alana definitely has some talent, but the fact that she goes and covers an Ani DiFranco song fundamentally without RBR's permission, and then turns it into a teeny bopper hit is a bit argh, shall we say angering. She totally missed the point of the song. save your money and buy Ani's Not a Pretty Girl instead.",0
"Check your make, model, and year before purchase: Metra products work as advertised and are of good quality, but you have to get the right product for your vehicle. In this case, the product is marked for GM vehicles 88 and up. However, I guess there were changes in late model vehicle radios and this product didn't work (in my case a 2009 Chevy Silverado). If you go to Metra's web site and put your make, model, and year in, you will get the right product and then can purchase from Amazon. Guess the packaging for this product hasn't caught up with recent changes in models. Because I was in the middle of a installation yesterday and didn't want to wait on a new product by mail, I was able to get the correct adapter at a local discount auto store.",0
Excellent! - An elevator brings them to another world!: This book was a great book. Its about these two kids who find out there is a thirteenth floor on an old building. When they enter they find themselves fighting pirates and the boy finds himself trying his best to help his sister who has been accused of being a witch! This book always pushed me to turn the page. It is an easy reader but fun to read.,1
Critical piece broke off first use: First time that I used the product the metal piece that goes through the grate and actually lifts the grate broke off. Unfortunately the first time that I used the product was AFTER the date for no-cost return of the product (by two days). It will be cheaper to look for other alternatives than pay for shipping back and forth.Would not have expected such low quality from a Steven Raichlen product.,0
"Natural medicine up against Big Pharma: This book is very well written. It goes into plenty of details about the Hoxsey cancer clinic and it fight with the A.M.A, NCI, ACS, FDA to have the tonic tested and legalised in America. Really a good read.THIS BOOK GETS FIVE STARS I MADE A MISTAKE AND CAN'T REDO WHAT I CLICKED.",0
My son didnt like them: I bought these for my 12m old. He did not play with them. I tried for a month and then I put them away. I took them out when he was 18m. Still wasn't impressed. Not worth it!,0

"One of the best books for girls ever written.: I read this book in one rainy day when I was 9 years old. I ignored all my chores and favorite tv shows because I was unable to put it down, I had never read anything with such a powerful girl character before. She made Nancy Drew look like Barbie. I am now 33,I have read literally thousands of books since and still remember it vividly. My first daughter was born last month and I'm buying a copy for her now so that I know that she'll have one when she's ready for it. I'll probably read it myself a couple times before that.",1
"Terrific!: This book is a fascinating study of the history of rational thought. Dr. Nuland traces the evolution -- the victories and the failures -- of various thinkers in history. He successfully avoids the condescending spirit of the modernist approach to history.It is very informative, and his anecdotes could not be better.This book will definitely appeal to anyone who is interested in the history of science or medicine.I disagree with some of Dr. Nuland's conclusions -- namely, that religion is not a form of superstition and that science will always be intertwined with religion. This, however, does not detract from the fine quality of this work (as other readers may form their own opinions on such matters).",1
Hippie Aunt hated it but kids loved it!: I got two of these as gifts for my cousins aged five and seven and they loved it. They got dozens of gifts for Christmas and this was the first one that they opened to play with. They were shooting at targets on a mirror and having a blast. Easy for kids to use. Just teach them not to shoot at each other and give them targets to shoot!,1
"bait and switch pricing: The price listed is not the price of the unit for sale. This false pricing is a bait and switch that gets you to click on the product, but then you can't buy it for the price listed?",0
boring: Sorry I just could not get into this book. The writing was not worth the time and effort. I couldn't finish it,0
"Dave grew old with the rest of us: Dave was a good old boy back in his time, but time caught up with him and never is it more evident than on this DVD. The jokes are the same ones he has been telling since the 1950's and 60's. A few come off nicely, but a better amount fall flat mostly because of the passing of time. I think seeing it live would have made a great difference in perspective.",0
Insightful discussions for working mothers: If you like name dropping politics and social commentary and you are a working mother or love one-- then I highly recommend this book. It's full of insight and understanding about the difficulties and triumphs of working mothers.Cokie Roberts was born into a legendary political family and has become an outstanding journalist through hard work and a lot of support from others. She dedicates the book to those who have provided the support.It was a fun and inspiring book.,1
A Great and Fun Read!: I love Billie's style of characters. She paints a very vivid picture of the characters. I couldn't wait to go back and read the previous Billie Letts book. I am anxiously anticipating the next book.,1
"A bit flimsy, a little squeeky..: Even when this thing is bolted tight onto the drywall, it is a little bit flimsy where the bar is that sticks out over the paper towel. It wiggles and squeaks when you're trying to pull out paper towels. It feels cheaply made. Worked hard to perfect my bathroom and I don't think this was the right finishing touch for it. I bought it mainly for its looks and smaller size compared to the higher rated Perfect Tear Chrome Paper Towel Holder.",0
"More Devotional than Biographical: This biography of"" St. Francis of Assisi"" is written in a simple, hagiographic style which presents the events of St. Francis' life as a series of incidents which contribute to the legend of this ever popular saint.All the events which are familiar to a follower of St. Francis are here, the abandonment of his heritage, the rejection by his family, the following of the brothers and St. Clare and her followers, the stigmata and illness leading to his death. The author makes clear St. Francis' personal humility and self deprecation.I found this book to be more devotional than biographical. The reader should look here for the basic facts of St. Francis' life and the awe in which he was held by his followers. If you approach it in that vein you will be very satisfied. One seeking a real biography would be better advised to look elsewhere.",1
"I should have said ""Getting to know Benjamin Nugent"": I've realized I was wrong with my review I wrote previously on this guy's book, giving him a 5 of 5 stars. Not because I don't like the book, but because Nugent truly is a poor writer. I still enjoy the book because I do learn things from it and I do realize what Nugent tries to say in some parts (which is why I talked about hidden meanings), but that is what a good writer is supposed to do; they're supposed to show their reader exactly what they are trying to say, not hint to it. I still respect what Nugent tried to do, and I'm sure I'll read the book again, but it is poorly written. In my last review I gave him 5 stars because I was mainly reviewing him; I liked the effort he went through to complete the book. But I was only reviewing the person and not the actual book! Sorry to mess with everyone's heads!",0
"Low speed is way to fast, pooly designed beaters: This is a heavy and powerful mixer. Power is great, but power and rotational speed are different things. There is no reason for the lowest speed to be so high that it flings ingredients out of the bowl. They need to gear it down so that it doesn't spin so fast or change the motor design. The beaters are very poorly designed for mixing ingredients. I've used Kitchenaid and even cheap (less than $10) mixers that would beat lumps of brown sugar in a batter better than this one. These beaters manage to shoot the lumps right through, over and over again. I use a spoon to mash the soft lumps and continue. I could sift everything of course, but shouldn't have to.",0
"Skarpetta is aging, but getting more interesting: If one can overlook some loose ends and a very poignant plot twist, this is actually one of Cornwells better novels of late. It certainly is better than Cause of Death or Hornet's Nest. A novel with Kay Scarpetta may be a bit predictable, but it's like sitting down with an old friend. I'd recommend it.",1
Two thumbs up!: Another great product from Ginger Plowman. This is quite a handy reference for those times when you need help asking the right questions.,1
"Ivitiation to Europe: This video was well done - a nice sample of several countries and roads. The scenery was beautiful and the music chosen well - although I might have added a bit of yodelling to the alps, and a Tarentella to Italy. I have already made room in my daypack for a baquette, cheese and some wine!!",1
Most over-rated movie of all time!: This movie for some reason always ends up on the best 100 list. Why? I have no idea. Every character comes across as being caricatures. Difficult to treat this movie seriously.,0
"Great and Mighty: I believe the title sums it all up. Loved 'Great and Mighty', best track on there by far, followed by 'Celebrate'.",1
"Poor design: Shoe horn is connected to the handle with a spring. The spring has stayed well connected to the handle, but it HASN'T stayed connected to the shoe horn. They need to forget the spring and have a solid connection wedding the shoe horn and handle together.",0
"Catfish: The trailers and advertisements for this movie made it seem like it's a thriller movie, which it's totally not. It's a very boring, over rated movie. I personally couldn't stand the main character at all, he was annoying and didn't seem real. I wouldn't recommended this movie. It might have actually been a cool movie if the person at the end was a serial killer, like the ads for this movie made it seem like, but like I said, it's nothing like you think and is very boring. The movie is about meeting a person online who has false identities and IS NOT A KILLER. So if that sounds interesting to you, than go ahead and watch this boring movie. I was very upset at this movie because of the false advertisements.",0
"A great story poorly written.: Ms. Sirota Gordon has a facinating tale to tell but, ultimately, its telling has little depth and skims the surface of events in her life. Her story deserves another author.",0
Not such a good cup of coffee: Ok loved this coffee maker at first. But then it stared leaking a bit. So after a few months of that and learning just to put the maker by the sink. Now it has died on me and the pump went out. I only had this maker for 6 months. Gee my last one that still works and I gave away was over 15 yrs old. I should of kept it. Now I am out $50 and I need a new maker.,0
"I stumbled into this music and stayed for the whole show.: I first heard Judee Sill on a compilation disc, ""Troubadours of Folk"" Vol. 4 Singers and Songwriters. Wow, what a voice! After listening to that cut over and over, I knew I had to track down anything else I could find by Judee Sill. While I am not an ardent fan of ""Jesus Freak"" lyrics, I would listen to this voice singing a train schedule. Get this album! Ignore some of the words and be transported by an angel's voice.",1

"terrible, terrible product: This thing is horrible and doesn't work for anything. It won't heat up wires 1/16 diameter, and smaller wires loose thier heat before you can touch the solder to it. It won't even melt solder directly.The white LED light turns off once it makes a connection with your work, so don't think it's going to be a good working light!Waste of money",0
"Universal, please fix your blu rays!: We just got this, and my daughter was all excited to watch it, but the darn thing can't load. Oh, and how do I know it's Universal that did this to me? Because all we've seen on our screen for the past 10 minutes is little spinning globe universal logo. And the worst part is, Universal has done this to me before. We have the same problem with our Despicable Me blu ray, again with the spinning logo.These are the only two blu rays we've ever had a problem with. We keep our blu ray player updated, and we have movies from several different studios, but the Universal ones are the only ones that don't seem to work. I don't know if they're just loading it down with ""bonus"" junk or what, but it's not working, so please stop and just let us enjoy the darn movie.",0
"Modestly interesting and even less useful: Having just turned 25 and needing some advice on what the hell to do about it, I picked up this cleverly-titled paperback. Long before the end, though, I realized Quarterlife Crisis coasts by more on its inherently interesting subject matter than anything the authors have to say about it. Throughout all 198 pages it has this anecdotal, unstructured, almost gossipy feel. A recurring theme is for the authors to make a point (usually an obvious one), then spend the next 20 pages circumventing the subject instead of expanding or analyzing, much less providing a solution. There are pockets of insight here and there, but most of the comfort of reading this book ended where it started: knowing my concerns affected others.Consider this a book written for ditzes, by ditzes. Anyone with brains or ambitions in life would need a stronger dose of logic and insight to be satisfied.",0
"I was generally pleased with the book.: This book, while promising to have every stat imaginable, left out the one statistic I was looking for. Blown Saves. I have not found one single publication that listed individual blown saves statistics. So mr. James, if you ever get wind if this, please, put blown saves statistics into one of your books. Thank you. PS (Every other aspect of the book was flawless)",1
"China Run by David Ball: If China Run was not ever on the New York Times Bestseller list, It should have been! It was an excellent book!",1
"Pretty decent vampire movie: I don't know why everybody complains about Tom Cruise's performance in this movie. I think he actually carries the movie. His portrayal of LeStat may not be strictly by-the-book (I don't know ; I haven't read it), but is very convincing. Kisten Dunst plays an excellent part. I have to say this is by far the best vampire movie ever made. For once you can actually suspend your disbelief and enjoy the world of these nocturnal creatures.",1
Don't even bother!!!: I bought this TV on December 13th. 3 months and 1 week later it crapped out on me. I saw that the exact same thing happened to 4 other people THIS MONTH!! Don't buy this TV!!,0
"Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize = 5 STARS! Metalblade = 0 STARS! where's the DVD?: i'm really sick of getting cheated out of bonus discs and bonus dvds by the U.S. releases. Metalblade US sent out a notice that they will no longer promote their European releases in the US by sending out promotional copies for review/internet radio, etc. they would only concentrate on 'un-Metal' (which is my wordplay for Nu-Metal/Mall-core) on the US counterpart of Metalblade. little did i expect that also meant not releasing CD's with the added bonuses that Metalblade in Europe released. Vomitory ""Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize was released with a bonus DVD of alive show from La Laiterie, Strasbourg 04/04/03. this isn't the only release the US label cheats us American supporters, and unfortunately, it won't be the last.",0
"Do not buy the kindle version: I do not know why they offer this in Kindle edition. It is USESLESS. Complete waste of money, especially for the price. Do not buy!",0
"Poor cousin to ""Homicide"": From the moment I picked up this book, it felt like a west coast rip-off of David Simon's ""Homicide"" book about Baltimore Homicide detectives. The book itself is not very well written and is full of typos. The detectives aren't very likeable, either. I feel like I've learned more by watching a real-life cop show on A&E than I did by reading this book. Do yourself a favor...stick with the best and the original: David Simon's book.",0
love nine west!: i have a true size 12 foot and i normally buy my shoes from Payless shoe store..but i started trying the ninewest shoes and they are great. i am 6ft tall..plus size..i tend not to gain weight in my feet so i really dont have problems with width or going up a shoe size..this pump is beautiful...it looks exactly as its pictured...but if you have a wide foot..i would not recomment it at all. i have a normal width foot and so i dont have a problem with it..but it fits just right...,1
"The pity of this book: This book meanders all over the place, from some history and literary critique to economics. Ferguson indulges in long tracts with endless figures to reach highly doubtful conclusions. Mostly, he likes to shoot down other people's theories with a mass of facts and figures, yet his own conclusions are based on extremely sketchy evidence. Some examples of his conclusions: the Kaiser was not responsible for leading Germany into war and the war went on because men weren't tired of fighting. I think I can pretty much guarantee that given a choice, 99.99% would've voted to go home.",0
"Unbelievably boring ... don't waste your time: Ms. Rice creates such a beautiful story of Marius in ""Lestat, the Vampire"".To pair him with the one dimensional character of Pandora is a insult.This book starts out well and then dumps into the stupid.",0
"Very Good: I actually enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. It's a quick read, but it's fun, and the characters are cute and likeable. It seems to be marketed to the 10-15 age range (lack of suggestive or mature themes), but I'm 24 and liked it, so I would recommend it to any age.As a side note - the cover is absolutely gorgeous.",1
"great book---review of the fodorian worldview: This is a great opportunity to catch up on the way Fodor figures things work. He provides a simplified, only sometimes-snarky, review of his key committments, as previously laid out in a daunting series of brief and difficult books.What's more, it's a chance to see where the hard problems are, and why Pinker et al. are a bit drunk on recent gains.",1
Don't buy video quality is just useless!: bad product i should resell this thing. The quality of the video is horrible and has no low light abilities very records very little time but does help that it has moving sensor. I purchased a spy pen that works 10x better quality video and audio but with out moving sensor which i wish it had. Any ways don't buy this it useless.,0
"Don't waste you money: This monitor is worthless, basically it doesn't work! It constantly beeps signalling 'out of range' even when it's only a few feet away. On top of that it also makes a loud clicking sound, so if you want to get any sleep don't buy this monitor. Even if it was $5 it would be a waste of money. If I could I would give it negative 5 stars-it's a complete joke!!",0
"Works with older Sony cameras: I bought this for an older Sony camera that I use for business travel. The camera will accept DUO but not PRO DUO Memory Sticks. Since this item was advertised as being for a Sony game system (PSP, I think), I wasn't 100% sure it would work. As an FYI, there is a great cross reference guide for cameras on the support section of Sony's website. As it turns out, this item works perfectly and I'm very happy with it.",1
"A term paper on an event in Soviet naval history: I heard that this book was an account of a true story about a mutiny in the Soviet navy that became the basis for Tom Clancy's first hit ""The Hunt for Red October."" Technically this is true. However, be warned that the number of pages devoted to appendicies and footnotes exceeds the number devoted to the mutiny. This is an academic biography of the political officer mutineer -- his history, his beliefs, something of the mutiny, and the political response that is as documented as it is boring. If you are looking for this type of information, the auther did a good job --it probably rates 4 stars. However, if you are looking for a sea story, you've been warned.",0
"exelent book !: This is book that covers areas of c++ , which are usualy not covered in common c++ books. Templates are fastest growing part of c++ language , which leads developing new libraries ( as boost , etc ... ) , and which impacts improving other programming languages with their collections libraries and alike. This book shows many different usages of templates , and it's for me very afirmative with good ideas and guidelines.",1
"how did I ever live w/o Amazon: currently have a propane firepit that only uses a 20lb propane tank. Problem is the propane tank is bigger than the firepit and is quite the eyesore. went to ace, osh, and home depot to find a reverse propane tank adapter(20lb to 1lb); I could only find the adapter I needed on Amazon. With this item attached to your hose/unit you can use the small 1lb propane tanks and the small coleman tanks will fit. Like the other reviews have said there is no regulator so make sure you have all connections attached and ready to light. It is somewhat expensive for such a small piece of metal but it's worth it.",1
"anamorphic DVD or BluRay please!!!!: I agree with the posting that states: ""Love the movie, hate the DVD."" The currently available DVD transfer is horrible, shameful. A movie as good as this should at least be available on anamorphic DVD or better yet, BluRay. Because the current DVD is not anamorphic, it does not play properly on today's widescreen, HDTV's. The film does not properly fit today's HDTV widescreen and the picture quality is no better than a VHS tape, in fact, it's worse than VHS tape.",0
"Can two stubborn souls find true love?: When Jamie Thompson overheard her fianc√© telling his best man how he'd fooled her into marrying him and that he planned to persuade her to sell her business so that his casino could be built, Jamie decided to forego saying ""I do"" and fled the church. She jumped into the waiting limousine and was greeted by a pair of steel blue eyes in the rearview mirror. Those eyes belonged to Cord Mason, owner of the limousine service. After he helps her escape, he finds himself drawn to Jamie despite their being at odds with each other. He's alarmed by her profession as a racecar driver. And her opposition to the casino puzzles him. Can't she see the economic boon it would be to the community? To his failing limousine service? But Jamie won't sell her business because it's more than just a building; it's her family heritage. She vows to protect both it and the well being of her community as she and Cord travel a very rocky road to love and understanding.",1

Why such a low rating?: This movie is more than enjoyable and I am glad I didn't pay attention to the low rating. The movie is not just a little funny but extremely funny. My favorite part: the recording of the message on the answering machine. :D But just watch it and enjoy! WORTH every minute.,1

"unlikable heroin: I've really enjoyed several books of this type lately. Patricia Briggs especially tells a great story. Because of them, I decided to give Working for the Devil a read.The main character, Dante is a real very hard to like. She lives in the future where things seem to be vastly different. The author tells the story in a confusing way. She seems to bring in new ideas as they come into her head. Her writing in not very engaging and I had a hard time coming back to the story after setting the book down.I don't recommend this book or this author.",0
"FLAT OUT BAD: Doesn't anyone else hear it? The man is FLAT!... both musically and emotionally...and painfully so. Tom Postilio even manages to strip the heart out of the beautifully sad ""We Live on Borrowed Time"". I can't believe people praise him and compare him to Sinatra. If you're looking for a cabaret singer in the style and voice of Sinatra, try Charles Cermele",0
"I'm a history buff, so I hated this movie: The popularity of this movie continues to astound me. As much as I dislike Kevin Costner, his ""Wyatt Earp"", while still not perfect, is altogether a more historically accurate portrayal of the real events depicted in the film. There are just some films that take themselves so seriously while totally mangling any chance of believability, they leave me alternating between laughing out loud and wanting to throw things through the screen. This is one, ""Armageddon"" is another.OTOH, if you liked westerns in the 50's where nothing was even remotely realistic, this might be your cup of tea. All style, no substance...",0

"Little Box Comes with Big Satisfaction: Recently received a new computer as a gift. My high-tech son (young generation) did not order a floppy drive for my new computer. I quickly hit the panic button on how was I going to retrieve and store data from my older computer. He advised me to order an external floppy drive recommeding one from iomega. Following his advice, I ordered the iomega 32663 USB floppy drive. Once received, out of the box, plugged it into the USB port and was done within 3 minutes. I've been happily transferring and storing data ever since. This product is sleek/compact looking and sits right on top of my desk. There were many other drives that I reviewed that were less expensive, but the price matched the dependability of the iomega brand.",1
"A Real NY Story: Anti-Hero is an easy read that really captures the struggles of the average person trying to make it in the jungle that is New York City. The protagonist of the story is a guy named Billy D., who's an actor/brawler/construction worker/passionate guy. We follow him through the guts of the city in his search for life, liberty and happiness ON HIS TERMS! You'll either love the guy or hate him. This book is for anyone who has a dream and wants to make it happen. Anti-Hero will inspire you, make you laugh, make you angry and maybe even change your view of the world. I highly recommend this book!",1
"excellent starter child's magic kit: I purchased this for my 9 year old grandson who is interested in magic. he studied the illusions hard and put on a show for the family in about a week. Good tricks but impressive enough to entertain, simple enough to learn.",1

"Very disappointing: I am very disappointed with this software. All the negative things that people have said about it are true. I have used it for a few (wasted) hours, and this is what I've found:---It is very difficult to navigate the software. It is not intuitive. I am an experienced computer user, I've even used Fritz before, but I could not figure out this software.---It is very cumbersome to set it up to review a game you've played, which is what I mostly wanted to do.---This software is not just difficult, it is BUGGY! There are many functions in the program for which there is no ""Help"" at all! I tried the openings trainer, and the openings are all named in a foreign language! (Polish?) There is an option to delete games from the database, but it doesn't work! And so on.My advice: don't buy this software. You can analyze your games with a good engine (Fritz 6) and small database (12,000 games) using the free program ""Chessbase Light"". I recommend it.",0

"Gunbird is a RENTER ONLY PEOPLE: Look I love my old school sprite shooters but this game gets old really really quick. I promise you will thank me about this. It IS however a good rental game. I bought it, I couldnt help myself, before playing this. I hade all of 10 minutes of fun then the games was over! It is soooo short that the only life we get outta of the game now is multiplayer and even that is old. Look if I were you I would wait for a game called GigaWing 2 which is scheduled for release this year. It is 10x better than the original and features high resolution sprites instead of the ... CS2 we get here or on GigaWing 1.",0
"Definately based on movies.: We bought this and LOVE it. We knew it was based on the movies and we were fine with that. Although we read the books long before the movies were being made! The games pieces are made of pewter and you would need to expect to be gentle with them. The swords will bend if used as action figures. (we have not done this) but I can imagine little ones getting a hold of them and doing so.Granted the movie making category has rather hard questions, but if you have watched the bonus and extra DVDS, the information is in there. I am a 42 yr old mother and have played this with my oldest son, 20, middle son 15 and his friend and we had all had fun with it. If you are looking for a grand Tolkien experience, this game is not for you.",1

"FORD ONLY!: While the description states it works for 1994 and newer Chrysler/Jeep vehicles...it does not. I tried it on my 98 Grand Cherokee, a friends 2007 Sebring, and a 2008 300. The coupling tool didn't work for any of them. While I did not try it on any 1981+ Fords, I'd have to assume it'd work for them since that's the only other vehicle listed.Aside from them not working for my application, overall the product quality is not the best. Remember, it's plastic. Anyone who has done work with spring couplings will know that these won't last. If you're getting them for a one time fix (why I got these), they're good enough and cheap. Anything more than that, go with a better quality tool.",0
"PATHETIC: After the first 2 minutes of viewing I wanted my money back. There is not a single track of music unspoiled by boring commentary. Doesn't even include the title track. Unfortunately, I didn't read others reviews until it was too late. A total waste of shelf space.",0
"Disappointed: I bought this book because I was intrigued by the title, but I was very disappointed in the contents. The author has obviously done her research, but I sure wish she could have presented it better. I found parts of it very repetitive (where was the editor?). I found many of the ""connections"" to be very very speculative at best. (When someone takes words from one language, reverses the letters, and points to the similarity to a word in another language, I get very nervous.) All in all, the best part of the book was the introduction by Sweeney. Nevertheless, I still find the subject interesting enough to pursue, and intend to read some of the sources that the author points to.",0
"Convenient and Tasty: Convenient package and tasty meal.Unfortunately, Kraft has discontinued this product.I used to eat this stuff as a kid, then could not get it for about 25 years, then found it via the internet about 3 years ago.

"Not Roger and Me, but close.: Here we go again with more brilliance from Michael Moore. This time he's a little short on irony but makes up for it with some really funny stuff. He just doesn't have someone as shameless as Roger as a foil.My guess is, folks who don't like this are a bit uncomfortable with making fun of great Americans like Steve Forbes. Or maybe they suspect that the minimum wage really isn't enough to get by on. Thinking about stuff like that can get pretty upsetting.",1

"Are they kidding?: I read ""The Talisman"" for two reasons: first, because I'm a fan of Peter Straub, and second, I'd heard the book described as the equal of Tolkien's trilogy. Was I ever disappointed!!!!!I can hardly believe the reviewers who liked ""The Talisman"" are really serious--or that they're older than, oh, twelve. There is NO comparison whatsoever between the works of the master, J.R.R. Tolkien and the Straub-King collaboration. The latter is a book for children, period--and I believe you shouldn't bother reading it if you're over the age of fifteen. I'm 52, by the way, and I first read ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" over 30 years ago--and I think the movies pale beside the books, too.",0
DK Does It Right: I've always admired the books published by DK. This one is very cool. I think the big attraction with books such as this are the images. Great reference book to have if you are studying the human body or are into the science of nutrition.,1
"Cute but painful: Ugh. I was so excited to get these shoes, but they kill my feet! The band across the top is too tight, and the heels are too loose and rigid. Thre is a definite sizing problem.

Good read: This was a very enjoyable read and a great start for the series. It is erotica and therefore graphic but if you love erotica you will enjoy this book.,1
"Reise, Reise: Reise, Reise is a great album to listen to, if you are eclectic. This album contains many different sounds, like snare drums in Reise Reise and Mein Teil, accordians in Reise, Reise and Moskau, lots of synthesizing in most of the songs, like Reise, Reise, Keine Lust, and Amour, for example. The album is also wonderful as Till can sing in not only German, but English. He even sings with the Russian girl (Viktoria, I believe) and says ??? ??? ???, which is amazing. And amour is French, so a total of four languages are sung. The bilingual songs, like Amerika and Moskau are among my favourites, as I am learning to become a translator. Rammstein has, since I learned about them in 2001, helped me with linguistics. Oh, and Olli sings, too. Great Album, Vielen Dank, Rammstein. Ich hore immer ihre Musik zu!",1
"The Best Horror Movie I Have Ever Seen: This is the best movie i have seen in years, and the sensation of realism will take you over your skin and make you wonder if something like that will ever hapend to you or if already hav hapened. It will be a long time to see another movie like this.",1
"A great childrens History book: I bought this book for my Grandson, he is 8, loves to read and like all great kids has some very detailed questions he would like answered,There is a entire series of these ""Eye Witness"" books.They are great.He had his questions answered about what cannons and swords are like, and yes he understands now people die and he also understands what a Patriot is and that sometimes a mans duty is to protect his family and Country at all costs.But it's not a bloody gory book, It's reality and done very well,It's about 80 pages, He read it in 2 days tops and remembered everything in the book,Check this series out, I was and am very impressed with them.They have books on many topics of wars and conflicts we have been in as a Country. A outstanding reality History book for a change that speaks the truth in the details a 8 year old is satisfied with.",1
"Good Resource: Found very helpful when my doctor suggested I cut out refined sugars, vinegars and simple carbohydrates in order to help recover from a yeast allergy. While I have not stayed as strict as The Yeast Connection diet suggests, it really helped the first month I needed to cut back.",1
Mr. Magoos Christmas Carol: I bought this as a gift for my mother who has loved this movie since she was a girl. We watched it and we were both impressed with the quality of this movie.,1
"Amazing, but way too long!: The whole series of ""Power!"" is fantastic, but if you are not a person with lots of patience and basic music theory, technically and theoretically, this book will keep the whole Ableton thing above your head. Otherwise, this is all you will need to master Ableton...",1
"Brilliant poem, horrible translation: The Duino Elegies is one of the most breathtaking turns of 20th-century poetry (I don't want to say ""great"" or ""canonical"" here) but it has suffered a long history of bad translations into English that push the agendas of translators over faithfulness to the text. You're better off finding an early translation than picking this up, at least until a (good) poet takes the project on--Jerome Rothenberg, where are you when we need you?",0
"I got what I expected, and honestly enjoyed it.: Chulip, from its pictures alone, is obviously a game with bad graphics. However, I'm not one to judge a game on its graphics alone. I liked the idea of a 'kissing RPG', and wanted to try it out!Voices: My god, what in the hell are they saying? They didn't bother re-dubbing voices. They repeat the same lines over and over, which won't make sense to you at all, while text appears on the bottom of the screen. This was a small annoyance that I quickly got used to.What I loved was the challenge of gaining all those kisses. For everyone's information: ALL available kisses in the game are listed in the manual that come WITH the game, and even explains how to gain them. There's no need to buy or look up a guide.I felt a sense of triumph when I gained all kisses! It wasn't easy, and I did have a LOT of fun. This game is cheap used, and I highly recommended it for someone looking for an inexpensive challenge.",1
"KitchenAid KFP750 lives up to its reputation!: I spent alot of time looking at food processor reviews. Cooks Illustrated gave the KitchenAid KFP750 the top rating. I bought it and found that I love everything about this food processor! It is powerful, simple to use and extremely QUIET!",1
"Fanciful light reading =): This book is a great one for quick, fun reading. Gaiman's style here comes almost as very fairy-tale-esque, and at times this almost reads like a children's story (though Gaiman is quick to remind us that it is not). The writing in this story is very simple and straight-forward... Gaiman doesn't use a whole lot of flowery language, so this book isn't difficult to read in the slightest (but the plot of the story is enough to keep advanced readers interested as well).It's accessible enough to be enjoyable to teenagers and adults alike. I wouldn't recommend it for children younger than about 13 because there are brief instances of cursing and some suggestive content (nothing explicit, but still). But for anyone of teenage years and above it is a delightful and imaginative read. It was the first book by Neil Gaiman that I've had the pleasure of reading and I definitely look forward to experiencing more of his work.",1
"Barron's AP World Hisotry: This was the worst review book I have ever used. This was the one that my teacher's recommended, but it was a complete waste of money. I have used Kaplan, REA, Five Steps to a Five, and Cliffs, and this book just did not compare. Unless you want a paperback version of a textbook, this is not the book for you. The only upside was the practice multiple choice; however, it is not worth the money otherwise, so try something else if you want a book that makes it easy to review the subject material.",0
Putrid Filmmaking...: Travolta should be ashamed of himself for this one. Just go watch Pulp Fiction again. The director of this movie should never be allowed to work again.,0
"this album shows the amazing versatility and talent of Garth: This album demonstrates the amazing verstitly and talent of Garth Brooks. The vocals and music are fantastic and span various music styles from60's to 90's all good. It is one of the few albums I've owned in which I enjoyed all the songs. Several Snow In July, The Way Of the girl, and Lost in you (which Garth sings in falseta) are fabulous.",1
"I can't believe how good I felt after doing this video!: I am 26 weeks pregnant and just started doing this video. It is wonderful! I was starting to get uncomfortable and the stretching and strength exercises made me feel like I have more room for my baby.I was really tired and a little shaky when I finished the first time, but then within a couple of hours I got a huge energy surge.The other reviews complained of the scenery and not enough explanation - that's the beauty of working out at home you can pause and rewind! I spend most of my time looking away from the TV because she tells you the next move before you have finished the current one so you can be ready for the change.My posture and breathing improves dramatically for hours after doing this video. My only suggestion is to not do the workout too late in the day, because the energy surge makes it hard to go to sleep. :)I have recommended this to many women. I love it!",1
"Lacking subtitles...: Beware if you do not speak Mandarin...Although this serial was released by Image Entertainment, in the set that I received, the English subtitles are present only up to the third disc . The last three discs do not have any subtitles whatsoever... The pacing is also very slow; and the plot is drawn out and confusing.",0
"Totally Predictable and Silly: my title says it all....I also, had this one figured out immediately and it killed all suspense, as it was so painfully obvious....I wrote this to answer the question one person asked about what happened to Jennifer? What happened to her is the same malady that has afflicted and ruined many a hollywood starlet in the last 10 years....ANOREXIA.......it does more than ruin your shape and body, it destroys your face.....go watch one of her older movies, as an example, look at her in ""Picture Perfect"" and then look at her arms, and body and sorrowful face now, as in this movie.....it is a crying shame....but she has plenty of company here....I could go on all night comprising a list of these people.....",0
"Must have: This book should be in every cupboard, unless your not interested in what the world looks like, described with all the highlights in just a few pages. Good for first idea travel preparations too. This is a book that everyone picks up if you put it on the table. And of course - great photos!",1
BUYER BEWARE!!!: I ordered a 3 inch potted plant and the item I received was pieces of the plant I ordered in rough shape(one piece is actually dead the other two are hanging on for life) and packaged very poorly.There is no pot for the plant or soil and no directions on how to care for the plant.,0
"Not for those interested in the speeches.: Listen to some of the best written, most artfully delivered, and important speeches in our nation's history overlayed with a cheesy, soporific elevator-music score. Sorry I spent money on it.",0
"Stay Away from this!: This is a total waste of money. As already indicated it works on only about 50% of the websites. And even after adding a website you will continue receiving messages regarding ""do you want to add this site to I.D. Vault"". I was told to uninstall it and install it again. There was no improvement. And here is the kicker someone stole my identity while I was using I.D. Vault on the internet. But when contacted regarding the problem I was told it is not clear that it was a failure of the Vault. It might simply be one of the sites that was not able to interface properly. I think the developer might have purposely made it so it would not interface with 50% of the sites so this could always be used as a convenient excuse when it fails. Like I said a total waste. The only good thing is that is does is fill out your basic information such as your address and shipping address.",0
Great creaper for the price!: My husband has been looking for 2 years now for a creeper with a back on it at a reasonable price. We finally came across this one and I ordered it for his Father's Day gift. It is exactly what he wanted at a price that was very affordable.,1
Useless in case of emergency: I purchased the product hoping to diagnose & hopefully fix a hard drive that had essentially crashed.The emergency disk that came with the program turned out to be useless -- no better than Microsoft's ScanDisk program.What worked? Downloading the diagnostic program made specifically for my hard drive by its manufacturer (Maxtor).I can't speak to the other utilities in the suite as I will be returning the program.,0
"Scrawny Withered, Feeble, Sickly Plant Nub: Granted it is a cold winter and challenging to ship a live plant,the posted reviews about the quality of shipping procedures andmature plants encouraged my purchase.Really, the plant wasn't packaged well - just a matter ofmoving inventory and recording sales. A sad plant in a plasticbag, with an old chemical hand warmer included more for appearancethan effectiveness (they last for hours not days) stuffed into a boxwith angel turds.The plant wasn't quite d.o.a. but more like in the throws ofcardiac arrest.Save your money, buy seeds and germination materials instead.",0
"In a class of its own: I've read numerous bodybuilding books and magazines, and nothing has compared to this book. If you are interested in excercise from a no-hype perspective, without steroids or other pharmaceuticals and you want to build a strong, healthy physique, give this book a try.",1
"Knives don't cut it: I wish it was possible to give less than 1 star! Went through dishwasher once, came out rust! Save your money....or your packaging! I thought Chicago cutlery; how can I go wrong? so out the packaging went! I called Chicago Cutlery. Turns out some of their stuff is now made in China. Wouldn't that make it China Cutlery?",0
"Disappointed: I purchased this product based on a CNET recommendation. CNET has been a reliable source for most of my technology purchases. This however, was a disappointment. The unit does not eliminate sound effectively, volume controls are ""mushy,"" the microphone/on off switch will not stay retracted, resulting in a constantly discharging battery. It did pair easily, and the voice activated controls worked well. I would not purchase another, and would advise others to avoid this model.",0

motorola v710/e815: The product does not work. the charger does not charge my e815 and the leather strap popped within 2 days. the ear piece does not pick up well. will send back if i find time. found a better product that works for less on ebay,0
"solid game, sweet controls: Game better than I expected, the wii remote as steering wheel is amazing. Don't rely on the reviews that panned it--the default controls make the game arguably more fun than burnout 4.It's pretty straightforward--turn the remote left to go left and right to go right. If you're a flailing maniac and you don't have the coordination to handle the remote like a steering wheel then you may want to try another game.The only use for the alternate control schemes is on the drift tracks, otherwise stick with the default control until you get it. Have patience (yeah, right).Very solid racing game for Wii. Would have gotten a 5/5 but I want to see what else the Wii has in store, plus no online. 4/5",1
"It is a Real Effort to read Rafael Lefort: This book claims finding Gurdjieff's teaching in the Walled Garden of Truth. This is not based on a serious study of Gurdjieff, but on something else. However, the book has value as entertainment and can be read as a substitute for the Mullah Nasr Eddin stories, although it lacks much of the humour.Many claims have been made to the origins of Gurdjieff's teaching and traces of it can be also found in many, also in Sufism.The book came out in 1966 and one could suspect that the 'teachers of Gurdjieff' had already died by 1966 (before he died himself in 1949). Unless... the writer had some means of communicating with the dead, which indeed could be a 'Real Effort'....",0
"Body Opus is a real-results diet book: To steal a phrase from Dan Duchaine, this book details how an average person can transform their diet and become extraordinary. The results are really amazing.

Both men and women will benefit from Body Opus. A definite must for all people who want to go beyond ""normal"".",1

"Say No to the Night Shift: I went in so excited for this show, that was supposed to revolve around my favorite daytime couple, Patrick Drake and Robin Scropio, but was instantly dissappointed. It depicted them as totally different character and the story change half way through was a disasterious idea. The forced pairing of ""nurse"" Leyla and Patrick was nausiating and lacking in any chemistry. It was so horrible i stopped watching after acouple episodes.",0

"You'd think for the $ they'd test it: This watch is very disappointing. It runs about 5 to 6 minutes fast a week. Very annoying. I see from another review mine is not an isolated case. Seiko said I'd have to pay shipping and it would take up to 6 weeks turn around on the repairs. Poor customer service for a brand new watch, what a rip off.",0
Great Cd / Great Price / Great Service: If your an Eagles fan then you know this is obviously a great CD. But the price and servcie was unbeatable and it arrived in a few days.,1
"Lame sequel: They took a good story and made it a low budget follow up. I mean, a chase scene in broken carts? Not without it's moments, but there's a reason Pixar is consistently better!",0
Another book with no code: This book like another book that I previously reviewed and have already returned has no significant code samples. It is however filled with descriptions of methods and properties - which I can look up on line.There is no reason to buy this book I am afraid.,0
"Faith in McCrone: McCroneianity: Science, properly understood, means proving a hyphothesis and having that proof replicated by one's peers. This was not done with McCrone's ""proof"" obtained only by McCrone using his ""instruments"".

"Keep looking: My unit began to freeze up after a couple of weeks. Since this only happened on rented DVD's at first, I decided to keep it. Well, after 3 months of light use, the unit began to freeze up on all DVD's, new or used. Eventually, within 4 months, it would not even read any DVD or CD.I called RCA to get it repaired under warranty (no toll-free number), and the ONLY option that was offered was to replace the unit at a cost of $89.95. I did this and the new unit works ok so far, but it is noisy when reading disks.If you do some research on the net, you'll notice that many others have experienced similar problems. In short, this is an unreliable unit that is not backed very well by the manufacturer.",0
"WOW! No more highchair Clean-up!!!!: I had 3 highchairs for my triplets and hated every minute of clean-up. Also when they were old enough to walk, the chairs became a dangerous climbing gym. With my 4th baby, I discovered this feeding seat and I am soooo happy and so is baby! She gets to sit at the table with everyone else. The seat reclines for infant's first feedings, and grows with baby. Space Saver, very easy to clean, fairly sturdy, reasonable price. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! The Little laminated ABC mat that fits on the tray is abit useless and flimsy, but that's a minor thing.",1
Great Look Back at WW II Entertainers: This media is more comprehensive than others I have seen and really enjoyed it. I really liked looking at the old stars.Worth the price and viewing.,1
"Misleading label: The description of the product is ""Dax 100% Pure Lanolin Super Conditioner 14 oz. The product however, contains well less than 50% lanolin. The product is not bad, for what it is made of, but it is grossly misadvertised and the label itself is very misleading (you have to read the fine print about the ""100% Pure LANOLIN,"" where it says, ""compounded with."" I was looking for real pure lanolin.",0
"What is it about, really?: Well, yes... the book is about an inventive boy and a search and all that. The other reviewers are right in superficial way. The book is really about this; that loving is painful, but that not loving is much more painful. This book is about love, which is not really surprising. Safran Fore's librarian in his last novel, Everything is Illuminated, remarked ""But all the books are about love.""This one certainly is.",1
"Over-sweetened now, like all the other dried mangoes.: I used to rave about these Philippine Brand Dried Mangoes, they tasted so amazing, so unlike all the other over-sugared brands.However, my last order was 10 times better than this last one.

"Best retort to critics for anyone's life: There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us.",1
Be careful- Not what the picture saids it is: reading the description- I thought it was the floor railing that I was buying. Shows pictures of people using rail and describes how people use this rail. It turns out it's just a 68.95 floor plate. No rail included. What a crooked way to do business.,0
"GARBAGE: First off Creed is garbage. Their music is garbage and his lyrics are garbage. You want some real lyrics, listen to some EMO-CORE. This is a perfect cd for hanging out at the monster truck rally and comparing the utter coolness of your MULLET cut. Great music for small town heroes with tight rolled jeans and camaros. Get a clue. Creed is junk.",0

"I declare you Triple H and Book Lover!: Hi Book Lover, are you in love with Triple H or something, you must be because nobody else apart from Triple H, his wife and you think his the greatest wrestler around today. The guy can't wrestler to save his life that is unless you believe wrestling about two muscle bound apes hitting each other very slowly for twenty minutes, because that's all Triple H does. His one of the worst wrestlers in history. He is the only one to blame for the state the WWE is in today. His nothing more than a gimmick wrestler, can anybody remember a decent Triple H match that wasn't a gimmick match? Didn't think so! He did have one decent match, that was against the Ultimate Warrior at WM12. The match lasted about a minute and the Warrior had to carry for the whole minute.The people that like Triple H don't know anything about wrestling, they just buy into whatever the WWE is selling.By the way I love this book, I keep a copy of it in my bathroom at all time, but not to read.",0
"Disney fails in the most simplest of tasks: The menus are slapdash and the supplemental material is unmemorable. The commentaries by James Earl Jones are informative, but useless and the shorts are NOT shown in their entirety. Disney has done us the favor of removing the opening and closing credits from each short. Admittedly, my criticism of this DVD is probably one only hard-core animation fans will be able to relate to, but I find this DVD to be unacceptable.Maybe in some alternate universe Disney is releasing a 'Tall Tales' DVD, not in some feeble attempt to make money off of patriotism, but because they want to present their classic shorts the way they deserve to be presented. A world where Disney would even include 'Pecos Bill' and not think they'll offend people because he smokes cigarettes(like anyone cares).If you just like to watch cartoons, rent it. If you like to buy this kind of stuff for posterity, it's not worth the DVD it's burned on.",0
SOB-FEST!: The details in Brians book can bring even the hardest heart to tears. The trauma and other events poor Brian went through is also documented here. I Loved it!,1

"A.W.F.U.L.: I eagerly awaited the arrival of this product. But was disgusted by the ingredients. I tried it anyway....just to see. First, it smells like nasty cheap drugstore perfume. Secondly, it burns in an irritating way. Not pleasant at all!! Third, when Hubby and I engaged in relations and he got a taste of it...he nearly threw up. So I tasted it myself....G.R.O.S.S. IT is like you just put a perfume cap in your mouth. Try that before you buy this if you enjoy anything orally related. Just disgusting.",0
Don't Buy!: I can only rate this with one star should be less. So many authors and self publishing out there I guess a stinker has to slip in. What a disappointment. I bought this book with hope that I would get some useful insight into parenting. What I got is a useless book. If I lived in a cave this book might of been helpful. Now I have to figure out what to do with the book. Not even enough weight to hold a door open.,0
"Great recipes: This is a great cookbook. The recipes are relatively easy and the author lists easily found substitutes for hard-to-find authentic thai ingredients. The only problem I have is with the layout of the book. It is organized by region which is nice in the sense that you can read about the region and see what they eat but for practicality, I would prefer appetizers, entrees, noodle dishes, desserts etc. grouped together.",1
"OK but not as advertised: The device seems to work just fine but it is not quite as advertised.The Eforcity Notebook Cooling Fan with Card Reader + USB Hub does NOT contain a card reader.It does, however, have a power input for the USB hub but no power adapter for it and no instructions on what power supply would be required if you wanted to use it.The fans seem to work OK and that's what I really bought it for. My computer does stay on it if the two little rubberized nubs at the back are flipped up.It's smaller than I expected, but that may be my fault. It does say ""notebook"" and I am using it on a MacBook Pro.If it hadn't said ""with Card Reader"" I would very probably have purchased a different product so I feel pretty gypped by the lack even if not so badly that I want return it.",0

Suze's 9 steps: The part about the first time I incountered a bad or big expierence with money. Is when I saved $500 for my first car and got chewed out by my Dad! Like what dose a 18 yr old want with a car. Suze's book brought that out. My first expierence wilth cash. Have her book on tape. Next one I buy will be a CD.,0
"Heavy Stuff: This book was given to me as a birthday present and it was certainly a very sobering read. A mission behind enemy lines goes pear shaped from the get go and our highly specialised SAS team is straight into a fight for their lives.The bulk of the book is around the capture and subsequent torture over a long period and you have to wonder just how much the human body can endure. Andy witnesses and experiences incredible brutality at the hands of his captors and loses close friends.If you want to read something that is a small snapshot of a greater scenario, still true to life but not bogged down in any politics of the situation, then give this a go. But I hope you have a strong stomach.",1
"Too involved for what I was looking for.: It's a fine book, but I hosted a tea party for my daughter's eighth birthday and was looking for something fun and informative to read to the girls while there. This was too long and little boring.",0

Fit For Life: Purchased for a gift for a friend. That is what they wanted. So I guess they liked it just fine. No complaints.,1
"Almost entirely eliminates cat mess: I bought this in preparation for moving in my new wife's cat, who was supposed to be fussy about litter boxes. She likes to dig (like a dog burying a bone) and she hates being trapped in a cave. Still, she took right to this box with no fuss and the only litter that gets out of it is stuck to her paws, which is unavoidable with any box design. The three-tray design is brilliant and you need to go look at the other reviews and read up on the ""awesome method"" for using them. The only problem with this box is that it is *huge* and doesn't fit in a modestly sized bathroom. It's too tall to go under the sink, too wide to go between the sink and the wall or the toilet, or between the toilet and the tub, and in the end the only good place for it was a corner of the bedroom. Still, better an unobtrusive litterbox in the bedroom than a pile of used cat litter on the bathroom floor.",1
Way to overated insults good RPG fans everywhere.: This game is overated. The story is confusing. The characthers arn't introduced properly. The story will have you running around the same place for hours. You get killed to easy. The bosses are waaaaaaaaaaaay to easy. Half the stuff in the menus/items you don't even use. All the custimizable features arn't used that much. It's a long game but to easy. For the conclusion this game is not recommended for Good RPG players.,0
"Words: Normally, when I pick up a ""Mongo"" book, I have already entered a state of quite willing disbelief. Generally, I've saved one as a special treat for myself, but Mr. Chesbro definitely needs to write faster, as I am catching up with him!This time, however, the suspension didn't need to travel quite so far. This time, the book gave me cold chills.Don't get me wrong. Mr. Chesbro is ALWAYS fascinating, and I love the characters in the Mongo series... but this particular book I just finished, and it was close enough to reality [or maybe it IS reality] that it is actually scarry! Not that I think his perceptions are wrong - it's just that I'm terribly afraid that they are correct. I've always believed in the power of words - I just had not carried that thought to such a conclusion, but I should have. Thank you, Mr. Chesbro - it was not only entertaining - it was enlightening!",1
Amateur video!: I am a Norwegian living in the US too. I bought this DVD to show it to friends and colleagues here in Oklahoma.I was very disappointed after watching it. The photographer is obviously an amateur.My grandma could have done it better!Don't buy it! It is not worth the money.You are much better off buying a book with nice pictures.,0
Generic Hollywood Rubish: This movie is the events of Dumas' classic stamped onto a canned Hollywood adventure/love story. The formula is the same used in 80's montage movies: 1) Weak but good-hearted kid suffers as he hands of evil men. 2) Kid has a montage. 3) Kid gets revenge.,0
Small internal diameter: When i received these i found that the internal diameter of the hose was about half the size of of those that came with the washer and dryer I just purchased. The smaller diameter added time to the wash cycles. The braid on the hose was not tight and I was concerned it would wear. Other hoses of this type have a clear vinyl coating. I returned these and received a quick refund; as usual.,0
"malaza malagasy: This book covers a wide range of topics for anyone interested in Madagascar. I've found it especially useful for general information about the island's paleo-history, as well as more specific information in my field of zoology. The editors have done an excellent job of organizing the material into a good flow of reading. Seems to be an easier read than the earlier ""Key Environments: Madagascar"" (1984). The ""gloomy"" outlook that may exist for the wildlife of Madagascar is not just presented to depress the reader, instead they present a positive outlook in their last chapter using Ranomafana National Park as an example. A must-have for anyone interested in this unique island (and with its interesting people, history, and animals, that should be everyone!).",1
"Great For The 6 Months It Worked: This is a great coffee maker for the 6 months it actually worked. I will not purchase this model or any Black & Decker model since this guy had such a short life.One down side is that is turns off after being on for 2 hours. I thought this was a great feature when I ordered it...so I never have to worry about leaving it on by accident and leaving the house. However, there are many mornings that I make coffee very early and by the time my husband is ready for a cup, the machine has turned off. Coffee snobs would say you should make a fresh pot if it has been sitting out that long...but we aren't that fussy and wish this feature could be switched on or off to suit our needs.",0
"Don't even think of watching this video.: ""Plastic Little"" is a fairly poorly acted direct to video ""anime"" with a story that runs for about half an hour. Maybe I enjoyed some of the goofy action scenes, but the story is so saccharine that it's insulting. The fact that this film's intended appeal more or less hinges on being physically attracted to animated characters does provide some scenes that are in a sense funny, but trust me; they are soooo stupid! The only thing that would make ""Plastic Little"" funny is if the studio decided to make a sequel. People would laugh all the way home from the video store after renting some decent animation!",0
"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: Unless you're in the top 20% income level this book won't help you diddly. It talks of going around the world, a bunch, about sailing around the world, taking adventures, going to adult camps. And a virtual yellow pages for websites to accomplish this. The stories from people interviewed are from the top 20% also. It was a waste of my money and in-between the stories the information was just plain common sense. I had really waited anxiously for this book to be published, too bad it's such a dud.",0
"Just the thing!: This was just what I needed to protect our sliding screen door from our new puppy. He managed to turn our old door into his own doggie door, and when we replaced the screening we needed a way to keep those sharp nails from poking another hole in the new screen. Easy to install and worth it!",1
"Defective, not original Apple: My charged worked for a few hours and then stopped working. The charging light doesn't turn on and it does not provide any power to my computer. Also, the plug is not a standard Apple plug (as pictured). My charger was a dud. Now I have to go through the return process and buy the real one. Buy at your own risk.",0
"great if....: These are great vitamins IF you can get past the nasty taste. I've used the Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatals and really liked them, and I expect some unpleasant smell/taste to a multivitamin, so I thought these would be just fine. Let me say, these vitamins taste nasty! I have to have a piece of food ready to swallow as soon as the vitamin goes down to try to mask some of the nastiness. I'm still taking them every day, because I paid for 150 of them and they are really good vitamins, but I won't be buying them again. I might just go back to taking the prenatals, even though I'm not pregnant.",1
"nice item, brings in fireplace effect with a lot less renovations: Plug this in, and you have a nice fireplace effect without having to run any chimney. It is compact (23"" W x 17.5"" H x 10"" D) and can fit almost anywhere you need a little extra heat. I have this in my front room on the first floor to boost the heat without having to turn up the main furnace and make the upstairs hot. It is 4500btu and can heat up to 400 square feet, and I got it for 80 bucks on sale.Sure, there are smaller, more powerful units for 10-15 bucks cheaper than this, but you do not get the decorative effect, nor the stability that this unit has. I have two small kittens that like to do their best ""Jackie Chan"" moves, bouncing off the walls and running sideways on furniture. They can't tip this over and break it. Worth looking into this unit if you want that extra pop for a room.",1
"a must if you love dogs: What a great book.It moved me to tears in some places and laughter in others.If you love dogs you`ll love this book.If you are looking for literature to share with your children,young and old,you`ll love this book.It is refreshing to read the english language as it is meant to be ,without any profanity.This book deals with real life issues of true importance in such a subtle gentle way.Issues of kindness,friendship,loyalty,generosity and spirit.I was left not with a sense of preaching or concrete ,right or wrong answers,but rather a sense of responsibility to my fellow man.Long after I read the book I found myself wondering how I line up in my treatment and judgement of those around me.One more thing,after reading the book you become very careful of what you say around your dog.",1
"shades of blue (plural): These dishes are really pretty. But no, it's not your browser or your eyes playing tricks, the little plates really are a completely different shade of blue than the dinner size. We thought it was a defect at first but apparently that's just how they are, and the cups definitely don't match, but they are made of a completely different material too. Oh well, guess it only matters if you use all the pieces at the same time, and we usually don't.Ease of ordering, delivery time and price were bang on. Yay Amazon!",1
Nice pair of binoculars for the price.: I purchased these binoculars mainly for the purpose of watching football games from my upper level seats. The view of the field is very sharp and clear. During night games the view through them is surprisingly very bright. It seems to gather in light very well. For a full size binoculars it's not as bulky as I thought it would be. To me it's just a little bigger than a pair of compact binoculars. Only problem I had with them is that they were a little heavy as they hung around my neck. And because of the weight I had to really hold it steady with two hands if I wanted to keep the image I was looking from shaking. Other than that I was happy with the binoculars overall.,1
"disappointment...: I was very excited to see that such a DVD collection of the early Pola Negri's movies had been released. I ordered it all the way from America to Poland as I'm a huge fan of Pola and silent movies in general. Unfortunately all discs are damaged and scratched which must have happened during production. The first disc is so damaged that I lost 8 minutes of the movie, it is impossible to make it work, it stops and I had to fast-foward a lot. I don't recommend it to anyone...",0
"Good review, too long and many errors: Though the book is a good review, it seems to jog wildly off topic for a typical exam cram. My idea of an exam cram is just the information you need to pass the exam. I'm not interested in a history lesson of PC technologies or in-depth discussions of signalling that isn't covered on the exam and isn't used except by hardware engineers.Secondly, there are many errors, particularly the wireless section which has some serious errors. For example, the book says that 802.11b uses FHSS and 802.11g uses DSSS. This is clearly false. 802.11b uses DSSS, and 802.11g uses OFDM. There are no excuses for these types of errors.",0
"Good beginning, bad ending: This book's first chapter was good. It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention ""Airedale"" (it was only written in the captions). There were Airedale pictures throughout, but they ended in the middle of the book. The rest seemed like an advertisement for Nylabone. In conclusion, if you are looking for a breed specific book about Airedales, I would not suggest buying this book.",0
not worth the price tag: poor production - basic concepts for beginners only - compared to free videos on full tilt academy - this dvd is crap!!!,0
over here you betcha: April Shawhan is the most fantastic and unbelievable performer I could ever imagine. I worship and idolize her tremendously. I only wish that everyone in the world could have a chance to work with her.,1
"A strange book: This is a very strange book. There are some helpful thoughts, if you can get past the bizzare sentence structure (supposedly part of NLP), and frequent digressions. There are two authors, although it is written in the first person? Be prepared for a bizzare world view, obsessed with money and sex.",0
A true champion of a book: This book was well written. I truely enjoyed it. It was uplifting and had great characters in it. Hope to see more books like this out there.,1
"Very tasty!: I think these are delicious. They taste like chocolate and are not too sweet. My boys love them with a cold glass of milk. We ordered them about a couple of months ago, and still have some, so you get plenty for your money. I would recommend them to a friend, and I'm planning on trying the cinnamon ones, too.",1
Interesting: Ellul discusses anarchy and the teachings of christ. I imagine the average christian would be shocked at the similarities. Ellul is always an interesting read.,1
"Wife loves it. I like the service: 3 months after getting it, it stopped powering on. I did a chat with a rep from Nespresso and had a new replacement on the way in less than 5 minutes. I'm guessing they have a problem since his first response was, ""is it not powering on?"" but they are making it right with absolutely no aggravation and no fees.",1
"Ibn Seerin's Book: It is a good book with a collection of lots of traditions within Islamic cultures for dream interpretation. However, I would have preferred not to have such huge paragraphs, as such large paragraphs are not easy to read. Other than that, this is a recommended book, but should be revised to make it easy to read. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.",1
Get this book...: If you are thinking about or have recently had the lap-band surgery it is very informtive. I still pick it up and read it as a reference guide and I'm 6 weeks post-op. It has helped me alot.,1
"Nightmares from this book: Two themes- early technology and dealmaking. The intensity of the latter left me with nightmares, I felt very real and believable. Gently and ever so politely squeezing each others sensitive body parts eyeball to eyeball until someone blinks.Reminiscent of dealing with a relative with whom you have significant areas of conflict- like war there are no ultimate winners only richer and poorer losers. The almost total lack of predictability of the Internet future is amazing. Overall entertaining and informative.",1
not what I expected: I was disappointed in these - I had expected something more elegant. They are heavy and look dated.,0
"Big Let Down: I actually couldn't even finish this book, it just started to become torture every time I looked at it! And I was moved so much by the ya yas. I felt that these were the imperfect parents no one told you about in books, this book seemed to forget all that and make up new characters to replace the ones I really loved!",0
"very good !: Very good book, it covered the History of the U.S. in great detail. However, when it came to explain state laws, it was based on the California laws.",1

"Yawn.: Is this really the same group that put out Handmade, Looking Through, and Cross-Collateral? Those top notch hyperdrive albums leap out and demand your attention. This one is unobtrusive and easily forgotten. 2 stars because it's good musicianship; alas, it's just boring.",0

"It's a round pillow...nothing more, nothing less: I don't have a glowing review of this product because I guess I expected more. It's just a round shaped pillow. It's probably too soft to do any re-posturing, but I don't know what I expected.",0
"Kingdom Hearts is top notch: My son loved this game. He plays it constantly, and it is always a challenge. I like the fact that it is Disney-based, and has challenges but is still rated E for Everyone.",1
"Powerful and indepth: This is one of the best network security books I have read. It covers a broad area, and the authors have done their research well. Even topics like steganography, which many books fail to address, are covered. Its up to date threat examples are extremely helpful.",1
nothing to scream about: what would anyone expect from a sequel to a silly and dumb film. This is just as dumb and pointless.,0
can't relate: I enjoy Mitch Albom's writing but had a hard time relating to Morrie. He talks a lot about not just striving for money and success. Some how though he could aford to have 24x7 home care. My parents both went through months of near physical helplessness before they died and I only wished I could have afford the type of care Morrie apparently received. It's easy to talk about not being money hungry when you already have it along with a university job that wasn't in danger of being downsized. I am sure he was sincere but if he was poor and his wife or a child needed 24x7 care that he couldn't afford I wonder what he would say then.,0

"Secretariat deserves better than this movie: Secretariat was a wonder of nature. Watching him run gave me goose bumps.Why did it take so long for someone to make a move about this magnificent horse? Considering the quality of this movie, they should have waited longer. This movie was not about the horse but his owner. Secretariat was, and is, exciting enough for the entire plot. Why dilute the plot with the owner's ""story""?It was poorly edited. The plot was sort of slowly moving along and suddenly Secretariat was being called the wonder horse. There was certainly nothing in the movie that justified that title at this point in the movie.Even the cinematography was poor to average.I agree with most of the oomments made by the 1-star and 2-star reviewers. And did trainers and grooms of high priced thououghbreds really use hay nets?I was disappointed. Secretariat deserves better.",0

He was thrilled to be able to fill in the blanks and I am glad that now I can read it and get to know the character!,1
"Not the best Crim Law casebook.: This book uses unusual cases to present different doctrines of Criminal Law. My professor has admitted on numerous occasions that she would not have selected the same case as the one in the book.There is very little information other than the cases themselves, which is not useful when you are trying to take away a general rule and the only substance on the rule you have is a case from an appellate court in Oregon.If I had a choice as to what Criminal Law book to use for class, this would definitely be near the bottom of the list. I don't recommend buying it unless it is required for your class.",0
"Exotic setting for a predictable mystery plot: I am only half way through the book but find it easy to read and interesting because of the location, its politics, and the places of interest to visitors.Mrs. Polifax is light reading, an unlikely CIA operative, but suspend belief and take the journey.",1
Almost worthless: So many pans come without lids. I thought this might be the solution. Not. Does not work on fry pans or sauce pans that have handles. They will not lay flat on a small pan. Maybe good for sauce pots. Not sure. I will keep them - I bought 2 different universal lids since they may be good for something.,0
So marks for trying: All over the place - clashing genres - clashing acting styles. A bit of this and a bit of that. I bought it as a Mads Mikkelsen fan completing my collection but blink and you'll miss him. A film made by mates perhaps - just for laughs?,0
"Do not buy this watch: I bought this watch two months ago, a real nice watch at a good price from a respected brand, until it fell from my wrist to a table, a real short distance but the cristal cracked, now i can't wear it and its guaranteed for only 30 days",0

His style approaches...: I was lucky enough to be given this book in hard cover to readby a friend. I had never heard of this writer but I like legalnovels written by lawyers. The author is very good the story isriveting and his style approaches John Grisham's. A good and easyread.,1
Good capo for the price.: Not as good as the G7th line of Capo but they are about half the price. I bought this for a 12 string Jumbo acoustic guitar and I was thrilled with the way it sounded. So I will probably be using it on my electrics. But like I said it good for the price.,1

"Great translation - not so great book quality: While this is certainly not a ""coffee table"" quality book, the translation is true to form.I teach gifted children (3rd through 5th) and they love to read and hear the ""old words"". I use this book in a unit I teach on Fairy Tales. We read a story and then watch the pretty Disney version. We then compare and contrast the differences and similarities.They are often shocked and sometimes thrilled - especially the boys who thought fairy tales were for girls - at the darker aspects of the original versions.",1

"Good teacher, instruction for basic passe1970s/80s dancing: Chapters include:BEGINNER - Rhythm in Place (stepping in place, bending your knees, pelvic thrusts, hip bumps), Taps (step-tap), Points (pointing your foot), Different levels (bend your knees), Chasses (double step), Review of 1-5 INTERMEDIATE - Grapevine, Turns, Hip Rolls, Walks, Swivels, Review of 6-10From the clips you will see this is old style, passe, 1970s, 1980s Solid Gold, Soul Train dancing.Kasia Kozak is a great teacher though, she shows both front & back views, normal speed first, breaks it down & tells you what body part to move instead of just counting. I will try her hip hop possibly which you can see clips on youtube, etc. on.I like Kasia & the decent production & pace.

Awesome CD: This CD performes just as good as White Zombie. The tracks get your adrenaline going that is all that I require.,1
"A very forced voice.....: The songs on this CD are not good. The song ""Robame un Beso"" sounds very, very forced. It seems like the artist was struggling alot to say that phrase on the song. All the other songs seem very unoriginal. It's not worth listening to!!!",0

"5 Mics, If I Had 'Em To Give: Straight through listen, absolutely no need for a fast forward button. Immaculate production, major label sound, and an absolutely phenomenal display of lyricism. This IS hip-hop, and as a matter of fact, one of those 'diamonds in the rough' so to speak as their style and level of passion for their music is rarely met, and never exceeded by those with millions of CDs sold, hundreds of thousands of radio spins, and countless shows under their belt. Wade Waters strives to produce music that is not only listened to, but felt, and they do this very, very well. Everyone who has listened to this CD with me in between sessions, or on road trips has asked me to burn them a copy, to which I reply; 'go buy one'. This is such an excellent CD, everyone who has been denied a copy, has in fact, purchased one.Mighty Wyte",1
"Waste of time: If you want a good history of the Red Sox, please see Red Sox Century. It is a well written account of the entire history of the Red Sox. In the Curse of the Bambino, you will find a poorly written book that is neither humorous nor entertaining. The book perpetuates the myth of curse through mistruths and distortions of fact. If you truly are interested in the occult, I'm sure there are better selections to choose from than this book.",0

Also, one of the rubber feet regularly slides off whenever the bench is slid on the floor (every time a child pulls it out to practice) and has to be replaced, or else the metal scratches our wood floor.

"Decent system: Overall pleased with the mount. It is important to locate the studs. The newer stud finders are very good and makes this process easy without having to drill tiny holes. Once the TV is on the mount, there isn't much space between the wall and the TV to make connections. It is better to have the appropriate connections in place before the TV is hung. If not, you will end up having to make the connections by feel and using a mirror. I hung a 51"" Panasonic before making any of the connections. I ended up having to plug in the power cord and cable connections by feel. This isn't a problem if you've got a readily available companion to help lift the TV off of the mount.",1
"Great buy: I purchased this towel holder for the master bath where we have two users and one towel bar. It easily fits a set of bath, hand and washcloth, or could be used for two bath towels. It requires simple assembly. The base is heavy and it feels solid. I'd definitely buy it again.",1

The doll NEVER recognizes my daughter as her ""mommy's voice""...ever! We've reprogrammed it at least a half a dozen times and still it never recognizes her voice. It also doesn't understand commands very well. Furhter, after just six months, her plstic arms and face began to deteriorate and get sticky. Her eyelids are tearing from the deterioration. This is not a wear and tear issue - it is plastic that is just poor quality. I have dolls from when I was a kid that are still in perfect shape.

"The Man!: If I could trade places with anyone in history in would be Frank Sinatra.This book shows you the man and his unmatched charm,wit,and his overwelliming appeal,not just to beautiful woman but to everyone he met.I opened it and read it it one sitting.If you are a Sinatra fan,you gotta read this,and then read it again.However,it does help if you have some background of Sinatra to appreciate it fully.Loved it!!!",1
"A Gem of a Read: I enjoyed reading ""Midnight in Ruby Bayou"" the continuing saga of The Donovans. Ms Lowell grabs you in the first page and holds you until the last page, and than leaves you wanting more. In each of her books about The Donovans she chooses a precious stone and makes it the center of her plot. She than builds her story and characters around this precious stone (In this case Rubies). The story and the main characters are than tied together with the history of the stone. Add to the mix romance, suspense, and murder and you have a read that's impossible to put down. If you are fan of Ms.Lowell you not be disapointed in this story. If you're not a fan you will become one after reading ""Midnight in Ruby Bayou"". Ms. Lowell is one my favorite authors and I look forward to reading more about The Donovons.",1

I was worried that Donna being the companion would mix well but I came to like her as much as the others. Her not being in love with the Doctor was a nice change from the past two (Rose and Martha) as it really felt like two friends on an adventure.,1
"Junk!: As others have said, the plunger sheers off after a season of use, making the pitter useless. A complete waste of money, unless you want a single-season pitter!",0
"Excellent timer: The timers work extremely well. They are easy to use and there is no annoying beep when you push the buttons. I bought these for my debate students to use during contest. Beeping buttons are distracting for speakers. These timers are perfect for debate--no beeps, easy to use (as a countdown timer or stopwatch), and large face.",1
"Does not fit 1996 Silverado: These screws do not fit 1996 Silverado front discs as listed. They are way too small and completely wrong. Therefore I cannot comment on how they work, but I will say that I also ordered the Russell 639520's for the rear. Those fit, but did not seat correctly and did not work AT ALL. I would avoid these products like the plague. Stick to manual 2-person bleeding.",0
"Amazing: TBS is the best thing that has ever happened to American music. Each song is raw, powerful and hits hard. At the same time, each is beatiful. This is the kind of music the 2000 era should be remembered for.",1
"Also a good book: This book was also a very good one, although, at times, very depressing, make sure you remember ""It's just a book!"" The bond between the girls is stronger than steal, so it's a good encouragement. This book deals with Young love, sexual desires, breaking up, and death, these two books (books meaning this is the second book, the first is the sisterhood of the traveling pants) are at the top of my lists.",1
"I like this game: I don't have this game, but after all the movies I've seen on it, I am beginning to like it. I told my dad to get it for me as a birthday present. My sister, a big Tails fan, would love the Tails' Adventures & Tails Skypatrol games. (Sonic CD,) The game I have most desired to play, will make my dreams come true. I understand there are nine games, so are there any unlockable games?",1
awful product: this can't handle a large volume of sharpening. my son used this for 3 months and it can't sharp anymore and now i have to look for a new one.,0
Missthis???: Perhaps I'm burned out on Amanda Quick novels. This stank like bad fish. The characters were carbon coppies of all her previous novels but without all the nice touches. Maybe I am being hard on this book. But I couldn't finish it. after the scene where marcus and that girl meet I was really turned off. The dialogue was just too formal and stiff. Formal maybe good but stiff and strained is not. The characters were boring and I had the been there done that feeling all while I read it. I found myself skipping all discription and just reading the dialogue because the pace was so slow. But the dialogue was no better. Finally I (...) cut to the chase. Only there was no chase. Just more of the same pointless mindless dialogue.I usually like Amanda Quick. Sometimes her stories really hit the spot. Not this one. It was a wall banger. Did I mention the whole premis is weak? I just couldn't suspend disbelief for this one. So I tossed it for a julie garwood.Like I said Mistress? Miss this!!,0
"Jibberish: Jibbs is more proof that kiddie rappers suck. The beat sounds like awful ice cream truck music, Jibbs' rhymes are so wack they are comical(at certain times) and the hook is an obvious ripoff of Do your ears hang lowExample:/Do your ears hang low/ do they wobble to and fro/ can you tie them in a knot/ can you tie them in a bow/ can you throw them over your shoulder like a continental soldier/ do your ears hag low?/Chain hang low: / Do your chain hang low/ do it wobble to and fro/ do it shine in the light/ is it platinum/ is it gold/ can you throw it over your shoulder/ if you're hot/ it make you cold/do your chain hang low?/(how pathetic is that?). Whats next? a hip hop version of the name game? If this stupid record is a sample of what you are going to get with Jibbs' album then you need to stay away from anything this prepubescent punk has to offer. F*** this Nelly clone and the comedian at Geffen records who signed him!",0
"Please re-release without visual effects!: I'm a huge Joe fan hence rating the dvd with 2 stars instead of one, but the visual effects destroy this dvd! The actual footage of the show is awesome... when you can see it through all the visual noise. It's supposed to be a live concert dvd. If anyone from Joe's camp reads this let him know to please re-release it without all the visual effects that no one at the concert would have seen, the it would actually be a cool dvd!",0
Christmas Lights: What can I say. You plug them in and they light up. And now that I don't string Christmas lights the bulbs fit my lighted ice/water bay in my refrigerator offering a more pleasant color other then white.,1
"Cool: My godson was absent for this movie in school and saw it here. It was okay he said but I loved it. Brought back U.S History facts that to this day are important to know, and all in a fun way to watch. In the end he got to answer hs homework questions and get a good grade ^_^",1
"Pointless: This movie was absolutely pointless. As others have said, the plot seems to go nowhere and the characters just seem to be mucking around the entire time. There were very few laughs to be had and most of them were honestly very predictable. Absolutely atrocious piece of cinema.",0
"even better than babyliss and other titanium plates: even better than babyliss and other titanium platesLeaves my hair shiny, smooth, soft, not stiff. I do not feel that abuses the tips even with my wet hair.I have other two titanium plates, they work, but this leaves mi hair more natural.",1
"Excellent Stand Alone From Anne McCaffrey: I have read all of the Dragon Riders Series books and ""The Renegades Of Pern"" does a masterful job of introducing us to new characters, follows the tribes of gypies that came with the Pern expedition and become the ""Traders"" that transport much of the commodities to the far flung holds. We get a wonderfully deranged evil Lord Holder's Daughter who enjoys killing and stealing!The best part of this book for me is the way it ties in the existing timeline of the original Dragonriders Of Pern Books, with the beginning of the Pern Colony in ""Dragonsdawn"", and creates the storyline continued in ""The Skies of Pern"".I will continue to enjoy this book as well as the entire series for many years to come!",1
No complaints: The book arrived in the great condition it was said to be in and I received it in the timeframe indicated. I have no complaints.,1
"McEntire Needs to Give it Up!!: Different strokes for different folks to use a time-worn cliche'. This is just my opinion but for some reason this redheaded, overrated, obnoxious singer named McEntire thinks she can act (she cannot act her way out of a paper bag). The first season was made palatable only by her supporting cast. The second season (this one) features a new opening and control freak McEntire using all of her amateurish acting techniques to mug and overract her way all over the place making the others in the cast look bad. Its a show that has gotten progressively worse as the seasons have progressed. I can't believe I allowed myself to be talked into buying this rehashed ""ROSANNE"". That is exactly what this show is and it doesn't even merit one star! It is pathetic and unbelievable. Diva McEntire (with her phony face)needs to give it up!!",0
The History of Pirates: The History of Pirates is a great book on pirates! A must have for all pirate buffs!,1
"A (...): On the advice of a friend, I bought this book sight unseen. After a few pages it became clear to me that this book was an absolute and total (sham) -- a vain attempt to capitalize on the reputation and work of Carlos Castaneda. This book has absolutely nothing to do with the research done by Carlos Castaneda on the shamans of ancient Mexico.Buyer beware!",0
"More fragile than it looks!: Although the price is right, these tops break quite easily. You cannot pull the top of the coffee pot off using this top as I have broken 4 of them already by doing so. So, if you can remember NOT to pull the top off with this glass piece, you'll be fine!",0
"Definitively a must have!: Our daughter loved this book from day one... okay maybe week one :) Now at 5 months, it is still her favorite. Every night it is the only book that will calm her down for sleep. Great image with cute words. You won't regret it.",1
all honourable men: I rather liked this book -- a bit different from Gavin Lyall's others where the heros tend to be aeroplanes. Interesting to read a novel set in a forgotton segment of history.,1
Excellent Produduct for the Price: I have never used a pressure cooker in my life but I decided to give it a try. I was astounded by the simplicity of this product as well as the delicous meal I created on my first try. The recipe book is great. It is filled with gourmet meals that can be prepared by a novice cook like myself and all in under 30 minutes!! I don't know how I lived without this pressure cooker before. It has really changed the way I think about cooking!,1
"Terrible experiences with this unit: I live in an old house as well, and have experienced two terrible events of this alarm malfunctioning. The sound is positively ear splitting! The button on the back did not turn the unit off - I ended up wrapping the thing up in a thick blanket and throwing outside in the trash to get it out of my house. Do not buy this alarm.",0
Not bad: I must say that this is the better version of all of the others that I have tried. The lingo is not dated and it's all useful. It breaks it down into parts so you can choose what you want to learn. I felt comfortable holding short conversations and ordering in a restaurant after about a month. Very GOOD for beginners!,1
"outrageous reviews: If I was deaf, and I read Antony's lyrics, I would assume that this cd was a joke.""And still you're coaxing meTo come on out and liveWell I'm a crippled dogI've got nothing to give""I would also assume that antony was a tormented pre-teen.Now if I was miraculously cured of my hearing-impairment, and I heard Antony's music, the subsequent fit of laughter would probably kill me.",0
"Addictive and Stressful but Fun: I'm a newbie in the Sims World and I must say this game got my complete attention for a while. I got so addicted to it I couldn't stop playin. I have stopped playin it for a bit now because I found it stressed me out a lot having to take care of both needs and wants of multiple sims. The nightlife expansion is very very fun, it has a lot of different places to visit like shopping, dining, parks, places to take your potential date, clubs and many more great places to take your sims. Overall the game is pretty good.",1
"Needs instructions: I spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out how to attach these battery packs to my Atomic boots. There was no instruction booklet with the pack. I talked to two salesmen at the store where I had purchased the Atomic boots which were pre-wired for the Therm-ic battery packs. They both said you just have to slide the clip over the top of the boot which didn't seem right at all. They said the square ""Recco"" tab on the back of the boots was to find you if you were caught in an avalanche and it had nothing to do with attaching the battery packs (wrong). It was finally my wife who figured out that you have to turn the battery pack sideways at a 90 degree angle, force the metal clip over the square ""Recco"" tab on the back of the boot and then rotate it 90 degrees back to an upright position. Easy once someone tells you.",1
"Can't believe I paid money for this: I never go by someone else's review when I want to see a movie; I choose by story-line. This sounded like a good story. This movie was a middle-school production (financed by HSBC: imagine that), and I spent the entire time saying ""really? SERIOUSLY?!"". From the old-type black and white movies with the stereotyped Native American monosyllabic speech, to the female Indian who uses contractions and says ""yer"" a lot, to the over-pressurized blood spewing, I did chuckle a bit. There was quite a bit of Rambo scenes, as a matter of fact, almost EXACT Rambo scenes, except in ancient costume. I spent most of the movie laughing and talking to the TV. Wait, was this SUPPOSED to be a comedy? Oopsie...",0
"Sweet little plush poodle: My daughter recently had a ""Pink Poodle"" party and we purchased several plush pink poodles for decorations that are now part of her animal collection. Pinky Poo is very cute, and moderately snuggly. It's not our top pick for a bedtime animal, but it's certainly cute to look at with her shimmering feet.",1
"Where's the Clash?: While the 12 pages of the book that actually contain info on the Clash are cleverly written (if you like British humor), there is far too little of it. I guess seeing the cover - a great pic of Strummer, with the promise that the author will ""kill my idol"" - got my expectations up too high. This book is basically a few pages of quick chronology/bio/the clash ripped everyhting off from the Sex Pistols then took off for the U.S., followed by about 50 pages of discography. What the ??Let's hear more about each member, let's have interviews, let's have talk about politics, specific lyrics, influence, etc. While brevity is key to punk itself, it kinda sucks in a book about an awesome band that lasted over a decade and had a huge impact on modern music.And what makes Quantick qualified to declare humself a Clash authority is never explained - but I think that's the least of this books shortcomings.",0
"Does not come with CD-ROM: I bought this book mainly because I will be saved the pain of having to download the program from the internet. Having never needed to buy a book to use a office suite before, I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn all the ins and outs of the package, as well as get the CD for the program. This book does not come with the CD. In fact the author points you to web sites where you can download your copy. The statement that it comes with a CD, in the commentary above is misleading and should be removed. Barring that, its a pretty good book by itself.",1
"To expensive: I bought this because I was told how wonderful it was, but when I started looking at costs of refills etc... I returned it. I am breastfeeding and BF soiled diapers don't really smell very strong so I saw no added value in this gadget. PLus we use both cloth and disposables and this just simply wouldn't work for us.",0
Can't do without...: this Java IDE. It compiled the best features from the competition and packaged it together in one slick product. The best out there!,1
"Not worth $10!: This one attempts to be a stopwatch, clock, alarm, and calendar; it cannot do any of these functions well. Every one of these functions get messed up because of the haphazard ""mode"" button. To Switch between the clock and the stopwatch, you have to go through the alarm set mode, then the clock setting mode; this causes you to set the alarm for 1:00AM and to reprogram the time! Moreover, it is not rugged enough to survive a long jog without getting messed up. Very annoying, inaccurate, and worthless!",0
"Worse purchase of 2007 for me!!: This product died within 3 months. It didn't even work that good when it did work. The fans weren't very powerful, and I found myself having to turn off the notebook after awhile anyway because it still got too hot. Buy the Antec!! Its a bit pricier, but it is very powerful and has never failed on me after almost a year!",0
"What a great read!: Peeking into the life of Karrie Kline made me feel that I was actually peeking into my own life, years ago. I remembered those dates, fondly now, although surely not then! ""These experiences will help make you the person you are meant to be "" was echoed in my head and my constant response, ""Who needs this?!""Reading about it is certainly better than living it! I laughed, I cried, but most of all I remembered and found a smile on my face....How nice to smile...",1
She is simply the best there ever was: This cd is really two cd's on one. One Christmas and one gospel album. All the songs and sound quality are absolutely moving. Her gospel songs just bring chills and tears to your eyes.,1
"UNKNOWN: This movie revolves around CORN...yes, corn, the kind you eat...like a can of corn nibblets there are many nibblets to fork your way through this film of intrigue...acting is good, but like cow corn...tough at times to figure what this film is all about???? However it is entertaining, best viewed when eating fresh corn-on-the cob or better yet...HOT BUTTERED POPCORN!...and a little understanding of German...Actually a fun movie! BUT STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT???? LIAM ON THE DVD COVER LOOKS SO CONCERNED..how concerned can you get about corn?...maybe he was a farmer before he became a man of mystery?",0
great entertainment: This movie was surprisingly good and very entertaining. I wanted just to watch a movie to relax for a while and was pleasantly surprised on how funny and catching it was.,1
"Educational: Having read the complete Bible in the past, reading the works of Josephus helped put some of the events in the old testament into better perspective and opened the door to some new thinking and understanding.Not particularly an easy read, but then reading the Bible has always been challenging and Josephus' version as put together by the author Paul Maier is challenging as well and very educational.G. D. Villalba",1
"This band sucks: This is the best band of the 90's,ha!!!Admit it they were sellouts who sang about anti establishment then partied with president of treir record label in his mansion.They were corny then and crappy now, thank god they broke up on my birthday which made an excellent b-day present. Tom Morello was an overrated guitarrist who used elestronics to hode the fact that he can't play guitar.Zack de la Rocha was a horrible singer thats why he had to rap instead. The rhythmic section was a lame excuse, just lame.Skip this band, overrated,overhyped and undertalented. Hell linkin park and limp bizkit made way better bands.",0
"So-So Finale: It's got some catchy tunes, some stand-out tracks, but really - you'd expect a little more out of his final album after all these years. It sounds like it's supposed to be a Billy Joel album rather than giving any new definitions to what a Joel album can be. Nevertheless, fans will find it a good play with some songs that get better the more you hear them; but it is a little too produced, sometimes forced, to really be enjoyable.",0
"I hate this baby monitor: This baby monitor I bought a year ago and has never worked right since day one. I bought it before my daughter was born so by the time we used it and found out how horrible it is as a product, it was too late to return it. The sound never worked. I hate it. I bought it for $250, what a waste of money.",0
"Giving up?: Not a review - wrote you a long time ago....someone from Louie Anderson ???? cntacted me and apologized for not sending my son and me the promised autographed copies of ""Dear Dad..""(Bally's Fathers Day 1998 - see previous note) I was asked to be sure to send my son's address so Louie could autograph the books. So much time passed we had given up until I received an email from ? (nope, didn't save - my mistake) What a tease! What's up? - ready to give up - again.",1
great gift: This was a gift to my grandson who saw endeavour fly over. This model sits on his desk. Just the right size. Thank you,1
Powerful: This is one of the most powerful books (experiences) I have ever read. It reminds me daily that our family is great need and that the responsibility for its condition is ours!,1
"RF blocking didn't work: The wallet itself is compact and have slots to keep the cards. However, the RF blocking doesn't seem to work. This is the reason I brought this wallet (at $60). It was a disappointment and a waste of time.",0
But was there a point?: This story was exquisitly written the characters were very well developed. but I read it and was left thinking....was anything just said? I was left thinking that the author accomplished little. the two stories by themselves are compelling and beautiful but are never resolved and never intertwine. they are linked only by a painting- created by a japanese woman that falls into the hands of a french man. his life is somewhat affected by it but overall- it's incomplete and the majesty of how one simple action can touch people on different sides of the world- is lost in a novel form. It's a poetic read but I cant say I enjoyed it. It wouldve been better off as seperate novellas,0
very pretty: I just recieved this pendant and I really like it. I'm not sure that the crystal is genuine Swarovski but it's still nice. Gotten several compliments on it. It's not too big and not too small. Very nice.,1
"WARNING!!! Incorrect sizing labels!: My knee measures 13 inches, so a person would think this is the perfect size. WRONG! It was way too small.I followed the procedures for a return to Amazon.com and put the mailing label on a 7"" x 9"" mailing envelope. It weighed next to nothing. I was charged $5.19 for the return shipping PLUS the $.94 the seller originally paid to have it shipping to me. The $5.19 is an outrageous charge; $.94 is more like it.As I had to use the shipping label for the return, I had no choice in the matter. The shipping charges were 1/4 the cost of the knee strap. Quite a rip off! It makes me not want to order anything from Amazon.com unless I'm POSITIVE it will work.Little did I know that my 13"" knee was too big for a 12"" - 14"" strap!",0
Confounding: Why is the USED one more than twice as much as the Brand - New one? Am I missing something?,1
"After 21 years of knitting, I finally learned something new!: It isn't often that I find some new tip or hint for knitting. I am not a great knitter, just a functional one. I make lots of scarves, hats, and other useful, quick items. In this book, I found hints I didn't know before. I also was inspired to make different types of projects like a cat bed and an ipod sock. I could have found instructions for these projects somewhere else or even make my own pattern, but this book gave me the inspiration to start looking differently at my needles.Although I am not totally sold on the title (is the sticher a bitch or does the sticher bitch while stiching?), I actually read the introductory chapters about knitting history. Usually I skip right past the ""boring"" part and go for the patterns. Not so here!I recommend this book for the beginner and the experienced knitter who is not so excited about sweaters anymore. It worked for me!",1
"Not good.: I bought this vacuum about 1 year ago. I've had nothing but trouble with it! I took it to a warrantee dealer a few months back because the red warning light stayed on all the time. It took them 4 weeks to find a bad integrated circuit. They replaced the IC, returned it and two days later the light came back on, to stay!(All filters are clean and always maintained.) About a week ago, the machine is now 13 months old, I tried turning off the machine with the on/off switch. No dice. The machine stays on as long as plugged into AC. I tried moving the on/off switch back and forth several times and the vacuum still stays on! The only plus is that it does a fairly good job of vacuuming.",0
"Doesn't work: I tried hooking my laptop up to my HDTV, and got a distorted picture on my TV. Disappointing.",0
"Not Impressed: I really thought this was going to be something amazing based on the trailer. I wasn't a big fan of the original, but this looked interesting. I like a lot of the new remakes that have bee coming out.This is a well made film. And I appreciate that a lot of the original cheese was removed. The rape scene was appalling and unless I just supressed the memory of the first film, it's much worse. Given the horror of what Mary endures, I didn't feel like the kill/revenge scenes were as satisfying as the original. I felt the parents often bumbled around and made a lot of clich√© horror movie mistakes. It's definitely an intense movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat, but I also heard myself screamng ""OH COME ON!"" an awful lot.If anyone is interested, the Italian film, Night Train Murders (1975) was a much better rip-off of Last House on the Left.",0
"Totally Bogus: This isn't even a good ripoff of the original film. It lacks any real drama, any characters even remotely interesting, and indeed any real reason for having been made -- except to take a great story, dumb it down for the MTV generation and throw in an obnoxious soundtrack with a lot of fast edits.This movie should be permanently grounded.",0
"Rachael: I received this book as a Christmas gift from work. All I can say is FABULOUS! I absolutely love Rachael Ray; she is very imaginative and creative with her meals, the recipes are easy and delicious, and she is very positive about everything.Several people have said that the cookbook does not have an index. Although this is true, it does have a table of contents towards the beginning of the book, separated by meal time, that gives the name of the dish and page number. So, if you were looking for a dessert, it would not be hard to find.I am thrilled to have this book. It is the first cookbook that I have from her collection, and I plan on buying more of hers in the future. This would be a good investment to make.",1
Great garment rack: I received this item within a couple of days after placing the order and could not be happier with the quality of the product. It is very strong and will undoubtedly support far more than the weight maximum indicated. It was easy to assemble within a few minutes without any tools except those supplied with it. Looks great and would be very presentable in any retail establishment. I only need it for personal storage but it is certainly the commercial grade claimed. I highly recommend without hesitation.,1
"Helpful Information: I found this helpful for understanding the basic information about schizophrenia and it had some useful chapters on signs to look for and treatments. It may be a little outdated with some of the new drugs that are coming out now, but overall its a good reference book to have.",1
"A must see for teens: This movie is on my top 15 list for sure. This film reminds me of my friends and my life and ""Kids"" is a perfect title. After watching this film it showed me how anything can happen in this world to anyone. This film is really a great film and worth your time.",1
"Good for beginners: This DVD was a little too simple for me. It would be great for a beginner, but not for someone with years of experience doing aerobics.",0
"problems with dimming scenes: i've got it and it has scenes where the lighting changes mid-scene, going from light to dim and back again...makes it almost unwatchable...dave ;]",0
Really slow and dull: This movie was not at all what we expected. Based on the cast we expected more than just a story with some actors that moved way too slow with little purpose. Wasted our money on this one.,0
"Too long winded...get to the point, please.: This book has some good advice. But it takes too long to read through the author's stories and rhetoric, to get to the point of his discussions. Then, there really isn't any solid advice. I wasn't impressed but I guess it is because I'm really looking for advice right now.",0
"Was Michael Moore involved in this??: It is a far stretch to call this a ""documentary"". A comedy would be more appropriate. I think there was more scientific fact in ""the day after tomorrow""",0
"Wonderful product: This product has been great for us. It is so much easier for my son to go potty and just have to pull down his pants and underwear as oppossed to taking everything off below the waist. He loves that he gets to ""flush"" the potty when he is done. I would recommend to anyone wo wall mount the unit as it is much more stable that way.",1
Sleeping Beauty: It was the first time my daughter has watched Sleeping Beauty. She loved it. She watched it everyday for a whole week. Couldn't stop talking about it. I enjoyed it as much as she did. It brings back lots of childhood memories of wanting to be a princess.,1
"Great for private listening: I own ""Music Minus One"" CD's. It's great to put my player headphones on and play along with my instrument. This is a perfect tool for the application.",1
"KATHRYN AS A PILOT'S WIFE - WEAK AND UNREALISTIC CHARACTER: I feel that Ms.Schreve could have researched the factual data of being a pilot's wife. I was stunned that after 15/16 years of marriage, she had NEVER flown aboard his aircraft. The fact is, that we as spouses and family, have the priveldge of not only accompaning our spouse, but the luxury of extensive traveling.Not only was she naive about his occupation, but not to know who their insurance company/agent was? This lends itself to incredibility. My husband is a captain, his job is flying. With the odd schedules and the physiological punishment on his body, does he have time to manage our finances. Yet, Kathyrn, with an only child, is unable to run to run their household. Truth be known, what is she really doing while her husband is flying?This leads to the portral of Kathyrn as weak, unadventerous and naive. Kathyrn wake up and smell the coffee!!",0
"excellent!: Much better than the show. During the show bourdain is still a little reserved, much different than no reservations. But the book is rich in detail, this is my first Bourdain book, and it was a good one to start with.",1
"Religion Under Stalin: Helene Iswolsky was concerned about the survival of the Russian church under Stalin. After decades of religious persecution, she reports, ""the walls of the Russian church have not crumbled."" When in 1937 Stalinists admitted the failure of their brutal tactics and resorted instead to ""godless propaganda,"" the Russian church was still very much alive. She discusses the history of the church and its central role in the lives and traditions of the Russian people. She was a personal friend of Alexander Kerensky, whose democratic provisional government in 1917 guaranteed full religious freedom for all faiths until it was overthrown by Lenin's Bolsheviks.After her conversion to the Roman Catholic faith she became especially concerned about Christian disunity, ""the great quarrel between East and West."" A follower of ecumenist Vladimir Solovyev, she worked for many years to heal the rift in favor of universal ""oneness in Christ.""",1
"Am I missing something?: From an objective point of view, this propably is not so (just look at all these reviews), but *I* though this was weird, could not decide whether to be badly quasi-scientific or just supernatural, and could not possibly frighten me to the least because I was being too busy thinking it was stupid. There were some (potentially) good elements, they were just buried deep beneath all the crap. Oh well, maybe I should read it again.",0
"Good product: Useful gadget, especially for young cooks. Easy to use and clean, less messy than traditional stove-top pan.",1
"What A Waste Of Time: I've been a hardcore Moody Blues fan since 1971. I have everything they've released and have thoroughly enjoyed their music, up to now. Strange Times is a boring album. There's more energy in a snail than there is to this album. There are a couple of good songs on it like English Sunset, Walking On Air, and Nothing Changes, but that's about it. John must have been asleep the whole time they were recording this. Either that or he just wasn't in to it. Even on some of Justin's tunes, he sounded half asleep or he just couldn't come up with anything to write about. Ray's 1:40 second contribution was a big disappointment after all these years of nothing contributed. In my opinion, the album is a waste of time. It is slow and boring. The only reason I have it is because it is a Moodies album and it goes with the collection. Otherwise I would not have wasted my time and hard earned money on this album that shouldn't have been made in the first place.",0
"Design flaws: Too many design flaws on this thing. Too easy to turn on the PS3, too difficult to turn off the PS3, and you end up in the PS3 menu unexpectedly.1. No off button. You cannot turn the PS3 off without navigating menus. I end walking up to the PS3 and pressing the 1/0 button on it (which doesn't always work either, since you can't turn off the PS3 right after turning it on).2. Every button is an on button. Press any button and the PS3 turns on.3. While playing a DVD, and the stop button doesn't take you to the DVD top menu, it takes you to the PS3 menu.4. The ""Top Menu"" button takes you to the PS3 menu, unlike every other DVD controller. Instead, you need to press the Pop-Up/Menu button to get the DVD controller.",0
"Fat Joke aka Joey Whack: ""That fat n***a thought lean back was in da club, my s**t sold 11 million his s**t was a dud."" 50 was 100% accurate with that line. This cd is one of the biggest wastes of beats ever. This s**t started when he made that song with ashanti a couple years ago and now he has gone full blown pop. Hold You Down might be the fruitiest rap song ever made, and this man has the nerve to say 50 is the fakest thug you ever seen? Anyone that thought fat joe was gonna come back hard after 50 called him out will be sadly dissappointed.T. Frisna and It Starts With A C - your cd reviewing privilages are officially revoked.",0
"This book has helped me to eat again!!!: I have celiac, many allergies and sensitivities. When first diagnosed I went looking for some cookbooks to help me figure all this out and came home with an arm load. This one has been my mainstay, my good friend, my right arm!!! I don't know what I would do without it. When I could not eat yeast it gave me delicious non yeast gluten free recipes. When I could eat yeast again it gave me delicious gluten free recipes with yeast. It has breads, cakes, snacks, dressings you name it its in there. You just have to taste the brownies! My son-in-law thought they were the best he had ever tasted and he does not eat gluten free! It even has substitutes, resource lists and everything you need. It is beautifully laid out, easy to follow and everything is very, very delicious! Ask my family! No one even knows these are gluten free they are soooo good! If you are on a gluten free diet or have allergies or sensitivities this is a ""must buy"" book for you!",1
This one's getting worn out...: This is a classic. Not sure why my almost two year old loves it so much but she does. We like to use the colors on each page as a way to practice our Spanish (I have her tell me the color in Spanish).,1
"Next...NEXT! (The Comfort Zone was WAY better): This album isn't even average, great or spectacular, it's just an album. The only good song on the album is ""Happiness"" the rest are so boring that I just took the CD back and got a refund. I recommend her second album ""The Comfort Zone"" that is the most beautiful album she has ever made. This album is not. Also, I recommend Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope, now THAT'S A WORK OF ART.",0
"Frustration & Wasted Money!: We purchased this phone after our old one was damaged by water. It seemed the perfect combination of features and price, but developed some very annoying problems, which we didn't follow up with the manufacturer as soon as we should have, so we are out our purchase price. First, the handets started generating annoying beeps (hearable only by the person on the other end), then one of the handsets stopped funtioning in speaker mode, and, finally, it became impossible to dial out on either handset. We will never buy another product with the A. T & T. name on it! If you are considering a purchase of this product, run away!",0
"Excellent Home Use Torch and Hose: This torch was difficult to find, but Amazon had it for a good price. While not billed as a ""jobber"" torch, it is certainly heavy-duty enough for daily use in my art work. Best of all, it allows you to not have to hold the propane/MAPP cylinders in your hand (Yes it is rated for both gases). A nice addition to the tool box.",1
"I don't even use it & never liked it: It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, & that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good. The dryer doesn't snap in like it should.",0
"Wow, the best: I have been looking for something like this for a long time and other titles just did not do it for me. The record industry has ever changing forms and contracts and this tile with its up to date examples has been the only one able to keep up with the fast pace of the changes. A great book it really helped me and i always found what i was looking for inside this book. A great buy, i recommend it",1
bought used: came in real bad shape someone wrote in it and pages were all messed up the reading part was still there wont buy used again,0
"Barrowman On Broadway: Fun, But Let's Butch It Up: If you've seen the already cancelled NBC primetime soap ""Titans,"" then you know Barrowman has a tendency to overact. On stage, ie, ""Sunset Boulevard,"" he wasn't bad. He's got plenty of charisma and a legit-sounding Broadway voice. ""Reflections,"" to some extent, furthers that notion. He sings well. In particular, the ballads. But some of what he does is forced and therefore, turns favorite showtunes into effeminate piano bar ditties you're likely to find at some piano bar in Greenwich Village. Maybe, he should hire a vocal coach or acting teacher to help him ""butch"" things up. Or take in a David Campbell cabaret-show (this Aussie also plays the New York cabaret circuit)for pointers.",0
"Nissan Thermos: This thermos keeps my coffee warm all day and doesn't leak! The only problem I have with it is that the lid is hard to clean well because of the way it is built. The area under the lid is almost impossible to get to, even with a brush and you can't put it in the dishwasher. Otherwise, it would get 5 stars but I can only give it 4 because of this.",1
"It's Finally Here, and it's Goooooooood: I'm glad that this boxset is finally out. It's been over three years since the first.Anyway, this boxset is the successor to the first season. Yu-gi-oh! is a very complicated and intimate series. It does have a good story line and well-thought out characters.But there are problems.Yu-gi-oh, season 2 sees the MOST talking than any other season. Some of it is important story talking (which there is a lot of in Season 4), but most is simply 'What a great move!"", ""You're finished,"" and ""I've never seen that card before!"". Also, Yu-gi-oh has little to no character development, but the younger audiences don't much care for that.Overall, Season 2 gets four stars out of five, as it is a great and important season, though contains no character development and a ton of back-talk.",1
"Nice Japanese songs, but don't be misled: Despite what the title of this album may say, this is not a ""soundtrack"" to the StarBlazers (English title) animation series which remains so popular. Instead, this is a ""song collection"" of Japanese songs inspired by the series. Perhaps only the initial song -- the theme to StarBlazers in its true Japanese format -- is readily recognizable. I took a chance buying this album, hoping for a real soundtrack, and was a little dissapointed. The songs themselves are nice, but not, I think, worth the import price.",0
"Very Dissapointed.: After the first class at University, it was agreed that we will abandon this book and try to work with handouts from various sources. Avoid at all costs and asve your money!",0
Doesn't always work: Me and my brother have had the original PS2 for a while and if you play silver games (Ones that are silver on the bottom) a lot and than you try to play a blue game it says disk read error. I really enjoy ps2 but be careful in buying games.,0

"I read this with trepidation: The idea of a person aging backwards went against my scientific nature. How is this possible? Then I went to a book talk with Mr. Greer and was completely enchanted. He is a wonder person to speak with and went into so much detail about the research he did for the history part of this book.OK, so I bought the book so I could speak with him as he autographed it!! You caught me!I could not put this book down! It kept me reading and reading to find out what was going to happen next. Great book! You should read this one and simply suspend your disbelief regarding the premise.",1
"WOWOWOWOW: It's about time. A fun Harry Potter Game. What you have heard is true. This is an action Harry Potter game. I love it. It will keep the attention of anyone who has not been a fan in the past. This is because this is an action game where as the other potter games have been a hunt for and talk to collect-a-thon. Is there talking this time? Yes, but only while you are fihghting. In fact, you do not have to read anything if you do not want to. Excellent audio samples and voice acting. The game is fast, fun and creative. You will casts numerous spells. A big complaint has been that you don't pick your spells, you just always press the same button and perform whatever spell fits the situation. BUt I like it. It would slow down the action if you had to go through some menu, and it would limit the spells if they were limited to the number of buttons.Bottom line: Great action game. If you remotely like the series, you will finaly love the game.",1
"Hilarious!: This is my favorite P.D.Q. Bach recording. ""Iphigenia in Brooklyn"" is not only very funny; it's also very clever. I don't sense the same cleverness in more recent P.D.Q. Bach recordings; Peter Schickele seems to have run out of gas. Back when this was made, though, he was at the top of his art. What's funny about ""Iphigenia,"" like any good parody, is how it's done with a straight face. John Ferrante is perfect as the ""bargain counter tenor,"" forced to sing within a ridiculous range while double reeds (sans instruments) intone lugubriously around him. The whole thing smacks of Handel's more serious choral works, turned to utter silliness.",1
"WORST TOY FOR BABY AND PARENTS!!!: This toy is the WORST INVESTMENT I EVER MADE!! Super expensive for the piece of crap it is. The sound is simply HORRENDOUS. It's so out of tune it hurts! And so LOUD!! There's no lower volume setting. But it's not just me who hates it. My son will look at the lights for a little while, and leave it. Not engaging at all. If you wan't a musical toy, just get the Baby einstein take along tunes. He absolutely loves that one.",0
"Great movie! Awful blu-ray!: This is a great movie. It's a deconstructionist horror film, in which the genre is disassembled and analyzed, then reassembled at small scale at the end. I can't recommend it enough, if you like horror movies at all. It's much smarter than most.The Blu-Ray edition is garbage. Beyond the lousy packaging, it has no extras: no commentary, no deleted scenes, no bonus features of any sort. There isn't even a *menu*. This isn't because there are no extras for the movie. They're all only on the DVD edition. I don't know how this makes any sense, but there it is. Buy the DVD. There is no reason to buy the Blu-Ray.",0
"Wish I could give zero stars >:(: Please, don't buy from this seller. I've sent e-mails to three different addresses trying to get an answer from them and have not heard back.First, the cartridge they sent was damaged upon arrival. A piece was broken off that allows the cartridge door to open when the printer is closed. Luckily, I still had my old cartridge and was able to switch the doors and have it physically working again.But the cartridge won't print correctly. After some research, I've found it's probably got a bad corona wire in it.The irony of it all is they include a card with the cartridge begging you to contact them rather than leave less than 5 stars.Never again.",0
"Inkari Volumes 1, 2, 3 & 4--best music I've heard in years1: Music from the Incas, wind pipes, drums and stings. All very natural and soothing, will make the demons in your day go away!!! Instrumental music at it's very best!Amazon.com should carry this music!!!",1
"too much misinformation: This book is O.K. for people who don't mind being stuck in the system. It discourages or prohibits home birth, sleeping with your baby, and 100% breastfeeding, without a shred of evidence. Of course, not all parents-to-be share the same principles, but it would be more fair for a book that claims to be ""for fathers"" to present the viewpoints of more than one ""type"" of father.Maybe someone can write a better book for fathers later on. It is a good idea.",0
"Classic childrens book that I will never forget: There is nothing amazing to this story, yet I have not forgot it years after hearing it. Maybe it was the librarians voice, or the big blue cover, but I fell in love with this book. A very sweet, charming book with your typical mother and baby story. Will buy for my kids one day :P",1
"It's a book for men...and?: So many complaints from women that this is not really a diet for women. In my experience, there are thousands of books specifically targeting women. I find it quite refreshing that this is a book geared towards men and their weight issues and workout needs. If you go to any bookstore, you will find that almost every ""diet"" book out there is for women. Buy any one of those if you don't like this one.",1
Can't review properly: I can't review this CD properly because I never received it and neither Amazon nor the seller will respond to my inquiries! I have been cheated!Bruce T. Scott,0
"Great product WHEN USED FOR ITS PROPER USE: I have to agree with the last reviewer - this is an outstanding product, but it appears that, from other reviews, people are trying to use it in place of eyedrops. This ointment is NOT a replacement for eyedrops for dry eyes - it is a very viscous ointment/gel which is to be used at night only, when you don't need to see, and helps prevent damage to the cornea from dryness while you are sleeping. In my case, it is because I could not fully close my eye due to a facial paralysis. I can't stress enough that THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR EYEDROPS. If your eyes get dry during the day, this is not the right product for you -- eyedrops should be used. Allergan's Celluvisc are probably the best I have tried (though amazon does not sell them any longer).",1

"perfectly fresh pesto sauce: going 2 years now. still works great, no problems. I've reordered bulbs and herb seed kits. I have fresh pesto sauce anytime I want. The globe basil is a prolific grower, luckily, pesto sauce freezes well.",1
not worth the effort: A friend got this as a present and brought it to our party to used. It used lots of chocolate and tons of oil. It kept on siezing all night long so we had to keep adding more oil. The element did not keep the chocolate warm enough so that it would flow properly. We eventually gave up and we to a good old chocolate fondue pot.,0
"great for company breakfasts: I've always been the type of hostess who is in the kitchen making batches of pancakes while everyone else is eating. How nice it is to have a large cooking surface that allows so many pancakes to be made at once.I tried this griddle out to see if I can accommodate 10 for breakfast the day after thanksgiving. The pancakes came out great! Unlike the experiences of some who noted that there are hot and cold spots, I found the pancakes to be uniformly brown. I had lots of room to control flipping the pancakes. I also cooked an entire package of thick cut bacon at one time. The bacon came out crisp. And the clean up was easy.What a steal!",1
"A Celebration of Extraordinary Women!: The Quilters is an absolute gem of a book! It's a thoughtful tribute to extraordinary women who invented an art form out of scraps of cloth to record and celebrate the domestic events of families and communities living in places and times that were uniquely un-domesticated. Walter Prescot Webb, the great historian of the Great Plains, suggested the West was domesticated by the six-shooter, barbed-wire, and the spirit of remarkable men. He should have also noted the dogged spirit of the women who were The Quilters!",1
Great cookware set: After reviewing and taking a great look of of cookware sets. I decided to buy the Anolon Professional. It's really nice cooking on them I warranty that they are not sticky and it cooks amazingly. The handles never get hot. The only problem I have noticed that the lids get hot easily. But which don't?,1
"there are better books to help your kids: I wouldn't recommend this book. This book does acknowledge that moving can be hard for kids, especially the aspect of leaving your friends and trying to make new ones. However, we found the message to be strange. The child makes friends with a talking moving box who later turns into a toy. The neighborhood children aren't nice and only befriend him because of this cool toy. There are better books. If you only buy one book I recommend The Playdate Kids--Danny is Moving by Annie Thiel, PhD.",0
"It's a shame: This movie had so much potential to be great. But at the end, it left me shaking my head. I like Christopher Walken and I think he's a great actor, but he was not to believalbe as this mob kingpin. I contribute a lot of that to a bad screenplay and bad directing.I think that the plot and the idea that the movie was swaying towards at the beginning was good but the movie was full of bad dialogue and terrible directing. Some of the stabs the movie made to try to be funny, didn't work. With execption to some Dennis Leary scenes. The characters weren't well rounded and the ""twist"" in the end was just flat out stupid. I would recommend not buying this DVD.",0
Beautiful: relaxing and harmonic oriental music.would touch your soul and would take you far a way...,1
"Beyond Brilliant: This book was very good but still like all books had its weak points. For one thing, I think that too many people died. Second, the whole book wrapped up in two chapters. Other then these things, the book was very good and I would definetely recommend it to others.",1
"Absurdly priced: To the best of my knowledge, this set of John & Yoko's appearance on The Mike Douglas Show was only ever officially released by Rhino on VHS. ""Factory sealed"" is a great way to ensure credible deniability. This is likely a DVD-R. A great week of shows, and well worth watching, but not worth nearly $1,300.00.",0
"Must have for new woodworkers: I have been woodworking on and off as a hobby fo raobut 2 years and finally freed up space in my basement to set up shop. This book was a grat help - good ideas, clear pictures, easy to follow instructions. There was a good mix of easy to intermediate difficulty joints, and building shop furniture (where looks are not paramount) is a gret way to practice without wasting valuable wood. While is does not cover all of the possible items needed, it is a great start. Highly recommended if you are thinking of setting up a more permanent home for your tools.",1
"Great!: Good product. Arrived exactly as described. Color is a fuchsia purple/pink color, largely as pictured. I like the size of this one as it is not too small and not too big.",1
"Great Design that Stands the Test of Time: I've been using the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop keyboard and mouse for several years now, and have had absolutely no complaints about the function and ease of use. I love the built-in calculator button, and 10-key. The only possible improvement would be if the keyboard were slightly more ""split."" Overall a a great product!",1
Good book: Not the most exciting boook but it really gets you in the mind of the characters. King is always so good at that! Recommended to read!,1
"Gifted!: It's hard to find just the right thing to give to someone, because I can't afford to be extravagant, yet I want something classy and wonderful that will touch people's hearts and give them long hours of enjoyment. I've always loved anything I've heard by Joe Sample and, as other reviewers have stated here, his effortless genius appeals to so many people and his soulful music is something I never tire of. This album is very well produced/recorded, the musicians are ""hot and humid,"" the compositions move me and the vocalists do a nice job. The Pecan Tree makes a beautiful gift for someone else or just for you. Five stars!",1
Great read for any age group: Randy Howe has written an extremely interesting and compelling book about the flags of the 50 states. It's a great history lesson about the United States and filled with facts that will interest even the most casual history buffs.I couldn't put it down.,1
"Kid loves it, bubbles and Mickey Mouse are a kit. Big toy if you don't have space.: Supposedly this helped my nephew start walking, for his 1st birthday. Now he is riding this all the time according to my sister, 1 year later. He almost got another one from grandma but she took hers back after seeing mine....hers had no bubbles, and wasn't a firetruck. I'm told mine was much nicer, sturdier, and the fireman hat, bubbles, and the sounds/voices added to the amusement factor. He really enjoys it, and his sisters love pushing him around on it. And of course what kid doesn't recognize Mickey Mouse, or LOVE Fire Engines?It's held up well after a year of heavy use. Got it on Amazon for $29.99 with free shipping, what a deal, the grandparents paid almost 3 times that at Toys R Us.",1
"Pretty: Bought this on sale to match a ring that I've had for awhile. It's pretty, but the chain had about a dozen knots in it. It took me a good 15 minutes to get it untangled. I wouldn't recommend wearing it on the included chain which is VERY FRAGILE. Nice pendant though.",1
fast but scratchy: My DVD was scratched and unwatcgable. It arrived fast the only thing good about my order. my dvd was scratched to the point that I had to stop watchng the film it skippedd and somtimes completely stopped,0
"Oh Jewelrusalam!: Oh Jerusalem is a true jewel in young adult literature. I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book. King entwines theology, religion, history, and a thrilling plot in this facinating mystery. The characters come alive in King's story. This book expands on the established storyline of King's previous The Beekeeper's Apprentice. Sherlock Holmes has ""apprenticed"" Miss Mary Russel. Their relationship continues to deepen as both Holmes and Russel try to determine their relationship with each other while solving a mystery in war ridden Isreal. They must help this land sacred to three of the worlds great religions for Queen and country. They meet new characters which return in other books. I would really recomend this jewel for your reading. It is a thrilling mystery which wraps around you like a hurricane, flying and spinning, never knowing where or what will happen next. I hope you will read this book and that you will enjoy it as much as I have.",1
Monster Cable RadioPlay Car Stereo Transmitter: This item came quickly and works wonderful! Wonderful seller! There was nothing wrong at all with this transaction!,1
"Pathetic and disappointing....: Geezz!!! This is my introduction to a Moody Blues live performance on tape. Man, what a disappointment. First of all, what's that thing with two drummers? And Graeme Edge playing like he's on Prozac...Also, I never, NEVER, expected Justin Hayward to play so emotionlee alive. He seems to be playing just for the paycheck, no emotion at all, just going through the motions... John Lodge seems like a Las Vegas crooner, and porr Ray Thomas spends half of the show doing nothing but banging his ""pandeiro"".I like this band very much, but this DVD was a huge disappointment. I'm gonna sell it right now.",0
"Nice, except the last part.: This was a beautiful, atmospheric soundtrack, except for the garbage sing-song tacked on the end.",1
Radio Head meets Joe Walsh: Great production. Someone gave me their copy and said try this and I think it's great stuff. Prog rock meets E meets some serious production meets good songwriting.,1

I have dozens and dozens of them made by Golden Harvest, with the little handles on them like the drinking mugs, but I cannot find the lids and rings for them. Can you help? They are about 3/8"" smaller than the small Ball Mason Regular Dome lids. Our ministry could use 100 or more of them if the price is right and, of course, if they can be located. Good hunting! Rev.

"small convienience: The book is not only small and easy to carry, but packed with easy-to-find information perfect for any medical student doing their family practice rotation. I would recommend the series for all the other rotations also. The question-answer format helps outline key points for each subject. The only thing I didn't like about the series is that they are not spiral bound.",1

I LOVE THESE GUYS: i have an 18 month old who loves music so naturally she loves the Wiggles. She already know the dance moves to at least one song. We first saw the Wiggles in short little skits in between shows on the Disney channel and she fell for them instanly. I knew had to get the tapes this is the first one I have bought and I think that I will be getting more very soon. We want them all.,1
"It's practically empty.: The book is obviously written for Netscape, like so many other JavaScript books, neglecting the fact that more people use IE.There is code on almost every page that can be used without modification in your web pages to add functionality, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. However, there is almost no explanation for how or why the code is written, and absolutely nothing to detail syntax, properties, or functions the code.After reading the entire book, a reader would still be left unable to write their own code.",0
"A nice knfe, but . . .: This is a nice knife, but the blade tip does not go down far enough in the handle when closed. So, if you finger rubs along the top, it will snag/cut your finger (which happened to my daughter).",0
"Excellent sound.: I bought this together with the ten dollar V-Moda and at first, I was disappointed. It sounds pretty good but hardly any bass. But as I keep using it, it keeps getting better and now I think it's worth the money. The sound is crisp and the bass is what it should be. Not a very good noise cancelling feature but good enough for my purpose. I bought this because I don't like listening to people screaming on their cell phone. It works. The leads are rubberized so it does not kink or or get tangled up. Good deal.",1
"Mediocre melodrama from an otherwise talented author: ""Love With a Scandalous Lord"" was the best romance I read last year (and will remain one of my favorites for a long time)but this was a disappointment. Kitty was a bit annoying and didn't use good old American sense. The hero's tactics weren't really noble or heroic. I love Victorian England and she could have utilized the time period more. This couple just wasn't as passionate or exciting as some of her heroes and heroines.",0
"King's Everest left unclimbed.: The previous reviewers tackled all the plot weaknesses that I could imagine so I'll make this rather short. The thing is, if anyone is looking to buy book 7 chances are they read 1-6 and have to read 7 anyway. The series is the only thing I have ever liked by King. Well, that was true until the end.(final 3 books) The Dark Tower epic should have been King's crowning feet, his Everest. Mr. King not only didn't make it to the top, he only got about a quarter of the way there and decided that it would be too much work to finish the climb. The self-centered universe idea was not only the thoughts of an ego maniacal man, but thoughts of a weak mind. It would seem that King got an itch to finish the series and didn't have any answers so he jumped at his first thought. I really can still recommend the series just because the first 4 books were so good and you can't have a story without an ending.(no matter how bad)",0
Good buy: Very neat case. It fits snugly;is durable and attractive. Semi hard case offers reasonable protection to the camera inside. Would definitely recommend for the cybershot.,1
"don't buy this: It is a huge pain to replace the batteries-- the best way I have figured out is to use a butter knife and twist it between the button and the battery lid-- very frustrating any other way. Also, it doesn't connect to the USB very well- mine is very wobbly. I would not recommend this mouse.",0

they really did not belive what they were writing: The book did have good things to say about relationships . IT the fact that there marriage fell apart so fast says they did not belive what they writing just writing something to sell . IT makes book void .how can you belive a book on love when the authors marriage is so bad . I pray they learned and have better realtionships in the future. I hope Thomas made changes in his life and his new marriage is better that this one. I wonder what happened to wedding rings?Marya,0

not happy: I have ordered Tresor perfume online before and been very happy with it. I decided to order a bottle recently. Price was way up from last time and to top it off you can hardly smell it. Not happy at all with my purchase. I will not order this again.,0
"Disappointing: I looked forward to seeing this film based on the synopsis and reviewers comments. I enjoy fictionalised historical films IF they are acted well and the story flows. Sadly, neither happened in this film. It may be pretty to watch but that is all. The acting was dreadful, the script very poor and frankly the characters were one dimensional. I am sure this story could have been done really well but it wasn't. I persevered through the 95 minutes only because I had spent money on this dvd. It will be consigned to the garden to scare off the birds. Not recommended.",0
"Solid Alabama Primer: For casual country fans, ""Ultimate Alabama"" is a great starter. It features twenty number ones, though they had plenty more. I'll agree with another reviewer that the definitive hits package by Alabama is their double disc set, but for those of us who may not be able to or do not want to plunk down a nice hunk of change for the double set, this one will suffice. Also, if you aren't a huge fan of Alabama, but want something representative of their work in your collection, I highly recommend this disc.It's Alabama, so just about anything they put on a disc will sound great. Personal highlights of this album include ""If You're Gonna Play In Texas,"" ""Jukebox In My Mind,"" and ""Roll On."" Everything else contained here is great.Once again, this is an excellent introduction for the casual country fan, but hardcore Alabama fans probably already have everything on this disc.Highly recommended.",1
"a movie destined to be a classic: Highlander - The Final Dimension is such a great movie that I can and do watch it over and over.Well done, great acting and worth owning",1
One Cold Night - very disappointing!: I was so disappointed with this story. Slow read - I put this book down many times but I was determined to finish it. Never felt a connection with any of the characters. I usually give books to my friends to read when I am done with them - this one I wouldn't even recommend to them. Not much of a storyline - too one dimensional. No suspense and not a credible ending.,0

"Dissatisfied: If you like really nice soft bed sheets, these are not for you! They look really nice but even after several washes they're absolutely normal sheets. The 600 Thread count means nothing in this situation. In fact, it feels tougher than cheap sheets I've bought at Ross before. I guess they're inexpensive (kind of at $49.99) for a reason. But I wouldn't buy these again nor would I recommend it if you're looking for comfortable sheets.",0

"Does Quirk work for the Enquirer?: Like many I am happy Mr. Hope made it to 100. Like many, I grew up watching his specials - like many I wanted to read more about this man. My mistake was getting this book. Naturally, it does cover his career; albeit, I think Mr. Quirk really couldn't find any true ""dirt"" so he implies alot. I think Mr. Quirk is more hung up on the homosexuals of the industry and how hard they had it that he makes out Mr. Hope to be some homophobe. Not a very good read, not really enjoyable. I do not find that I am a fan of Mr. Quirk's ""writing"" style. In all fairness he does make some interesting points, but they are not worth the read in what could have been a potentially good book.",0
"Halberstam must be knighed: a masterpiece in social history.: Social history at its finest. The Fifties is a novel with real life characters. Barely misses a second of history in that seemingly idyllic but quite turbulent decade. His thesis which focuses on the tumoult of a decade which has always been viewed as being oatmeal-ish is unique and thoroughly proven. The chapters on Ray Kroc, Kemmons Wilson, Leavit, Korvettes, Pincus, Keansey, Brando, Monroe, the H-Bomb, Peyton Place, Harley Earle, Korea, Milton Berle, the Quiz Show scandals...actually all of the chapters, are fascinating.Please, I beg you, read this book. E-mail me, I will lend you my copy.",1
"Sex to music!!!: ""Violation"" has got to be one of the sexiest songs ever written..{if a song can be sexy!} A pure lesbian love fest that I used to play continuously to put me to sleep and to relax by. The stings are magnificent in these songs. Not your ordinary disco dance songs, ""One more minute"" was the only one I ever heard at a bar like the ""PIER ONE"" on DC in the late 70's. And maybe ""Je' taime"" once or twice. This also is a great beautiful song that was redone by Donna Summer. But the opening stings in this song are worth the price of the CD in my opinion.",1
"This Book is Wonderful!!!!: I first heard about this book and NFP at our parish's marriage preparation classes so I went home & ordered it. I have almost finished it and I must say that the information in this book is very valuable. I thought I knew alot about the female reproductive system, but I learned so much from this book I was so impressed! I always thought the Catholic church only approved the Rhythm Method for family planning which I've heard is not very reliable. NFP is so easy and can be just as accurate as taking the pill but without any harmful side effects. Some people might object to this book because of the strong religious morals of the author, but if you are a religious person like myself then you will probably learn a thing or two about sex, birth corntrol, marriage, family and the church that you didn't know before. All in all I highly recommend this book to all married couples, especially newlyweds, it will really bring you closer together!",1
"Another Lousy DVD print!: This is my fourth(and last) silent movie(on DVD) added to my collection.Print is so BAD, I was unable to complete watching this film. Box promises best print available but do not believe it - it sucks! Other silent films(on DVD) also offer extremely poor quality. No more silent films for me which is a pity because they are an important part of history.",0
"A good devotional, as well as a glimpse into Lincon's faith: This reprint of the sole extant copy of a tract published in 1852, which was probably but not certainly given to Abraham by Mary Todd, is inof itself an excellent daily devotional. Unlike many contemporary devotionals, the commentary after the daily passage is brief, to the point, and timeless. Carl Sandberg's prolog provides us with some further information about Lincon's faith.",1
Gimmick band: This is a gimmick band that plays death metal lite soda. Music by metalcore kids for metalcore kids.,0
"Disappointed: Not good. Model in a bottle much, much better and for less money. Did not sustain through heat & sweat. Not reliable. I love this line, so I purchased on faith. This just didn't work for me...but I highly recommend Paula Dorf makeup.",0
"question about disclaimer: I wonder why there is the following information on this product's box:""This product is not proven effective on nails or scalp"". I just started using it today so I am concerned I will be using it for a long time hoping for positive results just so that in the end I will find out that there is a reason why they purposely wrote that on the box...",0
A preety Bad cd some good songs though: there were 1 or 2 horribable songs there others were just ok it seems like some of the songs are not up to date because the movie is a few years old.,0
"Heart of Texas, vol. 1: Heart of Texas, Vol. 1: Lonesome Cowboy / Texas Two-StepNot as good as Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series. I found this story to drag on so unlike her other books.Other stories were much easier reads, this took over a month to wade thru the plot.",1

"The All American Man Movie: This is one of the camp movie greats of all time! It has a little bit of everything for everyone!1-action 2-romance 3-action 4-girls 5-ACTION!oops, I may have listed action in there a little bit more then once, but it is only because I HAVE TO! The fight scenes are amazing! The most impressive would have to be, of course, the China Town battle. The highlight of which, is Cameron Diaz's flying kick to the tummy of the bad guy! It is sooo neat!Rent this one today!",1
Best Sun Visor: This fits just perfect in my 2008 ES350 Lexus. It really does make a big difference in the temperature in the cabin. It is not flimsy. I am very happy with this purchase.,1
"Another Trip To Meeksville: This compilation covers Joe Meek's productions involving instrumental groups and pieces. And you get a stereo mix of the classic ""Telstar"" to boot plus other unreleased sides. Of course anything involving Joe Meek can involve anything from great to completely horrible but this set is mostly decent throughout with just a few clunkers I choose not name, you have to decide that for yourself. Also included are thorough liner notes with information about the tracks and the groups. So if you a fan of the Shadows you will definitely like this.",1
"Great start, but petered out in to a dull and rambling book.: I was looking forward to this book because it sounded so humorous and cozy--and, indeed the first half of the book was excellent. It started to bog down in the middle, most unfortunately, and I was only able to skim the last half. This is the first book I've read by this author, but even the entertaining first half of the book won't motivate me to read another.",0
"Old fools never die: Leave it to Neil to cash-in sell his Mau views.This is nothing more than a flower/fool child and doesn't have a clue about the world. This is a sorry excuse for ""music"". Lost in the 60's?",0
"Don't worry about the Onion Skin, Get Out of the House, buy one of The Best Thing's from 1989 and start Dancing in the Storm!: There is a reason why songs from These Here Are Crazy Times dominate Boom Crash Opera's greatest hits album The Best Things and that is quite simple, 1989 is when they topped the charts like never before and released their best songs. Who can forget classics like Onion Skin, Get Out of the House, The Best Thing, and Dancing in the Storm. Buy this or if it is overpriced The Best Things isn't a bad option either. Either way you will go, go and keep playing these songs for more than just one more time!",1
"Undelivered item!: I have not received the item yet! I ordered it about a month ago, wrote to the seller a week ago, the date by which it was supposed to arrive, and have not yet heard back.",0
"Meh: Not a bad book, per se, but it was used in a graduate class. This book would be much better suited for high school kids.",0
"new design is useless: I had the older swiffer sweeper vac and LOVED IT! It eventually died-would not hold a charge, so I replaced it. The first thing I noticed was that the power button is no longer on the handle. I didn't like that change but could have gotten over it easy enough if the thing actually worked! My old version one would visibly pull things into the vacuum, crumbs, cheerios, dog hair, etc. This new one just pushed it a long and then when I am done 'vacuumming' I have to get out my real vacuum and suck up all the stuff it left behind. This is no better than a regualr swiffer without the vacuuum part! At first I thought it was just me until my Mom was complaining about her new swiffer. Same complaints. Soooo dissapointed!",0
"There are better products like that out there.: It is fairly heavy, but that's not the problem. The problem is that the cover on the handle slides off so easily that it's impossible to do any work with it. Plus the 'hoe' part of it is smaller than in similar products. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the 'weed pulling' end of it works pretty well.",0
"The truth hurts!: This book was excellent. How good?Exhibit A) This one book is published and the liberal news community freaks out.Exhibit B) Posting by CBS news employees of ""one-star"" reviews painting CBS as a conservative corporation as a means to insinuate CBS news is conservative.Let's be realistic - such polarizing reviews usually means something is up... Like someone is correct and the other side can only deny the facts at hand.I say BUY TWO copies on Amazon and give one to a moderate friend who still has some hope of reaching political objectivity in this lifetime.",1
"Shoddy workmanship, poor customer service: Yes, I was stupid enough to shell out the money for this litter pan cover, as I couldn't find anything comparable and I wanted something decorative to cover the litter pan. While this product looks nice enough, I've had two problems with it: 1) the first time I ordered this thing, the Herzher company sent the wrong color, and since I live in a NYC apartment building with no doorman (and no car, and my office is two crowded subway trains away), returning items thru the mail is a pain in the neck; 2) the second one I purchased was the correct color but the latch on the front panel was defective from the moment I opened the package -- so the front doesn't stay closed (the spring in the latch doesn't ""spring"") and my cat scared himself silly when he tried to enter and the door flopped open and clattered to the floor. Considering the price of this item, that kind of shoddiness is inexcusable. I would never buy anything from Herzher again.",0
"Metallica-fits: I'm a longtime fan - I bought ""kill 'em all"" when it came out, saw them play in small clubs around NYC / LI touring for the first two efforts, and saw them at big arena shows as time went on. My favs are 1)Ride the lightening, 2)Kill 'em all, 3)Master of puppets, 4)Gargage days revisited - the 9.98 CD, 5)Black CD, 6)...And justice for all.I wasn't crazy about ""Load"" and ""Re-load"", and even ""Justice"" is a bit tired. That said, the 8 minute long songs are not my thing at all with this band.The new CD seems to have taken the tempo and angst of the early work and combined it with the drawn out length of the more recent CDs, with the poor production quality of the ""Garage days"" EPs. Metallica always used to say how much Diamond Head and The Misfits influenced their sound - and here it sounds very much like ""Earth A.D."" era Misfits, only with the songs being way too long. I don't hate this CD, but I can't stop thinking that it just sounds unfinished when I listen to it.",0
"Definitely NOT hilarious!!: Don't be fooled by the review on the box. This movie has a few funny moments, but overall it's a sad tale of a lonely woman who becomes unglued after her dog dies. I don't think the director knew what mood to make the movie--humorous, satirical, dramatic?? So, to me its tone is uneven. Shannon's performance is fine, and the cast of supporting characters is very strong, especially Laura Dern.",0
"This seller is horrible: What the heck? I wait for over a week on an expedited item and I just now get a message from the seller after two attempts telling me to ""take my business elsewhere""??!! Ok, thanks, for NOTHING!",0
"Praetorius without his crumhorn: If you've been put off Praetorius in the past by the liberal use of flatulent period wind instruments and harsh percussion, you might try this fine recording. Strings, bowed and plucked, take the spotlight here and the result is very pleasing. Hyperion can always be relied upon to provide nice sonics and the performers are in excellent form. Some might prefer more demonstrative playing, but the slightly laid-back approach here is highly enjoyable and sounds totally valid.",1
"Very Satisfied: These plate holders were purchased to showcase books in a store. I was pleased with their sleek contemporary look and their price. They are perfect for my need. I have not tried to place an expensive plate on them; so I cannot rate them on how well they'd work for that. However for my needs, they've been perfect!",1
"A Must Read: I have to agree with some of the other reviews...a great book with great characters. It did take a little too long to develop the story, but it still worked. The ending was a good twist, but still left something to be desired. A little more work should have been put in the ending.",1
"Interesting & Historical: ""The Lee Girls"" provides a glimpse into the aristocratic Southern family of the 1800s and depicts the historical and sociological changes affecting the South and her people before and after the Civil War. Family letters, as well as diary and journal entries, offer insight into the unique and fascinating relationship between Lee and his daughters. There is also a large section of beautiful black and white photos. Highly recomended!",1
"It Came From Beneath The Sea: At first I thought this was going to be a great DVD. But even though the feature to toggle between color and Black & White is a great feature,it leaves a little logo on the screen at all times, right over the movie itself, just like those logos on TV channels. It is very distractingand extremely irritating. There is a black band at the top & bottom of the screen which it would of fit into, but they have right over thefilm itself. Wish there was a way to make this disappear.",0
"Food sticks: I had a teflon coated grill/griddle before this one that I used for years. I'm not sure of the brand but I didn't pay a lot for it, but after years of use the teflon finally started chipping & so I decided to buy this one.I thought I'd try a non-teflon solution so that I wouldn't have to worry about eventual peeling. Well, please learn from my mistake. This griddle is horrible. It stained from the first use. I could have lived with that if the performance was good. I don't think cookware needs to be a display item. Foods stick - period. I don't care how low or high you set the heat. I tried spray oil, I also tried brushing on a thick coat of cooking oil. After my last batch of botched pancakes, I have sworn off using this thing ever again. I'm buying a new teflon one.",0
"Mediocre at best: In terms of special effects and effective moments of creepiness, it works fairly well. The depiction of Kuchisake Onna won't disappoint if you are familiar with the urban legend and have imagined her in your own mind's eye.However, and because we get a pretty good look at her early on in the movie, she ceases to appear so menacing. In my opinion, the mask shouldn't have come off until much later in the film, allowing the audience to build a sense of dread as to what's beneath.The pacing is uneven, sluggish at times, and the ""twist"" ending appears forced. In terms of running time, it could very well have ended 15 minutes earlier and wouldn't have made much of a difference.",0
"arrived broken: arrived broken, spilled into the bag. after one email shipper refused to replace. after a phone call and lots of haggling, they did. it sort of works, one needs to double the amount.",0
"too pricy: Sorry, Amazon, but you are selling this product for truly 3x the price I found elsewhere by doing a Google search for it.",0
"Doesn't fit my drill: B&D replacement parts site indicated this was the proper replacement battery for my drill but the battery has a plastic tab at the base of it that prevents the battery from fitting into my drill. Unless I can exchange it, this will be a total waste of money.",0
"Good News Bad News: The Ram function is adequate and will accommodate 16 oz cans without the hopper. The Hopper however is one of the worst cheap thin rubberized plastic pieces of China junk on the Planet period !Be prepared to have 8 small tie wraps to hold the 4 separate ""POS"" sides that are designed to snap together (did I say POS).I actually used aircraft safety wire to hold together the worlds worst design EVER concieved !Other than that, after one day of use (60+ cans) the main frame & can ram mechanism has not failed and does a good job.",0
"Embarassingly bad...: First of all, this is not my type of movie at all, but Colin Farrell was in it and my Husband was interseted so I decided to give it a try. UGH. This movie was sooo bad. The acting(if you can call it that), the plot....(was there one?)....the whole thing was so cheesy I cringed with discomfort while watching...I eventually fell asleep towards the end ..I honestly feel that being passed out on my couch was better time spent than witnessing the conclusion to this mindless mess of a movie. All I can say is that this just further reinforces my belief that if you want a GOOD story, skip the movies and read a book instead.",0
"Ever Wonder ""What If"": Ever wonder ""What If""? What if you had done things just a little differently, or what if you had done it a second earlier? What would the outcome be? How would it change? Find out just how much change there can be in Run Lola Run, where our heroine relives the same high-paced, action packed 20 minutes three times, each with a different outcome. Awesome heavy German dance music - great soundtrack. Available in both English dubbed, and original German format with subtitles. I love this movie!",1
"Pretty Bad.: This game is pretty bad. First of all,the controls are just way to complicated for me. And the comantary is terrible. The story mode is one of the worst iv'e seen. Just dont waste your money on it , period. If you have a nintendo 64 , stick with wcw Black/White.",0
"3 washings and falling apart already: Purchased these sheets with such high expectations after reading so many positive reviews. I washed them the first time, they came out pretty wrinkled but that is to be expected, they are cotton. They felt good, not great, but still a new set of sheets needs a few washings. Did not expect that after 3 washings they would have a couple of small holes in them and starting to form those little balls that you find on old clothing. Amazon credited my account and I will be purchasing another set of sheets, just not these!",0
"terrific stuff: i am about to order my third bottle as i have been so pleased with this product...very fair price compared to others and it lasts quite a while ... i use it as directed, under my moisturizer and i have really noticed the benefits...a terrific value and product",1
Order of the Eastern Star: This book helped me to answer the basics of the Eastern Star. I'd definately recommend this book!,1
Does the job: I received it and it took a while but once I installed the unit on it was 100 times better than using the regular line. the lines do wear out but much slower and are very easy to replace. Order some extra lines with this.,1
"a not so great movie: This movie was pretty bad. The only thing that this movie had going for it was the inventive way of how they told each person's story. Though I might try and give this movie a second chance, by seeing it again. I don't recommend this movie. There are a lot of other movies that are more rent worthy, but if you have nothing better see then go for it.",0
Not good: Not good no one would need this book for anything. when I got it I throw it away it was useless info was not relevant,0
"This Bra Makes A Difference: I bought this bra as a Mother Of The Bride. I needed a really good bra that would make me look super nice in my evening dress and the department store lingerie manager recommended it. It certainly fit the bill. I kept it ""for good"" but recently brought it with me on a trip and couldn't believe how comfortable it was to wear all day long. Not only is it comfortable but I look so much better in my clothes when I wear this bra. It truly is ""Amazing Lift"". I wear a 36C.",1
What's the big deal?: I bought this book because I thought it would provide some insight into the world of mental illness. I was sorely disappointed.,0
"Broke very quickly: I had this tripod for only a couple of months before it broke. The entire thing is flimsy, and it's not very stable. The panning was sticky and it was hard to get it to aim upwards.",0
"Portable but volume isn't adequate: I purchased the product because I am hard of hearing in one ear; I use a digital hearing aid in that ear. My Gateway Notebook computer deosn't put out enough volume when I'm watching and listening to a movie on it. So I looked for headphones that have volume adjustments; this one had the beter reviews and was reasonably priced. Bottom line: it fits nicely in my bag when folded but even the slightest ambient noise wipes out any advantage of the volume control, which gives very little boost in volume.",0
"Beautiful T-Bird. For about Five Minutes: This model would be great for a collector. One of those people who wants everything to stay in its perfect packaging. Within five minutes of opening the box, my teenaged son brought the car to me with parts broken off. He is not a rough player, but I think this toy is not for children. It was beautiful and had incredible detail before it self-destructed.",0
"Only Book You Will Need!!: My son was born on 10/02 and I purchased this book on 11/02. I was simply trying to be pro-active in getting helpful information. I'm not sure if I'm just a lucky mom with a fabulous sleeper or if all the credit should go the advise from the book or maybe a combination of both. Ever since my son has been 6 months old, I have been able to put him in his crib awake and he will put himself to sleep. With this routine, he has never slept in our bed. He has a clear understanding that his crib is his safe haven. I highly recommend this book to all new moms!!",1
"Great Drama and Fun to Watch: I love the whole series of Burn Notice. The actors are great, the story lines are just complicated enough. It's MacGyver with explosions and up close fighting, and some sexy players. This one was great. I won't ruin the surprises. It's worth watching!",1
"Daddy's Girl: As I read Shifting Through Neutral, all I could think about was my relationship with my Dad. I've often described myself as a ""Daddy's Girl"" and it's a wonderful thing. I happen to look like him and have his wonderful personality. I'm in my mid-40's and am Blessed to have a strong black man as my father. This book is something to be celebrated. Ms. Davis congratulations.",1
"Want more!: I loved it, ending makes it a great film. A real X-Files fan would dig this one, next film has got to be even hotter! Highly recommend the book for deeper insight as well, explains even better the story while you can still get a copy. No Titanic though Siskel and Ebert gave it 3.5 of 4 stars, maybe you will like it and want to read the book, too. Some critics say is like the TV show, is what they tried to do, yes. People seem to either love it or hate it, uh, recommended for mature audiences.",1
"Stoned...again: ""Stoned"" is yet another current release from Joe Hill and Culture, a band that is still holding on- a stablizing and regenerative force in the reggae world. My favorites ""Stoned Again"" and ""Lazybones"" are sure to leave any devout listener burnt like Moises. Try it out.",1
It's Happening Now: This book is as outstanding as it is frightening -- It makes total sense and is happening to us and the world right now. A must read for anyone who wants to know where we are heading right now for the future.,1
"pretty lame: CH knows about descriptions. and some of the ideas can be good. but all in all, this doesn't deliver. there are three stories here worth reading. otherwise...no. there's some blend of horror and humour, good details and lack of details. CH should have focused on writing less and better stories, and keep a thread, humorous or horrible. some of the stories are even lousy, no ideas or descriptions. it's not enough if your father is a vampire. it's not a story. something else must happen.",0
"great music, great show: I just saw both ""O"" and Mystere the second week of January 2001. By far, I felt O was much better than Mystere. The set of ""O"" is the most unusual, elegant,and beautiful set I have ever seen. The performers in both shows are incredible athletes, and the music in both was similar, but I was really drawn to the music of ""O""--it has a lighter,haunting quality to it. Great for listenng to on a rainy day, or as background to a dinner party.",1
"This is only half of the movie: This is a fairly well done movie that shows just how hard Charlie Chaplin's growing up years were. The movie shows his family falling apart and him nearly living on the street most of the time. The acting is well done and there are some humorous parts in it.One odd thing about this movie is that the package says it is 60 minutes long when it is actually at least an hour and a half. The movie is suddenly cut off at the end with the words ""To be continued"". As the words disappear and the tape stops you feel like you spent an hour and a half watching only half of the movie. They apparently were planning to make a part two. As far as I can tell they never did. Because of this fact I would not recommend this movie to most people.",0
"Quality item: Beautiful faucet. Kohler seems to know how to make high quality plumbing products.Boxed beautifully. Arrived factory sealed, all parts present.Easy to install, took about an hour.Smooth operation.Really compliments our black Kohler sink on granite counter.",1
"Clever premise gone wrong: The Sowing Club idea is clever, but the romance between ""Mike"" and Theo was lame and lacked Garwood's trademark chemistry. It was almost like she was writing two different stories and they were just bound into one book. Frankly, I've found myself skimming this author's contemporary novels and will be hard pressed to spend money on another one.",0
"1 deck, no dice: the quality of the case and the chips is really good. however, i was disappointed that there was only 1 deck of cards and no dice in the set. also, there was only 1 dealer chip, not 3 as the photo would lead you to believe. since i had bought this to be a gift, i replaced the cheap deck with 2 decks of bicycle cards and also added a pack of 5 dice. skip this product and pay a little more for a more complete kit or at least one that you know what you're getting.",0
"Nothing special: If you really want to read it, you probably will end up doing so. I read an uncomplimentry review of the book in the Washington Post, but proceeded to buy and read the book anyway. I think the concept is what is so intruiging - who has read Lolita and not wondered what was going on through little Lo's head the entire time? But having read Lo's Diary I found it terribly dissapointing, so unimaginative and lacking in great prose - especially compared to Lolita! - that it becomes worthless. I read the entire thing, and although there were a few good parts (the part that is quoted on the back of the book is one of the few exceptional lines) there is truly nothing in it that sheds any more light on Lolita.",0
"Not bad but.......: This was easy to assemble, isn't that noisy and is easy to manuver. It works great on hardfloors but is terrible on carpeting. I have 2 dogs (1 is a collie with real long fur). It just pushed the fur around on carpets if it did anything at all. Then I had to use hose to suck up the small clumps on carpet. We bought this as a quick supplement to the ""real"" vacuum we already have. Its is being returned to the store as we speak. Its unfortunate because its a great little vac on floors...its just the carpet that it really does next to nothing on. If all you have is hardfloors then this would be a great value for the money. If you have carpets then you want to keep looking...its just not going to do the job. :(",0
"An adaptation, not the original novel.: I borrowed this eBook from my local library and read 60% of the novel before realizing it was not Louisa May Alcott's original, but a children's adaptation of the novel. This was not clear from the title of the book or the reviews provided by Amazon. Other customers' reviews referenced the fact that this eBook contains only ""Part One"" of Little Women, and not the second part of the novel, now considered its sequel, ""Good Wives."" However, it should be noted that the Little Women story in this eBook is incomplete and does not contain the original text of the novel. Do not purchase this eBook if you are looking for Little Women - find an official, authentic version instead.",0
"HomeRight 120 Review: We just used our HomeRight 120 to paint 40 feet of deck railing. When we did this before it was a 2 peron, two weekend job. With the 120 it was done by one person in 4.5 hours - two coats. The reason it needed two coats was because we had replaced about half of the railing and we were painting over new wood. Highly recommend this paint sprayer.",1
"canoe carrier: this carrier is a real piece of garbage. the tires came uninflated and very difficult to inflate. and i will be curious if they stay inflated, stay away from this item.",0

"Surprisingly Unhelpful: There are a lot of things wrong with this book. I gained very little on WAS (ass opposed to WSAD, which I don't use) from it that wasn't available in the application docs (which are pretty poor to start with). But let me sum it up with an example.The cover says ""A Guide to Building J2EE Applications"". In the index under debugging, I find:debugger, 78debugging business processes, 461-462I don't know about anyone else, but such minimal coverage of such an important topic makes me think that the authors must not have ever actually developed an application using WAS.",0
"Yucchh!: All it takes is the first three bars of one of these concerti to realize that the performance resembles that of an excellent high school orchestra led by an old man, both of whom are afraid of offending anyone by performing something by the revered Master with spirit or personality. A completely forgettable and unessential recording you'll be grateful to avoid.",0
"A startling and unusual collection: I initially read this collection of short stories when studying language and literature and was bowled over, because Kennedy's writing and characterisations come across as both startling and fascinating. Having re-read this, I'm still willing to grant it the 'unusual' tag, but I was not quite as wowed as I was when enjoying them without the benefit of having read a lot of short fiction. Two stories still stand out as really special - the one that lends this connection its title, and 'Tea and Biscuits', both dealing with 'ordinary' people thrown into sudden change by a single event.",1
"VERY DISAPPOINTED: JUST RECIEVED THIS PIECE OF JUNK CHORD FINDER, IT S THE WORSE ITEM IVE BOUGHT ONLINE.I WOUNDNT ACCEPT IT EVEN IF IT WAS FREE, ITS HECKA SMALL AND CANT HARDLY SEE THE LITTLE TINY 1X1-1/2 INCH SCREEN LET ALONE THE KEY CHORDS THERE SHOULD BE A LAW AGAINST FOOLING OR MISLEADING THE PUBLIC WITH ITEMS SUCH AS THIS.

"Great buy!: I tested this item at Sony store before purchasing it online. I am extremely happy and satisfied with this headphones. I use it alot when I'm at work (to avoid noise and hear personal conversation) and also when I am on public transportation. The sounds and especially the bass, which I like, are great. I cannot wait to use this when I'm on vacation (airplane). The only con: since it is new, my ears get sore (squished) after awhile but I think it will be ok if I continue to use it.

"you cant go wrong with either the Yamaha 150w or the Yamaha 350w: We closely scrutinized both the Yamaha 150w and the Yamaha 350w for our outdoor patio enjoyment. Wow, both are SUPERB! And for a fraction of the price of their main competitors, Polk and Acoustic Research. Considering we have Polk indoor speakers in our sunroom and AR303As in our home theater setup in our family room, we knew the great quality we would expect to receive from the competitors. Wow! The quality of the construction and the quality of the full-range sound in these OUTDOOR speakers are absolutely amazing!If you have a few extra dollars to spend, may I suggest the Yamaha 350w. If not, you will NOT go wrong with the Yamaha 150w.",1
"Repeatedly fell off my faucet: I'm sure the filter did everything it was supposed to do in filtering out our water, but it fell off our faucet at least twice a day (sometimes we'd make it through a whole day and it would only fall off once or, on a rare occasion, not at all).Before anyone asks, it was installed correctly every time; it just couldn't handle the weight of the water from the faucet coming down on it when the pressure was on medium to full. Avoid this and get a pitcher instead.",0
"Disappointing: I absolutely loved Al's previous two collections of political essays (""Rush Limbaugh"" and ""Lies""), and was very excited to see this one being released. Unfortunately, it is uncharacteristically boring and unoriginal. There is surprisingly little humor, and without this Al is no different from any of the other progressive writers documenting Bush's faults. If you tend to read progressive literature or news items (including The Daily Show, Alternet, Media Matters for America) and can see past the mainstream media's conservative bias, there will be nothing new, surprising, or interesting in this book. Here's hoping Al gets back to what makes him great--shorter articles with a greater emphasis on balancing his anger with humor.",0
"Not good enough...: I bought these headphones to replace a pair Labtec LT-835s which I'd been using for five years. I am not an audiophile by any means, but the audio quality of these headphones does not meet my expectations. They sound kind of -- echo-y, I guess. Plus, the earcups are too small and the whole unit grips the head much too hard. These factors combine to make it a pain to use the TD-80 for more than 15 minutes at a time.The per-ear volume control sounds interesting (and even useful) but is not well implemented. The position and looseness of the dials makes it easy to jog one while you are putting them on or taking them off, throwing the L-R balance out-of-whack.I'm sending them back.",0
"Not bad but a bit over priced: I've used it on several flights now. It does not completely block out all noise but it does an adqueate job so that I can listen to my Ipod without going deaf during a flight and it allows me to snooze during a flight. I recommend the bigger orgiinal quietcomfort because, it uses 1 AAA battery. I rather carry a AAA battery on a flight rather than a bulky recharger which is what's required for the smaller quietcomfort 2. The headphones are not adequate for vacuuming or for mowing the lawn; it doesn't block out enough noise for those uses.",0
"AT&T Customer Service SUCKS! Great Phone.: AT&T customer service sucks. I was with Sprint PCS before, and their customer service was far better. I am regretting the move. BEWARE OF AT&T.Great phone. Good features. But in a noisy environment you would not hear what the other party is saying. The maximum sound (both ringer and call volume) in this phone is almost equal to the minimum sound with my previous Samsung A500 Sprint phone.Other than the issue with the audio volume I am very happy with the phone, but once again AT&T has a very bad customer service. I would not recommend anyone to come to AT&T.",0
"One good song, nine annoyingly average ones...: I have seen Harvey Danger three times in the great city of Seattle, and I am of the opinion that they DO NOT perform well live, with just one exception: ""Problems and Bigger Ones"". Unfortunately, this is also the exception on their debut album, Where Have All The Merry Makers Gone? I was extremely disappointed with their performances and their album, and I DO NOT recommend that many people but this trendy little album.",0
"Psycho: Psycho is a love it or hate it movie. For some the psychological elements may be hard to grasp. It is not the type of movie that will cause you to jump out of your heart, but keeps you curious about what Norman is thinking about. Worth watching at least once.",1
"Everything we needed in a DVD player- 4.5 Stars: We have had this for about four months. In those four months we have used it many times. From all the DVD's we have watched, only one had a problem playing in this DVD player, and I dont think it was the palyer's fault. The DVD was not in very good condition. It is a major improvement to the one in our TV, and all the others we had. It is sleek and looks really nice. Sometimes we can hear a whirr, but that is no biggy. It is very nice.",1
"Diasppointment: I was drawn in by the price and fair amount of good reviews. However, the clock isn't worth anything if it doesn't work, and my clock does not work. When I set it for 30 minutes in advance it works perfectly fine. But when I wait for it to awake me in the morning... nothing. It has caused me to be late for school on numerous occasions and I have just stopped using it. Spend a bit more for a clock that works!",0
"Lame Uebermensch: There are a bunch of movies here, like 6 of them. Fortunately, each of them has the same quality special effects, acting, and script: lame. I know Superman is supposed to be kitchy, but from time to time, it seems that somebody is trying to break out of the box. It just isn't working, the box seems to be made of Kryptonite, because when they try to break out, it dies.I wish somebody would approach me to write a Superman script. I wonder if it would turn out just as much of a disaster as those 6 films. I mean, maybe Superman is like ketchup: whenever you pour it on something, it becomes the ketchup. Superman is the kitch ketchup. Anything you do with him turns into kitch.There was a Supergirl movie a while back, I think. And there was another film where it wasn't Supergirl, I think it was titled: My Girlfriend is a Superhero, with Uma Thurmann. That was pretty good, better than these 6 films combined.They are a bit too noisy to have on in the background or to try to fall asleep to...",0
"wonderful fantasy story by talented new author: 'The Guardian Heart Crystal Series' has just begun, Amy Blankenship's first installment 'The Heart of Time' is a wonderfully written love story based in fantasy. The characters and plot are very original and captivating, when I received my copy I found I was unable to put it down till I read the entire story in one evening. If this first book is any indication of what we can expect in the future from this talented new author to hit the fantasy scene then I believe we are in for some real entertainment! I would recommend this story to anyone who has an interest in stories based in fantasy.",1

I did like a few of the points about the differences bewteen VB and C# but that is not what I needed.",0

"Not perfect, but a lot of fun!: I've read all Fielding's books and I love her style of writing, so I picked this one up months ago and finally got around to starting it. It was slow going at first, but there is plenty to keep interested. By the 100th page, I couldn't put it down and missed a lot of sleep as a result! In typical Fielding style, Olivia is flawed but lovable, insightful and hilarious! I don't want to give too much away, but her mysterious boyfriend is probably one of the funniest male characters I've read in a while (although he's supposed to be a scary terrorist!) The whole effect was wonderful. Like I said, it's not perfect but a fun read... so I really don't understand the bad reviews. Buy it and enjoy it!",1
"another cookbook disappointment: I was very, very excited to get this cookbook. I am not a vegetarian, but do try to eat vegetarian whenever possible. As a result, I was looking for a good cookbook to increase my options. Many of these recipes are very time consuming and not necessarily worth the time put into them. A lot of the ingredients are also difficult for me to get at my local supermarket. I am still looking for a good, solid vegetarian cookbook.",0

Impossible to open: This cup is impossible for myself and my husband to open! We were only able to use this cup once since it never opened again. I have a friend who is having the same problems with this cup.Also it is not what we were looking for it is to spill proof I was looking for a cup to transition from the playtex straw cups to a regular cup. I wish we had removed the valve before giving it to my daughter.,0
"Poor Quality: I was very excited about this collection of nostalgic Christmas programs because my family has been watching many of them year after year on my father's aging projector. It was definitely time to take a step up in technology. However, neither of the DVDs in this collection would play on the DVD player. We were able to get them to play on our computer, but the video production was of such poor quality, we would be better off watching them on reel-to-reel. The vids look like someone copied them to DVD from a VHS tape. Because they are not mastered, the sound differs from one vid to the next. Some videos froze and others skipped.When I requested a refund from Amazon, they were happy to oblige and said that I needn't bother returning the DVD collection. That should tell you something about the product quality when Amazon doesn't want to be bothered with restocking it.",0
"Buy an Avishai Cohen album, just not this one.: Cohen remains one of my favorite contemporary composers and musicians, but amony his body of work there are a few duds. This is one of them. ""Unity"" is another. While even on these albums there are moments of raw brilliance, there is a tendency to become to groove-oriented, become bogged-down, even, dare I say it, smooth.",0

"It could've been better: Merlin could've been a better movie. I could point out all of its faults from beginning to end, but that would be wasting my time. There's enough here to add a commentary audio track on the subject alone. Unlike many bad fantasy films that are awful from the get go(DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS to name one), Merlin could've been one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. That's what really burns me up inside. The pieces to the puzzle were definitely there, but never quite fitted together. To make matters worse, Kathryn Bigelow(the talented director of POINT BREAK, and the horror classic NEAR DARK) was originally slated to direct Merlin. But negotiations fell through, and they had to settle for Steve Barron(who?!?!?). For NBC, the rest is ""kick yourselves in the head"" history. For viewers, another waste of time.",0

"The illustrations was better than the writing....: I have nothing against Madonna and her idea of writing children's book (koodos). But, WOW! Please stick to writing music not a book. Some famous people do successfully write a children's book but in this case, Madonna should have seeked help and advice from a good children's book writer. As an Illustrator who love creative children's books and I hope one day to write one, I thought the Illustration in this book was fantastic! The story was pretty much unrealistic especially this day in age for pre-teens. Maybe if Madonna tries to write another children's book, perhaps she should anonymously pass the rough draft to a few writers to proof read and give a honest critique before she decides to publish a book. Sorry Madonna.- Your true fan.",0

"A problem with trust: Anyone who has read an authorative work on possession like Hostage to the Devil back to back with this book can't help but wonder a bit about the sincerity of the author. The jacket claims she is on faculty at Denver Seminary and she is certainly deeply invested in her faith but an element in all possession includes the invitation of the phenomenon by the possessed. To try to blame it on someone else who happens to be at odds with her faith is a bit much. Anyone with a scanty knowlege of New Age teachings can't help wonder whether this is just a piece of devotional literature cooked up by a fantasy prone individual. If she really did live through this horror, a catholic priest with special training could have saved here a LOT of grief. Taking some personal responsibility comes to mind as well.",0
"Self-flagellation disguised as a war story: Mr. Bradley spends most of the first quarter of the book establishing how guilty and atrocity-committing Americans have always been...just to make the coming atrocities of the Japanese more palatable. It's hard to imagine a stranger book: it sells itself as a history of our brave naval aviators in the Pacific War but loses way with its Liberal Guilt - and one-sided - description of the wars with Native Americans and Filipinos. Mr. Bradley seems to have missed the atrocities committed against us during those conflicts (he should look up ""Moros"" and ""Samar"") while he details the bloodlust of the Yankee invaders.This was a disappointing read - but excellent propaganda.",0
"Very much an introduction: A reasonable overview for the absolute beginner, though not one that inspires confidence that the author is fully conversant with the field. The fairly dumbed-down tone and the exercises imply this is for junior high school students - tertiary students are likely to want something more substantial. As a first introductory text it is useful - especially the bibliographic notes, though they are often idiosyncratic.",1

Michael Moore: I just saw this and then Fahrenhype which shows how so much in this movie is positively untrue. The bin Ladens did not leave when the planes were grounded and they left on their own with no help from the government. Several people who seemed to be interviewed by Michael Moore were interviewed by someone else and had no idea the footage was being used for this movie. They were extremely indignant to think they could be put in a movie without their knowledge. All those who think this is great should watch Fahrenhype and then form an opinion.,0

"High regard for author's product.: World leaders should have the wit to learn that all wars teach lessons. If they do not have the sight to do so, they were faught for naught and those who have died in them did so in vain.

The author's product (secretly gathered intelligence) should be highly regarded.",1
"Couldn't Finish This One: Let me be real as real as can be: this book was not that great I'm almost shocked at how many people rated this book so high. I had this book for a minute finally got around to reading it, I tried my damnist to finish it but I couldn't.The plot to me was not as creative and lacked serious conflict between the two main characters--particularly the primary character, Rio. I felt that character never really paid too much of an enough price for being a player. The rest of supporting characters were forgettable or annoying. The dialogue and humor was a tad boring and was lacking an imagination.I will be readingSins of a Siren (Strebor on the Streetz)soon cause I do want to give Curtis Alcutt another chance to impressive me with his writing. All in all I'm not going to pretend I was feeling this book, but hey, it happens.",0
"WARNING - NOT LIVE MUSIC!: Wouldn't you know, the first time I purchase something without reading customer reviews I get burned!I Purchased this title because of the DTS HD Master Audio track and because I assumed it was a surround sound mix of an orchestra playing Bach. Quite the contrary - this is no more than a synthesizer playing out of all my speakers. Now if it was really well done I'd probably be happy anyway but it's not. I'd have to agree with another poster that said it had a monotone sound. The whole thing's just weird!",0
"Bringing Sharpe's saga ti life: I gave this book as a gift to a brother who has read all of the Sharpe series. He loved it. The backround in this companion book gives so much detail of the battles annd battle fields. Companion fills in much of what was going on and gives you a very good sense of the envirenment Sharpe series took place in. My brother was extremely happy with all Companion added to his understanding and enjoyment of the Sharpe's series. He said it was like rereading the stories with new eyes. I would say, given his reaction, that anyone who enjoys the Sharpe series would enjoy Mark Adkin's Sharpe Companion.",1

"Terrible writing: If you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an English student.",0

"The Cult of McSweeney's skunks me again.: John Warner, Fondling Your Muse (Writer's Digest, 2005)I was unaware, until faced with the cover of this book, that Warner was the editor of McSweeney's, and as soon as I saw that, I had a good idea of what to expect. Warner didn't disappoint me; the book is mildly amusing at times, but never anywhere near as funny as it thinks it is, full of annoying political snipes that have nothing at all to do with anything, and easily forgettable. In other words, a lot like McSweeney's itself.That said, buried beneath the satire there could well be a pretty good how-to book. A lot of Warner's core advice (or the opposite of a lot of Warner's core advice, depending on the topic) is sound. Naturally, there's nothing you haven't seen before, but then, when was the last time you picked up a writing book that had anything truly original to say?A little more consistency and a better sense of humor and I'd have recommended this. **",0

Consequently the back rides up and the band doubles over. I feel Larger breasted women need adjustable straps and they cut corners in the wrong place.Bought 42C and the cups are more D sized. My best guess for sizing is to buy 1 size smaller than you normally do.The bra is very soft and comfortable. I do not use bras except with white or lightweight tops and this will do the job.

"Epic: ROME is not only historically authentic, but also very engaging and easy to get wrapped up in. While certain events do veer from their direct historical accounts, these discrepancies are minor and aid drama. The characters, plot and even the sets are multidimensional to the point where the audience often forgets that they are watching a historically based program and not a 2,000 year old documentary on the birth of the Roman Empire.",1

A must for ALL progressive people and artist everywhere!",1
"Oh yeah, Party Rock, Wow...snore.: This is the one I could never, ever warm up to. The album sounds like it was written AND recorded in four days, by ZZ Top's little brothers no less.

"Good information, painful writing: Fishel sure makes you work for the information... there's not a fact that isn't cited three, four or five times in following chapters. He does bring together much disparate information about the development of a military intelligence service during the Civil War, that's for sure. He has done excellent research, and argues his case persuasively. If he'd only had an editor, though, this massive volume would have come it at a third of its weight and would have been a better book. A serious lack was any discussion of military intelligence in the Western campaigns. Whether this is due to a lack of data or a lack of interest on the author's part is unclear... it just doesn't show up. If you're interested in precision on matters concerning the Civil War in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, this book has lots to offer. But brother, are you going to have to work for it!",0
"Forget the blog!: I read all of the Alison Reynolds series, and found the whole blogging part just annoying. It was like the writer was trying too hard to show she was up on the latest computer fad and was just wholly uneccessary. Same thing with Patricia Cornwell in her early Kay Scarpetta books. Most people know computers these days, we are not impressed that you do too. It's overkill.",0

Not at all happy with this product Would tell any one to purchase this product.,0

"Down Among The Dead Men: Ok, let me say this, I imagine that something is lost in the translation. I must admit to Americans Artuor Perez-Reverte is probably an acquired taste, as he is with me. If you are a fan you'll end up reading this book. Perez-Reverte in this book spends an awful amount of time on Manuel Coy's background and dissatisfaction with life and himself. All the other characters are very cardboard-like, except when one chapter is written in first person. Perez-Reverte books are usually mysteries, but this one isn't. And his translator is new. But for me, there is something about his books that I like, even the ones that don't fire on all cylinders.",0

My son's favorite toy: I bought this trumpet b/c it was the only one that I could find that was not a real one but still durable. My son is very musical and could not wait for the toy to arrive in the mail. It looks almost like a real one. The back of the box even had music instuctions so that it was easy to play a few songs. The only set back is that it sounds nothing like a real one (it sounds like a whistle). But my son is still very happy because he now has a trumpet like daddy's.,1

"Five-star collection at a one-star price!: This review is only about the exorbitant price being charged for these sets (I guess I somehow hope that one of the greedy studio execs will see this!) This show is great, no doubt. One of my all-time favorites, in fact. But 35 episodes for anywhere from $75 to $100 depending on where you buy?!?! I bought 35 HOUR-LONG episodes of the equally excellent Outer Limits for about the same price. The 35 episodes that make up the first season of the Andy Griffith show are going for half that at 30 bucks!! Again, another equally excellent classic. So, I think I'll buy the Andy Griffith show, pass on this latest TV studio rip-off, and catch the TZ marathon on Sci-Fi again!",0
"Bad reception, terrible arm band.: I too have noticed bad reception in a metro area like other reviewers. I would like to add how bad the armband. This is my second Sony Walkman in 2 years. The second replaced my first because the metal in the armband rusted out and basically turned into rust dust that would stain my arm clothes during workouts. I used this to run outside but never in rain and both rusted out after a month or two. Of course, you can't replace the armband so you are forced to buy another player just because the arm band is no good. Needless to say I will be moving away from Sony for my next workout headset.",0
"Not the bees? Yeah, not this movie either!: The 2006 edition of THE WICKER MAN is, without a doubt in my mind, the very worst remake in cinematic history. It is also dangerously close to being one of the worst films ever made. I think that Robin Hardy, Ed Woodward, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland and all that were a part of the 1973 version (a great film everyone should see) should get a free kick to the nuts of ""George Lucas Look-alike Contest"" runner up Neil LaBute and Nicolas Cage. I couldn't believe how awful Cage was in this pile of llama dung! I wanted to turn the movie off so many times, but I was frozen in awe of how utterly atrocious it was. Watching this movie is almost self-mutilating. I know this is just another negative review, but I feel it is much more. I feel a need as a compassionate human being to steer as many people away from this movie as I can!",0
"Winx Club, Vol.3- Bloom's Secret Past: The greatest part of this DVD is that you get to know Bloom's past. Although it's a little sad, which is unusuall for the Winx Club. Kepp up the great work.",1
Great product: I bought these ties in a couple of different colors for my wedding and they worked out great! They were very inexpensive and I thought the quality was great especially for what I paid. I took a chance of the colors being a little off of what my bridesmaids dresses were but they turned out to be exact! Would buy again in a minute!,1
"Garbage: This is my second unit with severe problems. The remote freezes consistently and periodically resets itself; this causes me to have to re-program my components into the system. I have written Sony Customer Service with no response. The first unit worked for just past one year and then started with the above referenced problems. The replacement unit from the Good Guys had the same problems in just over 2 months. Good Guys will not replace the second broken unit and Sony will not respond to my problems. Last night I tossed the unit in the garbage. Too bad...when it works, its great.",0
A GREAT CD: I PURCHASED THIS CD AND IT IS WONDERFUL. SHE IS AN AMAZING SINGER WITH A WONDERFUL VOICE. I WISH HER MUCH SUCCESS. I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT ALBUM.,1
"not durable: I loved the features on this thermometer like the temperature alarm, but I had it less than a year, used it less than a half dozen times and it broke Thanksgiving morning. Just stopped working. I opened it up to find a teeny tiny wire not sautered to the control panel (?) and threw it out. Very disappointed.",0
"best tv i've ever had the pleasure of owning!: after countless tryouts of various plasma and lcd tv's i decided to spend the big bucks and purchase the 46"" xbr3.i replaced a phiilips 34"" tube; its picture was really quite good on an analog signal, but with an hd signal the picture, tho better, didn't knock my socks off.after installing the xbr, i know see what all the fuss is about. to be honest with a regular analog signal my phillips picture was better...but with an hd signal the xbr brings tv watching to a new realm...it really is fantastic.we've had the set for 3 wks now, and still love it...can't wait to watch the nfl playoffs this weekend.if you're looking for a 46"" set, be sure to give this one a look. yes, it does cost a little more than some others...but in my humble opinion well worth it.",1
Great book to read to the kids: We use this book not only as a vocab learning but for number counting too. Nice pictures and the pages are solid and won't bend or break easily. We intend to use this book for our second child when she is old enough!,1
"Glad I saw them first: These looked like just what I wanted,so I went to Target to check them out.All the bad reviews you see on these trays are completely accurate. The wood was of an extremely low quality (it actually looked like it was made from an old packing crate),and the paint looked more like someone took a magic marker to the bare wood to apply the color.All I can say is they have a lot of nerve charging $37 for these,I'm glad I didn't buy them.",0
"Clean well- lit stories: Hemingway is one of the greatest of all short - story writers. There is often a poetic beauty and clarity in his language. His apparently simple Biblically cadenced sentences are perceptually precise and focused. His stories generally have themes and create in a few lines memorable characters. Think of the old man who drinks without spilling in a 'Clean Well- Lighted Place' and who recites the ""Nada y Nada' version of the ""Lord's Prayer'. Or think of Krebs the soldier who comes home from the war and whose experience has estranged him completely from the sentimentalities and cliches of his family and home life. Think of Nick Adams himself the Hemingway alter ego whose innocence meets terrible experience more than one time. Hemingway is a master of close observation , a great American classic. Enjoy.",1
"Patterns Galore: The patterns are fantastic, so many you won't be able to choose and their is a very handy index, just in case you forget what month your favorite pattern is in. I am a little disappointed with the quality of the paper, thought it should of been a little more durable.",1
"Should come in a 3 pack with "" From Paris wh Love and The losers"": I have seen some crap movies lately, but wow! This one is the worst. Thought it would be cool to see all these action stars in one film, then I quickely realized none of them can act. I left the movie theatre 3/4 of the way through the movie, just staying that long was hard. If you can listen to a never ending series of one liners, a beyond retarded plot and horrible cg this is your movie. I like to think my one star is for the return of Dolph and the drinking game you could prob make out of the one liners.",0
Too many commercials: I purchased this movie as a gift for someone who mentioned she had been looking for this movie for a long time. Unfortunately she said the movie had so many commercials and she was annoyed by that. Let the buyer beware! I also purchased the disc set for her and she had the same complaint. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. Let the giver beware!,0
"Why change perfection?: The Sherman brothers (who wrote all of the songs for the film)are still alive. As a matter of fact, in the 1990's they even wrote a new musical with outstanding music (""Busker Alley"" starring Tommy Tune). Why, then, were they not asked to provide music for the show? The additional songs written by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe are jarringly different in style from what the Shermans wrote and are inferior and distracting. Actually, why add new songs at all? Why deviate from the film at all?! The movie was nearly perfect winning Julie Andrews an Oscar and Oscars for the Shermans as well. If they needed to expand the length, they could have expanded on the existing plot lines in the film... they didn't have to add the dark scenes used in the musical version.On the whole, the disc was a dissapointing listening experience.",0
"Look at the Review Below: For any true punk fans: please read the review directly below mine. I mean no disrespect to the people who enjoy pop, but Blink 182 should not be pop; they are a punk band. The review below just proves who their current fans are. They have sunk to a new low in my mind. At first Enema didn't seem so bad, but the more of it I hear and the more I see the videos, the more I find myself angry. Blink 182 has lost its edge and gone trendy. To me, they are dead. R.I.P.",0

"ok.: poor story line. a little comedy here and there, but with not much quallity inbetween. my kids ages 8-14 thought it was ok, the younger ones were almost as bored as I was. My two boys found more humor in it than the rest of us, they are 14 and 13.",0
"Utter Trash: I was scared as soon as the disk started with a goof ball in a bad tux, sitting in a dimly lit room, introduced the making of Grand Prix. The quality of the introductory shots must have been done on a 1980's vintage VHS hand held. The film, as said in earlier reviews, is maybe 15 minutes long, and must have been done as a theater promotion, or as something shone on the old CBS Friday Night Movies used to show as filler in the 1960's. I can give you the accurate time, because I have not looked at the disk again due to embarrassment. What makes it worse is that I have been waiting for three months (as of late December 03') for the widescreen VHS version; sense there is no DVD available. Save your time and money!",0
"Classy Case: The Canon G7+G9 are presented as classy, yet modern, digital interpretations of upsdale 35mm rangefinfers from the 60s and 70s. This case is the perfect complement to them. Beautifully crafted from soft leather, they snuggly cradle these exceptional cameras in the quality and style enjoyed by their Canon, Nikon, and Leica predecessors.",1
"Dangerous Machines: Both the Jones and the Smith Machines are very dangerous pieces of equipment that give a false sense of security to those who lift in a commercial gym. You're much better off lifting free weights rather than using a machine that can trap you, fix your position, and injure your back and knees because of the unnatural movement patterns. A kid in Ohio was nearly killed the other day doing a decline press on a Jones Machine without a spotter.",0
Nice quality low cost add on: Surprised at quality for the money. Very happy with Bosch saw and this makes it more useful. Cost makes it a no brainer.,1
"Very cool remote: I bought this remote to replace a Sony universal that I thought was good but this one is much better. My Sony was also programmable but you had to teach it almost every remote function. This Logitech didn't need to be taught a thing. Just entered the model of the device and it already knew what to do! The Sony had a big LCD with programmable buttons, but you had to look at it to use them becuase you could not feel the buttons. This Logitech has a much smaller LCD but you can feel the buttons so you do not have to look away from the TV to work it. The internal battery scares me a little, but so far so good, I only have to charge it about once every 2 weeks. We will see if that lasts.",1
"Only For A Select Few: I'm a Star Wars fan but I didn't care for this so I can't even say this is for die hard fans. Maybe it's for die hard fans who would like to throw their money away. I found the plot on this very thin with most of the pages devoted to action. The story includes some characters who are ""new"" in the comics but includes some older ones like Bib Fortuna and Wedge Antilles who appeared to act just like any other character. The art was passable but I found the story and writing very lacking. If you want a really good Star Wars graphic novel I would suggest getting Dark Empire.",0
"One of my favorite shows.: The reason I like this show so much is all the history I learn. If it weren't for this show, I'd have never heard of half the stuff they talk about. Mike and Frank are great together, and they have been picking for 20+ years. This is one of my favorite shows on TV.",1
"Brutal and Heartbreaking: Stewart skillfully conveys the daily life of a war correspondent, from the bananlity of balancing budgets and managing staffers to the horrors of covering bloody battles where rebel gunmen fight with a sickening barbarism. The author's tone is that of a young, ambitious journalist who uses his writing to give a voice to those who have none, and in the process is seriously injured in a Sierra Leon ambush.Stewart survives the hellish ordeal of simply getting to a hospital after he is shot. Then he's given only a 20% chance of living. His deep compassion for people ravaged by war, coupled with his own physical and emotional struggle to survive, is truly inspirational.",1
Save your money buy the single: Great movie but the cost of the extras was not worth it. I only watch the original version and the other DVDs rest in their cases collecting dust. The movie rocks.,1
"Can't hang this rack: There are three points at which this is supposed to attach to the wall. The instructions say all three need to go into studs, but the points are only about 6 inches apart. It specifically says to not use any other type of fastener, that it must go into a stud but then says to ask your hardware store if you need special hardware. It is ridiculous and unusable.",0
Not Impressed: I was really excited about receiving these earphones because of all the reviews. And because I was interested in the J-Buds and seen these were much cheaper with lots of good reviews. These earphones are not the ones for me. I have small ears and the earphones won't stay in my ears. Not matter what I do they constantly fall out. So in my opinion if you have small ears these earphones are not for you.,0
"Homophobic drivel: Wow. I bought this book for 50 cents at the library thinking I might find some insight to help me with my toddler. Instead, I quickly saw that Jean Lush is a homophobic ""Christian"" looking to proselytize. Nothing on the front or back covers would indicate her insane views conveyed within. Now I don't want this book in my home, but I don't want to donate it so some other person sees it. I'm considering burning it...composting may be safer. Avoid this book!! I like the website Aha! Parenting for advice.",0
"I was raised on Sam Cooke ...: God rest my Dad's soul! He brought us up on all the greats, but Sam Cooke has been my all-time favorite since I was a toddler. My brother reminded me a few days ago that we were not brought up on lullabys. We were brought up listening to Sam Cooke, and to this day I still hear my Dad whenever I hear Sam Cooke. It's like the two are one -- there was no looking at my Dad without seeing his love for Sam Cooke. And there is no listening to Sam Cooke -- even to this day -- without remembering my Dad.There have been great voices since Sam Cooke, but none will ever be equal to him. God gave him a gift that is absolutely timeless. He was smooth and he was gorgeous and his voice will never grow old.",1
"Great book: I was in Vietnam with the 9th Inf Div Pathfinder Det (13 Pathfinders for the entire division) and the 1st Bde 101st. I knew about half of the people that were with Rich Burns at the time, but don't remember meeting him. I can vouch for his accuracy of a lot of what happened during that period of the war.I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about what we did. There is a US Army Pathfinder Association that is trying hard to gather more information from those of us that did this job. It's located at www.USPathfinders.org. For those interested, There is a history section that might be helpful.",1
Dont waste your money: Dont waste your money. If this isnt your very first book on business startup then it is a complete waste of money. You could do this good with 10 minutes of free research on the net.,0
"most disappointing of the series: This is the weakest of the six books I have read in the series. The translation into English is flat and the language drab. Usually, the element of mystery and suspense is stronger as is the character development of the detective Kurt Wallender and those surrounding his life. Here, the mystery lacks tension and at the end I hardly cared about the resolution. Also, there was little depth in the portrayal of Wallender or his personal circumstances. If you want to read two first rate Wallender mysteries, choose either One Step Behind or Sidetracked [they are quite similar in plot --and both are extraordinary mysteries].",0
"A classic in every sense of the word: This book is not only beautifully photographed, it is also beautifully written and thoroughly researched as well. Beautiful houses are featured, along with great furniture. The book contains the history of each house, their designers and how the present owners came about collecting their furniture and accessories. Most of the important Fifties designers are featured - Nelson, Eames, Jacobsen, Heywood-Wakefield, Bertoia, Saarinen, Noguchi, just to name a few. There is a list of retail outlets, manufacturers and distributors at the back of the book that those of us hoping to acquire some of the furniture featured in the book will find useful. This book is a thoroughly enjoyable read and a feast for the eyes, and is definitely worth every cent you spend on it, and more.",1

"It's going to get better, it's going to....: I'll give these guys credit for hiring a good promo company to do the trailer. It actually looked funny in the promo. I got a used copy for $2.50(should have been a sign) and watched 5 minutes of this terrible non-funnyness telling myself it will get better. At 10 minutes, I said it again. At the 15 minute mark, I took it out of the player and tossed into the pile of crap movies I give away to people I don't like that well.",0
"Better than aqua-clear: I got two of these to replace two aqua clear 110's for my 55gallon tank. My water was always cloudy with the aqua's but only a day of using these the water is 10x better. I like the filter pads better as well. This is only one so its easier to maintain and clean than having three. The wheels spin well on all of them as well. It can be noisey but you just gotta add/decrease the water level to make it stop. Overall a great product, will never go back to aqua's.",1
Can't get these off my daughter: These are the perfect school shoes for my 8 year-old daughter. She wears them on the weekends as well. The soles are very soft and flexible. True to size and very cute.,1
"Don't waste your money, this book is very out of date.: Don't waste your money on this book. Even though it says 2006, it is very out of date. Using this guide really messed up our planning for our Universal Studios visit. There is a lot of information here that is pure and simple WRONG. This is most especially true about Express Pass which is now a huge ripoff. The free guide you get at the gate is really all you need. By the way, I thought Universal Studios sucked except for a few movie theme rides like Jurassic Park. My kids, however, loved the rollar coasters. I should have stayed home, not bought the book, and gone to Six Flags. I would have saved a lot of money.Give me Birnbaum and Disney World anyday.",0

"Best Band of the Year!: I'm just gonna review the songs here...Let's Go: 4/5 Not Bad for an intro. but should have kept beginning part of it instead.Ces't La Vie: 5/5 Nothing wrong with this song.

Don't ask me why.To You I Belong: 4.5/5 Sweet, but doesn't have that final zest to it.Rollercoaster: 5/5 Reminds me of DisneyWorld but I really like it. Second place.We Four Girls: 3/5 Just doesn't work out.Castles In the Air: 5/5 Ties for first. This is my favorite though, it has the zest that To You I Belong doesn't have. The solo: So softly like a sigh Sea where the white horses ride It all seemed so real A feeling deep inside So our time will go onFreak Out: 3/5 Not that good.Like The Rose: 4.5/5 Kinda like To You I Belong, but good.Never Giving Up: 4/5 The better version of Rev It Up.Oh Mr. Postman: 5/5 Good finale. Though they should have taken out the male vocals at the end.",1

"Guilty or innocent?: The book ""Monster"" is written by Walter Dean Myers it is about the 16 years old Steve Harmon, who is on trial for robbery and murder.On trial Steve and Mrs O'Brien try to convince the juror that he is innocent. In my opinion this book is boring , because it has not suspense.The most part of the story takes place on trial. Ihave just read this book because we must readed at school for our Klausur. The reader does not get enough information about steves character.The diary from steve harmon is absurd because we does not get the information if he is guilty or innocent.",0

"Too huge to use: I was looking forward to these, as traditional earbuds fall out of my ears with the slightest jostle or bump. I couldn't figure out how something this big is supposed to fit into a space the size of an ear opening. They are 1""x3/4"" big. I passed this around at work and nobody else could figure out how to make them fit, either.Maybe that's why the only picture of them actually IN an ear is a drawn one.",0

"Declining quality: I purchased one of the Creative MuVo TX FM 1GB units about two years ago and spent hundreds of hours listening to books on tape and downloaded lectures on it. I loved this thing and when the jog wheel/switch finally gave out, I ordered its successor, the MuVo V100 2GB player. What a difference - they've cheapened the quality of the plastic so that the whole device flexes. I don't care to see light through the gaps in an electric device. I couldn't believe that this unit would last as long as the previous device, so I immediately returned it and ordered another MuVo TX FM. I'm not sure how much longer this older unit will be around, so I may have to order a second as a spare. BTW all of these units have the same multifunction jog wheel/push button switch and it is their one great weak point. Too much stess is put on that one critical piece.",0
"Ridiculous: This is an absurd adventure into the supposed Darcy bedroom. As others say, nothing more than dressed up porn and not very believable behavior. Gross spoilers to follow....At one point Darcy finds the dressed-up Lizzie, ready for a ball, and throws her up on a dresser and... well. And then he asks her not to bathe so she can feel it running down her legs all night. Ewww. Would Darcy ever do that???Then he brings a mirror into their bed, and our witty (not in this book) Lizzy looks at them being... in the marital way.... and says, ""It IS fascinating, isn't it?"" PUH-LEEZE. Lizzy also pouts when she realizes that this 30 some odd year old aristocrat husband of hers had other lovers, and gives him the third degree???? NOT something a respectable young wife and lady would do. IMHO.Just three examples that made me snort.Wish I had never bought this book.",0

"This guy is amazing!: They don't make them like this anymore. This album is one of the best of 1999. It easily tops new music by popular bands like Def Leppard, etc. It's great to know that people still make awesome rock music. I never heard his first album, but this one (his second) was recommended by a friend and i'm very glad I listened to him. When's the next one coming?",1
"Excellent, informative work: This is an excellent reference for Alabama's logging railroads. Plenty of detail for each and every logging branch in Alabama, including a section for ones that may or may not have existed. Even more valuable is the detailed roster for each of these railroads. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Alabama or Southeastern railroad history.",1
"Much Better than Burton's Batman Flicks: This is the best bigscreen adaptation of a major comic superhero that I've seen, much better than the chaotic messes of Burton's Batman films (though I thought Michael Keaton was excellent as Batman). Tobey Maguire's characterization of Peter Parker/Spiderman is perfect, though I do hope he doesn't get limited to the role, since he is probably the best Hollywood male actor of the twenty-something age group.Sometimes I think Raimi still goes for too much close-up violence in that sort of goofy but sadistic cult director way (as does Peter Jackson in Lord of the Rings), but overall this is a serious action hero movie that manages to have some fun. It sticks pretty close to the Spiderman many will know from the 60s comic book, but the story and conceits have been largely updated for this century.Here's hoping Ben Affleck as Daredevil (another Marvel favorite of mine) turns out as good.",1
"Great reference: This is a great reference for anybody who is interested in 3d. It presents the material in a concise fashion, with plenty of illustrations, and without deviating from the subjects presented.

"Disappointing Performance: I've had this scale for a few years now and I've just come to expect to see a different reading each time I step on the scale. I have to take a few readings and average them. Sometimes the difference between one weighing and the next is as much as four pounds.Also, the scale supposedly has a ""fat analyzer"" feature, but I was just looking at it a moment ago, and I have no idea how to activate this feature. I can set up to 10 separate users, entering age, height, sex, and ""fit level"" for each, but there's no mechanism I see for having the scale analyze anything except my weight (which it does poorly, as I mentioned).The last straw for this scale was my recent visit to my doctor's office. They had just installed a new digital scale, and according to it, my Salter was registering 15 pounds under the actual weight. Considering that there's no obvious way to adjust this digital scale, that's just too much.",0
Another day camping destroyed by Holland Companion: Wife does cooking I was asked to get Companion out of front compartment of 5th wheel and set it up. I did and lit the burner. She comes out 20 minutes later and it is still cold. I turn off gas open lid wait several minutes. Re-lite close lid check to make sure it is lit. All OK 5 minutes later I look again and it went out. Re-lite two minutes later out again. This goes on for 45 Minutes. Wife cooks meat in oven inside RV. Now I have to stand on my head to clean RV oven. This happens all the time with this grill. Wind outside over 2 MPH and it will NOT stay lit. Even dead calm when you open the lid it goes out.DO NOT BUY this piece of JUNK.,0

"Our lives take many paths: Having been a student of the author's mother, I was very hesitant to purchase this book. It reveals an intimate side to people I have known all my life and I was not sure I wanted to enter into their emotional closets. How happy I am that I did buy the book! It only proves what we have always known about ""BeBe."" She is an extremely strong and intelligent woman and I am honored to have had her as a friend as well as a high school teacher. Read the book! It is important reading for every woman who ever thought she knew her mother inside and out. How little we really know....",1
"I must be dreaming. Please stop screaming!: I was a little kid and up late one night when the ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" TV special aired. The music videos for the creepy music on this album enthralled me, and scared the living sh*t out of me. Thirty years later, I still listen to this album frequently. The final act featuring the insane, diabolical Steven still scares me, and Cold Ethyl remains my all-time favorite song about necrophilia. ;-) Welcome to my Nightmare is twisted, evil, maniacal genius.",1
"Another religious theme sci-fi flop: I was going to give thi film a very bad review but I decide not to hurt the feeling of the idiots who made it so only giving it a bad review. If there was anything good about it it must have been during the time when I fell aleep. The story, theme, acting , photography, producing and directing must have been by a group of over zealous christian evangelists. Bits and pieces were borrowed from other sci-fi movies. I hope the people who were involved in making this movie have a second career lined up. Maybe they could get work sweeping streets for Mr. Warner. Did they really get enough money in their church collection plates to finanve this trashy movie?",0
No suppport: Got this pillow because I have chronic neck pain after 2 neck surgeries. Read reviews - so I thought I would try this. I have spent a lot of money searching for the right pillow. Very disappointed. This pillow was almost flat and offered no support - it does not cradle your neck nor support your shoulders as advertised. I was hoping this was the one. I am once again back to searching for the right pillow.,0
"very overrated: I wish this game was funner, but the story was sooo boring and the graphics so outdated, that it really was a chore to finish this game. the ending was a rip off, seriously, i played like 50 hours and this ending just sucked!!! OVERRATED!",0
"Ridiculously confusing mess: This starts out alright, but rather quickly veers into a maze of stories within stories, muddled transitions, confusing lines of plot development, what seems like the old play-within-a-play device, not to mention characters who we never develop the slightest interest in. Charlie Kaufman, the self-absorbed screenwriter who got way too much credit for movies like ""Eternal Sunshine,"" directed this and got way too ambitious. We simply don't care about the main character, Philip Seymour Hoffman playing a director, nor do we ever develop any sympathy for anyone else here. The movie tries to cover a long time period, I guess, which just ends up being another over-the-top element. In the end, I have no idea what this sprawl was about. If I want to work this hard, I would get a job. For entertainment, I would look elsewhere.",0
"Bad final service: I bought one of this machine and I brought it to Venezuela, for my surprise when I tried to used it the machine never worked.I tried to find a contact number to apply the warranty in Venezuela in the Kitchen Aid website and by my dissapoint there are not contact number for warranty.",0

"Absolute Garbage - Fell Off and Lost in Minutes: I'll start off by saying that I'm a huge advocate for screen protectors, and have installed and used them for years on my phones, GPSs and cameras. This one is the absolute worst I've ever used. I put it on the camera last night, let it sit overnight, and used it today for the first time. Within an hour I looked down and noticed it was GONE. Apparently the adhesive wasn't strong enough to hold it to the camera screen. Unacceptable and a total waste of money. Prior to it falling off, my observations were: 1) It's not particularly clear, and made the screen look almost sparkly, and 2) It had a lousy fit, with exposing the screen on all four sides. Save your money. I'm going to see if Zagg makes an Invisible Shield for this camera--that's what I have on my iPhone and after two years there's not a single scratch or blemish on it.",0
"Not Just Another Road Book: A journey of self discovery, as well as a journey exploring recent North American changes in Spring, this book is literate and erudite. As noted in comments above, it contains small factual errors, (analagous to claiming Martin Van Burean was the 12th President), but these do not detract from the over-all quality of nor the message of the book.I heartily recommend it to those interested in journies of self discovery as well as those concerned about global warming's effects.",1
"Good for the money: I received a thousand free biscuits with the purchase of my plate joiner. I've found that maybe 3% of the #20 biscuits are too thick to fit in the slot, and some have rough edges which make insertion kind of tricky when matching up large panels. But generally they work as advertised, and I'm really sold on biscuit joinery.",1
"Robert Randolph is great!: I bought this for my husband. We saw Robert Randolph on Austin City Limits a few years ago and loved him. Then we saw them in Little Rock at Riverfest two years ago.

"Absolutely Awful: The structure of this book was absolutely awful. The content even worse. This book has no clear storyline and jumps around uninspiringly. The army-business connection wouldn't convince a 1st grader. In summary, this book offers nothing of value.",0
"Breathtaking collection of moon/Project Apollo photos: This is a gorgeous collection of photographs celebrating the Apollo missions to the moon. The photos are huge, rendered in beautiful detail, and are marvelously selected to provide almost the experience of going and being there. Some almost cheat a little bit: larger and larger photos of the moon to indicate the trip there, and likewise with the earth on the trip back. The photos from the moonwalks are wonderful, though, and frequently ones I've never seen before (which is saying something). You can see each footprint and rover track. This is a book I'll be perusing again and again.",1
"Fantastic Sound at a Great Price: I've been through two Bose Soundocks (Bose SoundDock digital music system for iPod (White)) and both broke down in approximately a year due to a design flaw in the iPod cradle (repeated inserting of the iPod eventually breaks the connection to the speakers). So I decided to save $100 and try the Klipsch iGroove since it was designed with a more robust cradle. To my great delight, the sound is MUCH better than the Soundock and I'll never go back to a Bose system!",1
"Very reliable if used properly: This and a Swedish Firesteel are my primary fire tools and have been for the last several years. As long as you patiently create a nice pile of magnesium shavings and strike the flint properly, it is very reliable and you can ignite just about any type of tinder. If you are in a wet climate, I'd recommend this over the Firesteel. Unless you are constantly dealing with wet tinder, you'll find the Swedish Firesteel quicker/easier to use (hotter sparks, as well as greater volume of sparks on the Swedish). I recommend carrying both, as well as a cheap BIC lighter.",1
god awful: I am a big Metallica fan and this is their WORST album ever! I felt the music was all over the place never getting a steady rythem it was like they could'nt keep the tempo. I felt the singing was bad almost like James was trying too hard.I know they were going through some stuff but I felt it did not come out in the music. The lyrics were good but the way it came out was agonizing to listen to. I did see the documentary and could see why they did this album but I still could not come to like it. It is torture to listen to. I finally turned it in at a record store for something else. I really liked the Black album and everything before and wish they could return to thier roots. It OK to mature but this really bites the big one.One more thing is that I cannot believe how they dissed jason. He put alot into that band and he deserves better.Tina,0
"Cheaply Made: I bought the large and small messenger bags to use for my first child. He is 4 months old and I am now looking for a different set. The large bag is too large for everyday use so I only use it for traveling. The small bag I have used since he was born and am VERY disappointed. When he was three weeks old the zipper on the top broke and I had to return it to Babies R Us. I gave the bag the benefit of the doubt and got another one. Now the fabric on the front pocket has ripped away from the bag, the bottle holders on the inside are coming loose, and the mesh pockets on the side (which I don't even use b/c I use the AVENT bottles and they don't fit in them) is coming apart also. If you are expecting this bag to last for a long time...DON'T!!!",0
"Seduction Cinema is losing it...: This one involved the rather clever idea of replacing the normal Zorro with a beautiful female (named Zorrita), which could have been very entertaining. The casting is very good, too. But it's all downhill from there. The writing is dull, and the attempt at including a girl-girl scene between Zorrita and the lady of the manor was just plain weak. Seduction Cinema used to be hot, but everything they churn out lately is lame and uninteresting. I'd rate this one another disappointing failure from a once promising production house.",0
"I read the book before I saw the movie...: ...and I couldn't put it down.They tell you on the dust cover that it's a memoir of one man's journey from homelessness to prosperity. But it's a page-turner, how he got to that point of beginning. Chris Gardner bares it all, and had me crying and laughing out loud all on the same page.It's an amazing rag-to-riches story of determination and focus to overcome all odds.",1

Once I started on the kitchen floor, I didn't stop until I did all three carpeted rooms. in about 20 minutes. It looked like I had just vacuumed. Then took it over my daughter in-laws house to show it to her. Immediately after seeing it used she said I want one. That is why I am here now . to order one for her.

"Mr. 3000: Fun and lots of hits: Record breaking achievements in baseball are what can make a career great. But what happens if that record was miscalculated? Mr. 3000 is a humorous story of an at times selfish baseball player, who discovers that he is actually short of the record, and has to make a comeback. It is through reconnecting with the game that Mr. 3000 sees some of the errors of his past ways, which provides for a fun and entertaining last gasp effort to truly be Mr. 3000.Nicholas R.W.

So, I thought I'd find out what music is topping the Amazon charts here in San Diego. That's how I got here--because this collection of junk is #1! There seems to be a never-ending exodus of folks from everywhere else coming to live here in San Diego. They think that it is paradise. But be warned! We have plenty of trailer trash, single-digit IQ, horizontal family tree, knuckle-dragging, ignorant rednecks, too--as this cd's popularity here shows. So stay home.",0
"Please, don't waste 5 hours of your short life on this film: This movie was a huge disappointment. The acting was abysmal, the story developed silly themes that were irrelavent in the book, the costumes were laughable, and the sets and special effects were hit and miss. I suggest any Dune fans forget that this mini-series was created. In sum, this was one of the worst viewing experiences I can remember.",0
"""I've come to pray for Jim."": Based on the true life story of Depression Era boxer, James Braddock, Cinderella starring Russell Crowe as Braddock is a heartfelt and stunning achievment in cinematic history. Renee Zellweger plays Mae, Jim's wife, who stands by him no matter what. In the beginning, the couple and their three small children are happy, healthy, and rich but then the Great Depression strikes, their world is turned upside down. They are forced to live in a tiny apartment, they power is turned off, and one of their children is taken ill by lack of nutrition. The only reason I can't give this film 5 stars is that Cinderella Man can be slow at times, some of the boxing scenes are kind of boring but if you are a guy, of course you'll love those scenes, but overall, the film is classy, enchanting, and inspiring. Crowe and Zellweger are perfection together. Too bad this film wasn't recognized by the Academy, rent or buy this film today.",1

"No Exotic Chair Dancing here: I was very disappointed with this DVD. Hip rolls and eye contact was the main focus of their instruction. With the titles of ""Master Instructors"" I was anticipating a more moves, instructions and routines. This was more of an instruction video for someone never exposed to chair or exotic moves. I would not recommend this video to anyone.",0
"Great and unusual: Rather than re-cap what others have said, I will add a new insight. This book required full attention while reading. I found the post-Fall center section the most difficult because of the dialect. I had to slow down and mentally ""speak"" the words and sentences in my mind. The dialect is very lyrical and there was unique reading pleasure associated with this part of the book. This is a book that is NOT a quick read but the rewards are worth the time invested.",1

"Best I've Used: This product, Endust for Electronics, is the best I've found for a variety of computer related cleaning tasks. Not only does it work well on monitor and laptop screens, it also works well on optical media. Using this product, I'm able to play scratched DVD's that otherwise I would not be able to view.Unfortunately, the 4 oz. pump version has become very difficult to find. I prefer pump type sprayers because I find it much easier to control the amount of liquid being applied. Their smaller size is also a bonus.",1
"Inconsistency Dooms Stepfather 3: A poor script as well as an over use of blood hamper what little hope given to this film from Robert Wrightman's 50/50 performance. The film suffers from inconsistency: meaning that the good parts, like the beginning, are good and do get your hopes up, but you will only have them crushed moments later bad some bad blood effects or unfitting dialouge. It had the potential, and Wrightman gave a decent attempt at the stepfather character, but the supporting cast and writing simply aren't up to the task.",0
excellent: This was a Christmas gift for my niece. I read another book in this series and enjoyed it.,1

"Arrrrrrgggggghhhhh! - One Lifelong Rush Fan's review: Let's get this painful writing out of the way.I have been listening to Rush for 25 years and count myself as a dedicated fan of most of what they've produced.S&A; is terrible.Read the 1 star and 2 star reviews for the reasons, as they are numerous.The one facet that hit me between the eyes from the first listening is the complete breakdown of their song-making methodology. It reminds me of a Rockline interview Geddy gave back in the late '80s. When asked how the ""Music by Lee & Lifeson. Lyrics by Peart"" thing worked, Geddy commented that, although complex, Neil's writing rarely left him ""with a mouth full of words I can't sing"" (paraphrased).From start to finish, Geddy sounds like he has a mouthful of words that are not only un-sing-able, but are lacking in the creative insight which has been one of Rush's halmarks. Really, really terrible, and SAD to boot.Is this the end of the road???",0
"These Pieces of Pie Taste Like Crap!!!: Seriously, these suck sooo bad that they are not even American Pie movies! These are just cheap rip-offs to cash-in on a franchise. They are just the same plot about going to college, getting laid, getting drunk, etc. The only thing they do to make it like the originals is get Eugene Levy to be Jim's dad for a 5 minute cameo. I would not recommend AMERICAN PIE PRESENTS: THE TRIPLE PACK!!!",0
Amazingly funny!!!!: Absolutely historical. I f you can not see the humor and wit in this movie then you should truly check to see if you still have a pulse. I cried from laughter! It was funny from start to finish!!!!!,1
"streaming is hit or miss.: I was forced to watch half of the episodes in poor quality SD. This is not fault of my internet provider as I receive around 20mbps at all times. Also, none of the other streaming services have any trouble (like Netfix and VUDU) as I receive full HD from both without any issues. There is definitely something wrong with the Amazon Instant PS3 interface.Aside from that, the show is great.",0

"Won't play without memory card- and an editing error: As many reviews have already pointed out, this U.S. region 1(A) blu-ray will not play without the addition of an SD memory card. Criminal that Sony did not recall this problem disc. I contacted Sony Home Entertainment, and was offered an exchange. Send in my new disc with all the packaging, and receive a new disc with all the packaging. The let down occured when the customer service person could not tell me the replacement disc would play without additional external memory, or even that the editing problem (reported to be during the outpost battle scene) has been fixed. I for one do not have a memory card lying around that I can insert into my player just to watch this movie. Time to punt. Amazon was super about accepting my opened item return for credit.Now for the solution:Purchased the UK version blu-ray (region free) for an excellent price on amazon.co.uk. Plays great. No editing problem. Great movie to own on blu-ray. Extremely happy.",0
"Had higher expectations: Just used this for one week on vacation. Given the large size for a travel razor, and double foil, I expected a better shave.Will NOT trim any long hairs. I really wanted this to be a great purchase, but at least the price was low. I have a $2 tiny single foil that runs off a AAA battery that does as good of a job as this, but takes longer.",0
"Not as great as previous albums: I agree with the other two reviews. this album isn't up to par with previous albums. Changing the sound was a big mistake. It broke my heart when I heard the first couple of songs their voices sound better without this new rock sound its way too edgy. This is your land is wonderful and if the album had more songs on it like that one I would have given this album 5 stars.with their other albums after they would first come out I wouldn't stop playing it for weeks and end up buying more copies of them because they would actually wear out. I loved the former member Terry and when she left the group i was a little sad but decided to give the new one a chance. She is wonderful and is doing a great job.I agree with Melissa:This is YOUR land"" - absolutely beautiful, with harmonies and a rich love and meaning conveyed. Other songs fell flat.If its not broke don't fix it",0
"How can you use After effect without having that book?: This book is truly amazing. It gives you useful information on every single page. It is meant for people who really want to get serious with After effect. After reading only a couple of chapters, I was already doing great stuff on my computer. It comes with a demo version of AE 4.1 so you can do the tutorials.If you want to discover the real power of AE, then get that book.",1

"In my top 5 books of all time: This book is the most practical book for deepening spiritual awareness I've come upon. In short chapters, very powerful teachings are shared. In each chapter nsightful questions are asked for the reader to introspect and journal. Affirmations and suggestions for practicing each lesson is given. I teach at a seminary and use this book in all of my classes and workshops. I have used this book for small home study groups. Without exception, my students, counselees, and others to whom I've recommended this book have found it very powerful. Regardless of one's faith background, this book is a consciousness awakener. I have used the ""collapse process"" and have attended some of Dr. Demartini's workshops. I am profoundly influenced by this powerful work. If we all lived by the awarenesses and practices delineated in this book, we would be so filled with gratitude moment to moment that we would establish peace on earth.",1

"My favorite Christmas CD: I absolutely love this CD and have been playing it every chance I can. This is what Christmas music should be: holy, reverent, joyous, and celebratory. My favorite song is The Appointed Time, due to the medieval flavor, although you really haven't heard We Three Kings until you've heard this version. John Michael Talbot's guitar playing is outstanding as always. I plan on giving this as a Christmas gift to some dear friends. This music will bless you and draw you into the true spirit and meaning of Christmas.",1
"IT WAS SOOOO BAD: I had just finished reading ""Gone with the Wind"" and I was absolutely in love with it. Then i read ""Scarlett"" and suddenly.... Before, Scarlett O'Hara had stood for the south and how much it meant to her. Suddenly, she goes off to Ireland and hates America! And Rhett, who left her because he lost all passion he had, comes back because she keeps drawing him in or something. Thats not what should happen. And her and Rhett have another kid! And Scarlett likes it for once! Plus, she gives up her corset and fancy dresses for black peasant clothes, gives up her home in Atlanta for a shack in Ireland. It was terrible. Everything Scarlett ever stood for in gone and the whole story is changed around into a bad romance that I secretly suspect thats how Alexandra Ripley meant it to be. It did not deserve to be the sequel to the greatest book ever written. it doesnt even deserve a spot in your supermarket checkout line.",0
"Pretty awesome for a non-ballast HID light!: After having tons of trouble with the delivery (from the unknown clowns of ""A-1""), it was finally time to put these things in.

"Wonderful Book - Great Ideas: This is a must have book if you're into creative projects with glass. The author gives great ideas with projects that are easy to follow. Of course, it helps to have taken courses in stained glass and glass fusing. The first box I made was based on the ideas from this book. I would definitely recommend this book for your craft library.",1
"read this book: A very important book. I agree that some issues were overlooked, but I think that for a simple manifesto format they covered the important basics.",1
"A chore.: This book was a chore to get through. I've read a handful of Trek novels, and this is my least favorite by far. It was dry, boring and difficult to get through. The novel had no structure of any kind (no build up and no climax) and the ""suprise ending"" was pretty lame. I found a lot of the characters saying and doing things they normally wouldn't do. I know that Duane is no stranger to the Trek franchise, but if I didn't know better I would assume that she didn't know these characters at all.",0

This film was not VIOLENT. It was WEAK and needed a kick up the bum bum!nothing special at all...stick to American prison films, they're much grimier n have better storylines.",0
"Worth watching: We did not read the book, so I cannot compare it with that. We did really enjoy the movie, although I found the ""critters"" that they used at the end in the climax to be a bit cheesy. I have been told that if they had attempted to use them as written in the book it would have been even more cheesy, so I'm glad they changed it. I have definitely recommended it to friends as a really interesting story idea that was well-acted and fun to watch.",1
"quintessential ozzy-bath: if you want an ozzy sabbath collection without any filler, this is the one to get. it is simply the cream of black sabbath during the ozzy period. every song is a killer - but i think you already know that. if you want a more extensive collection with detailed notes, photos etc look elsewhere. for me this works! i first had this on tape 15 years back and was lucky to get this on cd as well. at its price you can't get a better deal!",1
"R.L.Stine at his greatest!: This and Camp Nowhere are definitely the best books in the Nightmare Room series thus far.

"One great recipe after another!: You will love this book. The writing is hilarious, and the recipes are divine. Everything I've tried from this book, I've loved.Some of the recipes are really surprising, but you learn quickly to trust Isa's culinary skill. I never would have imagined vegan gravy made with chickpeas (not usually found on my personal hit parade of favorite ingredients) would be absolutely the best gravy I've ever tasted. But it is! Now I scout grocery stores for chickpeas on sale.The vegan pancakes really rock, too. They're simple to make, and actually turn out better than any of my other pancake recipes.",1
"Sorely Disappointed: I have been a fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta for a long time, and was just dying for something new! I couldn't possibly have been more diappointed. All the classic mistakes, she would start going in an intersting direction then plod on to something that was out in left field and not even pertinent. I knew it was useless when I had 20 pages left and the story had more unanswered questions than answered ones...and I didn't care. She rushed the ending, seriously wrapping up one of the most interesting pieces of the story in one and a half pages, possibly trying to make it a cliff hanger, but definitely missing the mark. I had no interest or caring for any of the main characters or what was happening to them, and Scarpetta was a washed out bland, version of herself. Patricia Cornwell's style of writing is still as good as ever, but this book lacked substance and is well beneath her ability. I agree with the other review, I wish I could get my $22 back and read the paperback.",0
Don't waste your precious reading time: a very long book with little point and a highly disappointing ending. main character sucks. so sad for Tom Wolfe.,0
"PERRY BEFORE THE LP ERA: As usual with that collection,you've got your money's worth.Most early hits are collected here, plus many wonderful versions of famous songs like LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME(one of the most recorded songs in history)and IF I LOVED YOU from CAROUSEL and BODY AND SOUL.You'll notice that PERRY sings the lyrics clearly;you absolutely hear every word of each song.While THE VERY BEST OF remains the best buy if you want only one cd of him,this is certainly not a waste of your money.If your a fan,you'll like this collection to stand alongside the ones of FRANK's COLUMBIA records and also DICK HAYMES,probably the best crooner of the time.Mister COMO had class,and if he recorded dubious novelty songs once in a while,only RCA should be blamed.",1

Being a college student, there are lots of religious people around who like to bother passing students with ""the words of christ"" and what-not. I figured I could get my point across by slapping this baby to the rear window of my jeep.After leaving a lecture, I began walking towards my car to find someone trying to remove my little darwin fish from my car! I was able to ward him off with a swift kick to the ass, and also found that the jerk was unable to budge my little darwin emblem :)This emblem is rock solid if placed correctly, and can withstand rain, snow, heat, and even wussie theists!",1
"Not so great: I was just starting out as a sewer so I got this machine becasue it ""appeared"" to do a lot for the money. It is ok as far how it works its nice to have the all the stitches but it is very load sounds like it is breaking (in fact I thougth it was and it was just a bad machine until I heard that is common with brothers) it also DOES NOT EMBROIDERY... do not believe that. also you cant really go past med speed or it starts acting up. look else were because in 6 months you will be better then the machine can do.",0
Bosch O2 sensor: I replaced my O2 sensor on my 03Ford F250 about 1500 miles ago with this Bosch one and so far so good. And Amazons price was better than anywhere else.,1
"A different bit of suspense: I usually enjoy any Bruce Willis film, as he is indeed a very talented actor. I thought this was going to be just another action film, but the story line was a new twist and the movie holds your interest well. Alec Baldwin is a sincerely menacing meanie - cold hearted to the core. Only Alan Rickman could have played it crueler. A good addition to my collection, and I am sure I will repeat viewing from time to time.",1
"Another winner from one of my favorite authors!: Diane Gaston, aka Diane Perkins, has done it again in ""A Reputable Rake"" - a novel nominated for the coveted RWA RITA Award for 2006. It's easy to see why, for ""A Reputable Rake"" is an outstanding, exciting tale of respectability and the dark side of England's ton life. The characters are enchanting, vividly alive and the story is intriguing, filled with danger and excitement that will keep the reader turning the pages. I literally could not put down this book until I reached the last page, and even then, I wanted more. An excellent, highly enjoyable read I'd recommend to all.",1
"FANTASTIC: This book covers a range of spiritual questions in a way that is contemporary, thoughtful, and true. Treat yourself to this one!",1

"Junk: I got this hunk of junk for Christmas. When I first turned it on it only lasted a couple of minutes. I figured the batteries must need charging, so I charged it according to the instructions. When I tried it again, it still only lasted a couple of minutes. Replacement batteries cost almost as much as the light, so I guess this brand new light is headed for the trash. I feel bad that my daughter wasted her money on this thing. Only one good thing I can say about it, it is very bright, which doesn't do me much good with bad batteries. Buy something else for sure!!!",0
"A fantastic read for anyone who is interested in the martial arts.: I have to admit it. I have been a fan of Dave Lowrey's books and columns for many years. This book reads like a novel, even though it is more of a biography of the author's search for the real meaning of Bushido. Just as in many ancient martial art stories, this one begins with the author's quest to learn the martial arts from a Japanese couple living in his area.The journey from novice to expert in Kenjutsu (Sword art) is a long hard road, but the author makes each step an adventure in reading. In conclusion, this is a book for all serious martial artists who desires to learn the true meaning of Budo.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Samurai Aerobics Official Manual).",1
"Mesmerizing tour de force!: This book is so beautifully written it is to be savored over time, like fine wine. It moved me deeply, delighted me in a literary sense, and was always a compelling joy to come home to. Alan Cambeira is a stellar writer; surely he could speak of the phone book and be just as mesmerising, but when the topic is the struggles of sugarcane business in the Dominican Republic, it is indeed a rare and wonderful feast. Brava to a sublime author and a worthy topic. This proves that Hispanic literature is one of the worthiest to read. I recommend it not just as a library piece, but also as a special gift for any friend with a soul...",1
"Nice Surprise: I had already read Linda Howard's book, originally out in 1994, (they got me with the new title and I did not read the copyright dates carefully enough!) but I was pleasantly surprised to read Allison Leigh's book One More Change. She shows great promise and I look forward to other Turnabout Island books.",1
"Didn't receive what was pictured: I was really looking forward to receiving these chocolates when I purchased them. The Mint Bliss is probably my favorite chocolate and I was looking forward to trying the Espresso Escape. Unfortunately I did not receive what I ordered. The assortment pack I received included Evening Dream, Twilight Delight and Intense Dark (which I do not like at all). You have to make sure you send people what they order.",0
"No Greyscale Printing Option: Prints nice BUT - most printers give you the option to print in greyscale to save the expensive color ink cartridge. I do this all the time when I want a temporary hardcopy of info. from a web site. The HP 1210 printer driver does not include this option. I contacted HP customer service and they confirmed. They gave me a hokey method of physically removing the color cartridge and changing the ""configuration"". I think this is HP's Marketing departments efforts to increase color cartridge sales. If you need a greyscale print option, DON'T buy this printer.",0
"Pleased overall: Like many other reviewers I was not using enough minutes to justify a monthly plan. I had been interested in Virgin Mobile's pay-as-you-go plan and was excited when they came out with their beautiful new flip phone. After buying it, I have almost no complaints. The color screen is great, the games that come with it are fun little extras, and it's very easy to use. It also comes with a world clock, scheduler, calculator, and up to three alarms you can set (so don't pay $ .25 each to buy them off virgin). The wallpapers that come with it are okay, though I am not a fan of the ringtones. Right now virgin has a promo and you can get three free ringtones off their site though, so take advantage of it while you can. The only negative thing I would say about this phone is that the coverage could be better....but as long as you don't live in the middle of nowhere you should be okay.",1
"Doesn't work! Money down the drain.: I ordered this product from an herbalife rep. , it was supposed to help me with digestion and I also bought 200 dollars worth of other pills and stuff to lose weight and none of it worked, A huge waste of money, didn't get the refund I was promised either.",0
"Let's reinforce gender differences from the start: It's great that little girls who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls. Maybe the chamber pot style toilets in the book actually exist in a spanish speaking country somewhere...maybe....",0
"Read This Book!! It is a God!!: I read this book in AP English class. At first I wasn't happy about reading a book about the Civil War, but after I got past the first couple of chapters I realized that I was going to like it. Charles Frazier is a brilliant author. He mixed an innocent Romance with a not-so-innocent war. The charcter developement was perfect. The events in the charcters lives effected the charcters personality just right. The description in this novel was beautiful. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the end.",1
"Love it, again.: This is actually the second of this model of coffee pot that I have bought. I got the first one 7 years ago when they first hit the market. I used it almost every day and finally decided to replace it. The old one still worked great, it just had a small leak in it. Not bad for 7 years old. I knew that I had to find the same model again.It is so easy to operate and to clean. It brews a great pot of coffee.I also love the program feature. I get everything ready the night before and am greeted with a fresh pot of coffee when I step out of the shower each morning.I love it!!!",1
young writers shall dream and change the world: I am a great fan of young writers and this book held my attention and I have read many other books written by adults on somewhat of the same lines and could not get as engrossed in them as I did this book. I believe we need more young men and women that choses to take their time and use it so wisely as this and not to join gangs and do drugs and sit or watch the boob tube constantly. This book was well written and a good book for all who enjoy this type of reading.,1
"Not worth the paper it was written on: Don't waste your money on this book. The first part of the book details the history and background of DoDAF which is interesting by not really pertinent. The middle of the book contains an IDEF and UML primer which again is interesting, but not really pertinent. After the primers, is a regurgitation of the DoDAF views straight from the standard. Finally the books talks about their methodology and gives an example of its use. The example is so high level that it raises more questions than it answers.In summary, just go to the web and download the DoDAF standard documents and deskbook. You will learn more from those than by reading this book.",0
"Melitta Cone Filters: For some reason, none of the local stores I usually buy these #6 filters at are carrying them any more. Plenty of other sizes are available, but no #6. I make coffee every morning before work and on weekends, sometimes in the evening as well, and usually it's a full pot. The larger filters are a must and I just hope their shortage doesn't mean they will be discontinued.",1
"Great reference source: While search engines may dish up a listing of possible sites, this book goes further to review and make it easy for you to find what you are looking for. A pretty good collection of key internet resource site addresses all in one place. And an site update feature- you can go on-line, click into the 300Bestaviation website, and see what the new address is when a site has moved.Nice for the price. Also search for the 500 best aviation web sites- a new expanded book here on Amazon.com",1
"If you're up to mp3s, stay out of it.: If you think that with a 70 minutes MD, you can have 700 mbts of a normal cd would have, forguet it. It says that it suports mp3s, not that it reads mp3s, so, it will lower the quality of the sound.Audio Cd: 320 kbtsBelow 192 kbts, you will notice the diferenceIn this MD you can transfer at 132 kbts, 66 kbts, or no compression.So, if you want to keep the quality of your sound, you have a regular MD instead of one that reads REAL mp3s.Sincerily, i'm totally frustated! If i knew this at the start, i would never buy this piece of crap...And for Sony, keep on doing dancing robots instead!",0

"Harness the incredible power of conflict.: As professional personal coach I found Gary Simmon's book both helpful and reassuring. We are raised to see conflict as a negative force. His book shows us why it is a positive element in our lives and he us gives practical advice on how to capitalize on this often unrecognized blessing. It is reassuring to know that when we are in conflict we have the opportunity to grow and change for the better and that we do this by working with the energy of the conflict rather than by ""fighting back"". I highly recommend it for all who want to harness power of conflict for their own personal growth.",1
"Wow: I'm very glad I ordered this book. It is well rounded & clinically useful. It covers all age groups, which is important as the very young children are being exposed to sports at an earlier age, and older adults as they are living longer, active lives. It also discusses multiple treatment modalities, addiction in athletes, & physiology of exercise & injury. I've recommended it to PM&R and physical therapists, as well.",1
"PLease do NOT BUY it!!!!: I did not pay attention on the negative feedbacks of this item. I regret I did not. Trust me, you will suffer from this vitamin or whatever it is. My period is late 8 days and all those eight days I have a terrible pain in my female area I cannot even hold myself without analgesics. Please, listen to my review, this medicine is not helping, it destroys the body. I do not know if I will be able to recover from this. I do not know if I got any sickness such as cancer or fibrosis, because 8 days late for the period is too much for me and this Friday I am going to the gynecologist.",0
"A must read! How liberals want to erode your rights!: The liberals will claim these incidents are rare, no they aren't! As this book shows the anti-Christian, anti-First Amendment left have considerable influence in public education. They have turned it into their own propaganda machine. So this book goes beyond the religion issue, but also the bankruptcy of our educational system. See also books like Johnson's ""Reason in the Balance"" & ""The Wedge of Truth,"" and Watkins' ""The New Absolutes.""Limbaugh's book is a must read by all Christians and all those who care about human freedoms.",1
This was a bad representation of Paganism: While I am a huge horror fan I did not like this movie. They took what is a beautiful Pagan ceremony and turned it into something ugly. I would like to just once see a movie that correctly represents what Paganism is.,0
"Pumps air when it starts: I have owned two of these compressors, using it to power tools used in our HVAC business. DeWalt bought out Emglo, which was an amazing compressor. Too bad the DeWalt isn't near the machine the Emglo was. Pros - This compressor does make a lot of air quickly. That's it. Cons - It won't start! Even on warm days, you have to ""play"" with it to get it to go, often tripping the overload or a breaker. On a cold day, it may never start until warmed, even using synthetic compressor oil. Once it goes, it will usually run for the day. Even plugged directly into a receptacle beside a panel, it won't go. It is also a noisy pump, not as noisy as some we've heard, but right up there. We won't be buying another.",0
"Rock Stars pretending to be Punks: Sounds like a bunch of tired has beens trying desperately to sound REAL. I was very disapointed when I heard this the firt time. Nothing original, just a bunch of rehashed old punk sounds with 90's main stream punk polish. ""Welcome to the End"" ... God I hope so!",0
"Definitely Worth Getting: Profit was quite possibly the best show to ever air on the Fox network (The X-Files and The Simpsons included). It was also quite possibly the best show of the Nineties. Despite this, Profit only lasted for four episodes, all aired in April 1996. I am not sure why Profit was cancelled, but it could be that it was just too starkly original, too edgy, just too dark. Jim Profit was both the protagonist and the villain of Profit. Played by Adrian Pasdar, he was as evil as they come (J. R. Ewing was an amateur compared to him...). Profit worked for a large, international company and was willing to do literally anything to rise through its ranks. Created by David Greenwalt (who later worked on Angel) and John McNamara (who had previously written episodes of Brisco County Jr.), Profit worked very well as a dark satire of corporate America. It is little wonder to me that it has maintained a cult following to this day.",1
"Classic series, inferior DVDs: The Wire is beyond doubt the greatest tv series that I have ever seen. That's not the issue. Rather, I write this review to alert fellow consumers to the fact that this set is extremely cheaply produced. It is so bad that had I not spent the money myself, I would have concluded that it is a bootleg. Which begs the question- is it a bootleg? The quality of the recording is just poor. None of the DVDs play through without skipping etc. The box and other packaging is equally wanting. Again excellent content but disappointing box set.",0
"Why Is Does Not Work Well?: I finally figured out why it does not work well with all iphones. My iphone has a protection jacket around it. With the jacket the opening slot to charge works well with the apple iphone charger because it is thin so it can just slide in; while the Belkin covering is thicker so the metal connection cannot make it all the way in, so it cannot click and stay solidly connected. So beware",0
"This is NOT a LOUD Bad Boy: The original equipment on my truck is twice as loud as this Bad Boy. I am very disappointed in this product. It is not nearly as loud as expected. I will probably end up throwing it in the junk pile and buying something louder!! We need a loud horn as we are towing a 5th wheel trailer. I had hoped that this would be the one, but it surely isn't!",0
"Disappointing: I'm a big Doors fan & collector and was very disappointed with this documentary. In fact, there was very little I liked about it, other than perhaps the nice quality of the HWY clips and some others. There's virtually nothing new in the ""rare"" clips used, which the director was hyped as given ""access to the Doors archives"".The narrative was laughable at times and missed so much. As mentioned in another review, there were so many other people that should have interviewed for this film, who could have offered some real insight into the band and their activities at the time.Rating: 2/5",0
"Water tastes bad: Received package today, set it up water came out fast and had a rubbery chemical smell. Let it run for a few gallons, tastes bad has chemical smell like rubber. Opened the filter to make sure it was seated properly, rubber gaskets have a strong smell. I'm very disappointed with this filter, it maybe the media is no good so I'm going to get a replacement filter from another company. I guess when you buy cheap you get cheap.",0

"Brilliant show! Michael C. Hall is a real talent.: I was a big Six Feet Under fan and was anxious to see what Michael C. Hall's next project was going to be. Dexter is a fitting follow up to showcase Hall's brilliant acting skills. He manages to make the impossible possible by giving a serial killer likable qualities that create a sympathy for his ""hobby."" We've all seen the worst of the worst escape justice and hoped they would get theirs in the end. Dexter feeds that dark place that wishes the guilty who are acquitted get what's coming to them. The ice truck killer plot was just mind blowing and I didn't see the ending coming. This series is amazing and would be a killer addition to your DVD collection. (Insert collective groan...sorry!)",1

"A Creation of Love: Upon opening the CD-ROM, An American Song Album, I was struck with the multi-dimensional aspect of this very creative, informative and personal project. Because I had heard Edward and Kate perform before, I expected a high quality, professional CD, and I certainly received that and more.This is no sing along of familiar tunes with historical overlays. It is a unique collaboration of Edward's musical settings and lyrics with Kate's singing and acting skills; an intimate, interactive duet. It is not a labor of love, but a creation of love.There is also the option of just listening to the songs without the visual, historical and personal material. However, I hightly recommend watching the CD-ROM before listening...it will enhance your enjoyment enormously.",1

"Love Em': Any drummer, no matter what kind will love these sticks.I have used them everywhere from concert snare solos to marching as quad sticks. They feature a unique tip that helps for better rebound, and a white overcoat. The best thing that I can say about these sticks is that they are extremely durable!! I have had 7 or 8 pairs, and I have only broken 1 or 2 the rest just got so splintery and crappy looking that I had to replace them.If your truly into drumming, check out a pair, you will NOT be sorry!",1

"Waste of Money: This vacuum works nicely on smooth surfaces like hardwood floors or linoleum but it does absolutely nothing on carpet. I purchased it to pick up pet hair, but it doesn't even touch it. I tried to get away with purchasing a cheaper vacuume but I've learned my lesson. If you want something that picks up hair and things down in the carpet, you have to buy something with a rotating brush. This vacuum has a lot of power but without a rotating brush, it just can't get the hair out of the carpet. It is also quite a pain to use the attachments because you have to take the vacuum apart and reassemble it. It truly was a waste of money.",0
"Waiting for the price to approach reasonableness: Seriously overpriced, $44 currently for just two movies in the series? I just don't understand that. I guess they are trying to cash in at the end of the series. I will place this in my Amazon Wish List and wait for its price to be slashed when nobody purchases it at its highly inflated price.",0
"Create new structures and change your life: ""The greatest leaders and statesmen in history have not been problem solvers. They have been builders. They have been creators."" ~ Robert Fritz from ""The Path of Least Resistance""The theme of Robert Fritz' brilliant book, ""The Path of Least Resistance"" can be summed up in three words: ""Structure determines behavior.""Like you, before reading the book I had no idea what the heck that meant. Nor did I have any idea what ""structural conflict"" vs. ""structural tension"" was all about--let alone why creating structural tension is the core attribute of creative genius.As you gain an understanding of how structure determines behavior, you'll also gain a sense for why Fritz believes affirmations and willpower and all that other ""positive thinking"" stuff will never give you sustainable creative powers.For that? We need a whole new structure. And that's what Fritz great book helps us create.",1

"if you are just starting to read Carr, don't start here....: I love John Dickson Carr's wild plots and atmoshperic settings, but I simply cannot recommend this particular novel. It was written at a time when the author was suffering increasing health problems, and this is simply not up to the caliber of his ""golden age"" detective novels. This book almost struck me like an attempt by someone other than Carr, someone without his considerable talents, to immitate the type of books Carr was writing at the height of his career.If you have not read a John Dickson Carr book, start with something more substantial than this. I would recommend The Lost Gallows, or Hag's Nook, as a good starting place to become acquainted with this giant from the golden age of the puzzle story.",0

FANTASTIC ANKLE SUPPORT: I am 47 years old and wear a size 12 shoe. I ordered this ankle brace because I have stretched all the ligaments in both my ankles over many years of various sports and need support from time to time when my ankles bother me. I currently attend Tae Kwon Do classes and use the ankle braces for support during all the kicking drills. The brace is terrific. I have all the support I need and I hardly notice I have the brace on. I must point out (since I seen other mention that the support is difficult some when wearing shoes) that since I am using them in martial arts class that I wear no socks or shoes with the ankle support. I am very happy with this product and highly recommend.,1

What is should say is something to the effect of when there is a problem with either a program, hardware, or the combination, the system must be restarted to correct it.3. Does not list many important everyday items. - ex. ""Network Card"", or ""NIC"" are not listed.4. Does list old and very outdated items. - ex.

The last thing we need is another impetus for them to do so. Tongue in cheek title? Maybe so, but that's vastly outweighed by the potential harm. Remember John Lennon! Derogatis and Barricade Books ought to be ashamed of themselves.",0
"Bought for my dogs, found easy way to fill: First, filling it! I first tried using an air pump. Disaster! I then used the exhaust on my vacuum and its hose and filled it through the large hole meant to empty it. It filled VERY quickly. I also brought it to a friend's party for the kids, since she couldn't get HER pool to fill with air using a pump, and it had no other options to fill it.I reinforced the bottom by gluing a mat to the bottom. Filling all the air chamber sections was too high for the dogs, so I filled only one. It was perfect. The dogs loved it.The lower air chamber had a leak that filled the chamber with water! It made it far too heavy to move, but that was a plus since it didn't blow away on high wind days. It taught me that I could use that method for putting weight to it in the future. When the bottom air chamber became leaky, I simply moved up to the next. It lasted two years, then became junk. But, for the price, I can't complain!",1
"One Of The Best Movies I Ever Seen!: The reason i say it is the best movie i ever seen besides the godfather is.This movie covers everything we feel in life,saddness,happness,rejection ,hate and love.Yea it,s a little chezy but great music and a great story about the dells a legendary r and b group.For this price you can,t go wrong enjoy!",1
"Way to go Motorola!: This is the only cell phone I've ever owned that I didn't have a major gripe. Excellent signal strength. Good looks. Nice display. Speaker phone. What else do you want? Some people want a cell phone to walk their dog and park their car, I just want the phone to ring and be able to hear the person at the other end, the i730 does that and more. Keep the charger handy though, the battery life is shorter than most. Of course with a car charger who cares...",1

"Shock: I have read other Robin Cook books, and, without going back to re-read them, I must say I don't recall the writing being as pedestrian or the dialogue as stilted as it is in this effort. The risks taken by the two female protagonists aren't very believable, but I'll admit to being unable to put the book down as the bizarre events unfold. The ending was unsatisfying. It seemed as though the last page should have ended with ""To be continued...""",0
"Moronic; at best.: Leftover Crack is embarassing to listen to if you have a brain.Let me make it clear:Yes. Leftover Crack is anti-racist (so they say).Yes. Leftover Crack is anti-homophobic (so they say).Yes. Leftover Crack spews out most of the standard ""punk"" ideals.And yeah, that's all great and nice. But they also talk about killings cops... all the time. Since when do any sensible, ""liberal"" people condone killing??? Of anyone?I had the displeasure of seeing this horribly stupid band in concert. The drunken, mullet-headed singer mentioned in his high-pitched wicked-witch like voice that each song was basically about the same thing: cop-killing.If you have a brain, do YOURSELF the favor by avoiding this mindless garbage.",0
"WOW: wow, i dont think words can describe this book. Its a romatic comedy that will make you lagh and cry, Im 13, and this book, i can recomend to all ages. If you want to know alot more than just what the movie shows you, like i did, then you should definitly read this, it explains alot.",1
"Inadequate mounting: The LEDs are quite bright, and will last longer than either conventional incandescent or halogen bulbs. They also conserve battery power to an amazing extent.

"One of the worst film adaptations of a King novel.: El Stinko! Hammy Nicholson overshadows a story that was supposed to be about the boy. Not scary, not intelligent. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GROANER.

"You get your money's worth.(basically nothing!): This book is very inexpensive and it shows in the content. It goes through almost entirely the whole book teaching you the ultimate basics for CSS and doesn't go into teaching you to use these effects dynamically, which is ironically the title of the book. I'm going to look into DHTML by Danny Goodman. I've read his JavaScript book and it teaches everything you could possibly need.",0
Let's talk about gong fu and say nothing at all: I ordered this book to learn about the white crane system and to learn a bit about chi gong. The book has about 200 pages where the same information that can be written in 50 pages is regurgitated and only then do you get some white crane information. The pictures and sequence where hard to understand since several movements are depicted in one still and a few lines are supposed to let me know whet just happened. There is a pit of good information here but the bitter fruit that surrounds it is hard on the digestion.,0

"Just okay...: I have to be honest, I wish that I would not have bought this book. I bought it because I was under the impression that I was going to see classy cakes like the cake on the cover. When I opened the book I was confused. Page after page were pictures of sloppy cakes. There are only a few pictures out of the entire book that are worth seeing, for example Margaret Braun's cakes at the tail end of the book. Get her book before you buy this one!",0

PAGE.Until the typos get fixed, I'm keeping my review one-star.

"What a good idea!: This colourfull controller makes a great gift for anyone, it's a brilliant compromise to the more expencive controller,and is just as good looking! So why haven't i rated it 5 stars? Because although it looks good it is more compact then the bigger controllers, its quite twiddley, and takes a lot of getting used to. Another downer is the fact that you can't fit a rumble pack, or memory pack on it. Apart from that though, i think it well deserves its 4 stars. This is a definate one to put on the chrismas list!",1
"The Kindle could be so much better: The Kindle is an acceptable e-reader at best. It's real value is with the deals that Amazon is making with the publishers and the cell connectivity.I have 5 criticisms of it:1. When it is powered on, it is difficult to pick it up without turning a page; I would put the buttons along the back sides so the screen could be larger (assuming #2 below is not possible);2. The screen should be touch-enabled; it could then be full length, with a keyboard that would appear only when needed (the screen refresh time would have to be reduced to make this work well, but there is already a big latency between the key press and the appearance of a letter anyway); this would also remove the need for the the roller thing to select from menus;3. The bottom right and left corners should be rounded off so it would be more comfortable to hold;4. The power switch should be on the front;5. It really, really, really needs a hierarchical, folder-based storage system for content.",0

"Writing style is conservative, but good character study: You have to wonder about the thinking process of the man who invented Conan and Red Sonja. We find out that he lived in his head and was missing a lot of the social graces in order to fit in. This is the tortured soul artist story, but he managed to relate to Novalyne Price, a more socially accepted person. Their relationship may have pushed Howard into rethinking the role of women in his writing. Price would push back and and not let him overwhelm her. It is not a great novel, but it is insightful about someone who saw the clearly dysfunctional Howard for what he was yet still was attracted to his imaginative, if crude, mind.",1
"Works Fine: This RW is okay. I began recording CDs within minutes (after the setup).... the only problem is the size of the external drive is quite large considering they don't have to be this large anymore. This is 3 or 4 times the size of a portable CD player. Also, the software installation takes quite a long time, but nothing went wrong.And although it says it writes at 12x, i can only record at 4x.... not sure what the problem is.",1
"Essential companion to ""Fumbling"", but stands on it's own: I've always been facinated by the creative process; the steps to how artists, musicians, writers, et al, go through to create their works. So admittedly my opinion is biased just based on that. However, this album stands on it's own nearly as well. ""Elsewhere"" has a great groove to it, the loose version of ""Ice Cream"" is actually superior to the ""Fumbling..."" version, and Tom Waits' ""Ol' 55"" is a refreshing improv, especally for someone known for their pristine studio production. And the CD-Rom program isn't bad either!It's an essential listen for fans of hers to see how the final work developed, but the casual fan will also enjoy it a great deal. In fact, I owned this before I owned ""Fumbling..."" (although I was very familiar with it). A nice little portrait of the artist at work.",1
"Could have been better: This is a very well written book and is full of details about Sandy Weill but the entire book plays on him being an undertrodden jew, but he fails to take into account that you don't have to be jewish to be the underdog - take Frank Lowrys Pushing the Limits he was jewish lived in the ghetto and there was not one mention that he was a victim he just got on with life and made the best of it. Again this is a very good book just read past the constant comments about how he was always being victimised jew.",1
"Great Harp: I am by no means an accomplished musician. But, I can hack through quite a few songs for my own enjoyment on this Hohner Tremolo version. I found this unit easy to play, and to have a nice full tone. It is not shrill or scratchy. And it is large enough (has enough notes) for a novice like myself to be able to tackle many songs that I could not on my smaller Blues Band unit. Go for it!",1
"Character study: The Edge of Darkness is an affectionate yet clear-eyed character study depicting individuals (usually in marriages) in an isolated Maine fishing cove. The plot centers around the death and imminent funeral of the village matriarch, seen through the eyes, experience, and relationships of shopkeeper Lucy. Chapters are fairly brief and somewhat interconnected but stand-alone as studies of the way women (often, though occasionally the men are featured) deal with the daily struggles of relationships, making a living, and hopefulness in an unforgiving environment. In some ways it's a 'feel good' book, in that some of the lives/relationships turn toward hope realized. Yet these are stories which unflinchingly, yet with masterful nuance, describe the fallibilities of flawed people. Capably well-written, non-romanticized, and wonderfully descriptive of the Maine seacoast, the sea itself, and the lives of those who live and work on or near the water.",1

"No Second Book Let Down.....: After greatly enjoying the first installment of the Andy Carpenter series, ""Open and Shut"" I was so hopeful that the next in the series would be just as solid entertainment. I wasn't let down. Court room drama mixed with dry humor with a plot that is fast paced, if a little familiar. Characterization is Rosenfelt's gift, if you like regular guy humor and an eccentric cast of supporting characters.",1
"great for a beginner!: I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual. It practically loaded and started itself. Overall, I am very impressed. The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design. I better read the book again. I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas.",1
"Very Nice Game: I got what I payed for in this game. For one theing this game is basically just like the arcade game and happens to come with the Namco Guncon. This is very convenient in price as well as getting a good game. If you enjoyed the arcade game I seriously doubt you will find this much different. But of course if you don't like this game you must look on the brighter note that you have equally recieved the Guncon. You can use it on such games as Point Blank 2 & Die Hard Trilogy2. The game is fantastic. You actually save money getting this game. ... Get the game, be happy, have fun!",1
"Okay, not great: I was like many others on here- I thought it would be a great read when I bought it. I could not wait! However, I did not read the reviews on here before buying. I liked the book in some ways because of the timeline and how the families changed, but they did sort of seem to stay the same too. The only significant changes were the children growing up. In real life, all of the characters would have changed significantly. I really thought this book would focus on the daughter, hence the name of the book and the story behind it. However, I do not feel she really was a significant character in this book at all. She was just sort of in the background of it all in a way. I am a rehabilitation counselor, so I really was looking forward to this story. I was a bit disappointed because the daughter was not really a key player in this novel. I would not recommend this as a must read, but okay to pass the time if you just want to read something.",0
Minolta Dimage X20: I received this for my birthday. My friends and family can't believe that the great pictures came from this camera. I have printed all of the pictures on my printer a (deskjet 842) and they turned out awesome. This is my first digital. The zoom works fantastic. I have taken some awesome pictures at the Denver Zoo where I used the zoom and they are cool! I am in my mid 40's and if I can take great pictures with this than any one can.The downfall is the batteries.... It eats them like there is no tomorrow. (no matter what kind),1

"Would you want to evolve if everyone you cared for did not?: I can remember being a little girl and being extremely confused as to why all of those 'grown-ups' went to church to learn right from wrong. I assumed they were born knowing this, as I was...why did they need reminders?I know now that I am empathic, and have a robust 'super-ego'. I just realized at 29 that a great majority of the world thinks of themselves before all others. Quite a shock after spending a lifetime assuming the community around me cared as much about me as I did about them! It took losing all my material possessions and needing help from others for the first time for me to realize how things really are.Gary's books give me hope that maybe there really are some people out there who care/feel for our human family as much as I do.",1

Winston Hits The Mark Again: Having read most of Stephanie Winston's books I am comfortable in knowing that when finished I will walk away with practical information I can immediately put into practice. Her writing style flows smoothly. The information she imparts has been most valuable. She hits many hot buttons throughout the book. The glimpse into the world of the CEO is most interesting. I encourage you to read and learn.,1
"In desperate need of a remaster: If you don't know the story of Deep Purple, I'll make it short and just say they are one of the greatest and possibly THE most influential metal band of all time. Now, on to this actual disc, out of the hundreds of CDs I own, this has by far the WORST sound quality of any of them. The music sounds so washed out. It's completely unacceptable. Do not purchase this.",0

"Blueray live kills the experience with annoying movie previews: The movie is decent, however, why should I have to be FORCED to watch numerous movie previews from blueray live (yes, this movie makes your blue ray player connect online to force feed you a lot of un-skipable movie previews).Why should I be forced to view previews for something that I already payed for... This is disgusting, and is an offence to Universal clients because it means that this company does not value our time.",0
"I did NOT buy this tent for ONE reason: I read over twenty reviews for this product including some one and two star review. One detail in particular curtailed me from purchasing this tent and I REALLY wanted to buy it, based on all the other details provided despite a few minor complaints.

The comments regarding the back of the tent being an open screen alone kept me from purchasing this product, otherwise, I think it would have been perfect. Sorry.",0

"worse than Troll 2: Party Animal is a truly horrible movie despite a few scenes that make it ""watchable"" (and I use that term lightly). If not for the awesome soundtrack, the role by Jerry Jones, several nude scenes, and creepy/hilarious homo-erotic tendencies, I'd declare this movie unfit for anyone. Watch at your own risk unless you're into this type of movie, but at the cheap price it's not like you'll break the bank.",0

"much better than LIve: I played Live 06 for about 2 wks b4 getting sick of it. I traded it in for this game, and I definately enjoy this game better. It's much,much more realistic in terms of actual ability and skill than 06. For example: In this game, even if you contest guys like Ray Allen or Peja, they will hit around 75% of their shots. In LIve, even if you contest guys like Derek Fisher and, no joke, Fred Hoiberg, they will score at least 30 every game. NO JOKE!! The actual gameplay is more realistic than Live, as player movement and crowd and cut scenes are better and generally life like. The EBC player you create would be better if they didn't start him off with little to no skill. I mean, even the worst in the NBA have at least 1 definite skill. But besides that, and a soundtrack that sucks a$$, this is a great game. I'm glad I got it, and all I had to do was trade in Live for it.",1

"BARF!: This band sucks; I've said it before. WHATS THE POINT AT LOOKING AT THESE REVIEWS ANYMORE? I'm probably one of a few minority that rates bad music as well as good; what the hell do people look at this for: the only morons that review this crap are 13 year old boys and girls who think because this band pulls off a couple of chords does the scream-sing thing they're god. The icing on the cake would have to be the tight shirts *snicker-giggle*; because ""WHO would want to listen to guys with LONG hair? THAT IS LIKE... SOOOO 90'S! EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT FROM THE 90'S."" I'm sick of these freaking poser bands working off a genre, and saying: ""We don't like to categorize ourselves."" YOU JUST DID! Every band like this I know says that! The only good band on Drive-Thru was The Movielife, and some of the stuff Finch did. This is just another one of those bands that has the ""deep"" but shallow lyrics that every other billion type of these bands have with the long, but not ""too long"" hair. Whack.",0

"Classic Album From This Dynamic Duo: When I think of acoustic blues, I immediately think of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Terry's dynamic harmonica playing (and joyous ""whoops"") and McGhee's understated guitar playing make the blues a cause for celebration. This CD is actually a repackaging of two of their 1960 Prestige/Bluesway recordings (Blues and Folk, tracks 1-10, and Blues All Around My Head, tracks 11-20).There are no other session musicians used. This is Terry and McGhee doing what they do best--performing folk/country blues with passion and conviction. They perform standards, like ""Midnight Special"" and ""Muddy Water,"" but most of these are originals. This is blues that won't leave you blue. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1
"Great Journal: This journal is great. The only thing is that you have to be dedicated as far as entering your information. I am married, self employed with a [...]and I get very behind in entering my information. However, the journal encourages you to eat better and take better care of yourself overall.",1
"Really more about mushrooms: This book deals more with mushrooms and plants-as-medicine than actual sugar molecules. I find it rather absurd that plant products are discussed as glyconutrients. Any plant-based material has a good chance of being made from carbohydrates. Does that make it a glyconutrient? NO! Just because plant and fungal extracts contain chains of six carbon sugars doesn't make those extracts glyconutrients any more than plywood is a glyconutrient.I'm still looking for a good book about ingesting essential sugars in their most basic form and the results that one might expect.Bottom line: If you want a book that says ""here, eat this mushroom"" then buy it, otherwise pass on it.",0
"Lin in Florida: I've used this product for the past 10 yrs and am never without it in my kitchen. If you happen to get anything from a minor splatter burn while cooking or a burn while curling your hair it's the first thing to grab. If you use just a little immediately after the burn it will remove all burn pain and there will not be so much as a scar. The trick is Don't wait to use it. It's great for severe sunburns as well, this has been tested by me on my kids in the past and they are fair skinned.",1
"Not So Good: If you would like to have a adventure, you will like this book. But in my opinion, the book was not good. They all were talking and fighting a lot. The only cool thing in it was that they ditched school. The book had a lot of weird critters. The book was kind of hard to understand.",0
"Need More Mozart Orchestral Music...STOP HERE......: This set makes a great addition to Mozart's Symphonies. These Serenades easliy could be Sinfonia Concertantes. They contain great soloing and the music never leaves you bored. After purchasing several Philips Box Sets of Mozart, I am convinced he was a genius of many categories. He wrote great music in just about everything; from Operas to the Smallest Chamber Pieces, there is something astounding in everything he composed; what versatility and broad appeal. I guess that is why his music is loved by so many. Sir Neville Marriner is the rightful conductor and interpretor of Mozart, can't think of anyone of who does a better job.",1
"Unsure: After following Stephen King on his road to ""stardom"" I cannot believe that he would limit a title to 40,000 copies as he has this book. It is a slap in the face for any of the ""over 40,000"" fans who were unable to obtain this book. I ordered it well in advance of publication and will think long and hard about whether I will pursue purchasing this book in light of Mr King's obvious indifference to his fans (the people who took him to where he is!)",0

"PERFECT! ALL INCLUSIVE: Purchased this costume for a museum event where I work that features an annual ""doll"" exhibit. I dressed up as Raggedy Ann with this costume and really ""wowed"" our audience! The costume has everything you need but the shoes and make up. Previous review suggested to put on make up AFTER you get the costume on as the neck hole is a little tight...glad I did that.PUT THE COSTUME ON FIRST, then add your make up.I got so many compliments and would highly recommend this product. Perfect item for the money.",1
"Try something else...: For a young infant who isn't active, the SwaddleMe is a nice alternative to traditional receiving blankets. However, if you have a wiggler, this item isn't going to help. Our baby lasted in this swaddler for maybe three weeks until he figured out how to kick out of it. Once he got his legs free, he'd wiggle around until the material was bunched up around his neck--not a very comforting sight. So, we bought ""The Amazing Miracle Blanket."" It was truly amazing--it's practically impossible for a young infant to even loosen the material let alone get out of it. Baby started sleeping in the Miracle Blanket at 8 weeks and immediately was down for 7 to 8 hours at a stretch. We finally had to put it up when, at 5 months, he no longer needed, or wanted, to be swaddled. It's $29.99, but worth every penny. They have a website--www.miracleblanket.com. Also, the SwaddleMe uses velcro, which is ridiculously loud when you're trying to quietly change baby in the middle of the night.",0
"bad, pretty much bad....: Well, this book is pages and pages of disappointment and boredom. The storyline is vague. In fact if the plot is not important then the language and imagery should have been. But that too is really poor. Maybe Jha should read some more, for his creative talents and writing skills seem non-existent. Some chapters of this book are vague. The whole thing in the end leaves you wondering what was this all about. My advice--- run a hundred miles from this one....",0
"One of his best!: Congratulations Mr. King, this was a superb book! I can't tell you how moved I was by the character of Susan, I have never been so touched by a character in a book, save for ""The Body"" and that was over 10 years ago. I am anxiously awaiting the rest of the series, keep up the great work! -Erin",1
"good movie, bad dvd: First, its the 10th anneverary!!!! its time you put a dolby digital in this one (5.1) yes its 2.0. this [stinks].if you are looking for a good movie and you dont have a home theater, well this one is a good choice, ahhhh an bring a girl she will love it, all girls do....",1
"touches emotion: This CD touches every emotion in a very unique, calming and satisfying way. I bought this CD as a gift for my girlfriend (at her request?)... And I fell in love with it too. You can't not feel refreshed, head to toe, and deep within after listening. It is very well ballanced and very relaxing while deep and dark.",1
"It's OK, good price and worth it.: I could have returned this item because it arrived with a small crack in the whiteboard. There was no tray to hold any dry erase markers. For me it is fine. It is in a closet, and serves its purpose. This is a basic thing and I knew it wouldn't be top of the line craftsmanship when I ordered it. If you need something that gets frequent use, this ain't it. If you rarely use it, then it is perfect. Enjoy, I hope this review helps.",1
"Not true hip hop, but has a few song hip-pop/R&B songs: His best most recent album was Mr. Smith. It had real lyics and the wicked"" Hey Lover"". This new album has a few pretty good R&B; songs""Favorite Flavor"" is similar to ""around the way girl"" which is a good thing.""best dress"" is OK, it's a reused beat from Nelly's ""Play It Off""Horrible songs are "" Preserve The Sexy"" the chorus is horrid. ""What You Want"" is soo bad too.I don'ty know what's up with this album.I really don't get why nobody realizes how ""Control Myself"" is a whack rip-off of Missy Elliott's ""Loose Control""Overall a few good hip-pop/ R&B; songs but not a true hip hop album for the hardcore fans. Not really worth the money.",0
"didnt work: This product didnt work for me, may work for others, but you get what you pay for. I would highly recommend to try another product.",0
"As a Greatest Hits Collection CD, It Is Right Up There With Queen's Greatest Hits!: It is obvious that this set was harvested from the fantastic Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper Boxset and the result is a smart, succinct single disc retrospective for die hard and casual Alice Cooper fans. The artwork and liner notes are terrific along with his greatest hit singles. Many of the tracks are the edited old 45 versions which are very cool to own. Rhino records probably used Queen's Greatest Hits as a yardstick to bring Alice's legacy to the masses and they got it right with Mascara and Monsters!",1
Not what you think: Don't mistake this disk for the cool Roger Corman movie of the same title. This movie is so bad that I would have given it a 0 out of 5 stars it that option was available. Only order this if you have a perverse love of horrifically bad seventies adventure movies.,0
Disappointing: I was very excited to get the DVD i am a dancer and had to stop because of school so i though it would be a great way to keep some exercise going. i got the DVD and the quality was terrible and not only that but the DVD was boring. the backup dancer to Missy are terrible which i guess is there to show you that anyone can dance. I think this DVD is only for someone who has never danced before and is looking for something really easy to start off with.,0
"Not for true students of the norse: I found this book to be disturbing, as a student of norse mythology and a follower of Asatru. The lore was faulty and some of the interpretations ludicrous,as well as giving sexual denomination to asexual concepts. When compared to the texts that are claimed to be used in it's writing, the conclusions become a joke. This book seemed to be a wiccan book, trying to clump all goddesses as one goddess. While I agree that there is much lore missing about the Norse Goddesses, this was a poor attempt at best.",0
"Dishonest and indifferent seller: I subscribed to this for my wife who loves to read this magazine. its been a couple of months and 4 emails and we are yet to see the first issue. Needless to say, my card has been charged!Pls look for other sources.",0
Sony Bad Batery: Amazon has to look into the Sony Brand Battery NP-FM55HThere is a major problem with some these batteries they do fit into the camera. If one forces it into the A-100 DSLR you can not get it out.The Camera has to be returned to Sony. Someone has to get to the bottom of this Sony Problem. You should stop sales on the Battery until Sony corrects the Problem and removes the defective uunits from the market.,0
Love Glee!: Love all the Glee seasons. But then I love all of the seasons. Ryan Murphy and the guys can drive you crazy with some of the plots but that's what makes the episodes fun!,1
"Great CD for new MC fans: Mariah Carey is the biggest selling female artist in history, and what other way could be better to chronocle her career than releasing a greatest hits CD?When compared to other greatest hits albums, this CD couldn't even hold a candle. sony did a pretty lousy job on the production of the cover and the inlay is a pure mess, I bet that they'd do a better job for J-LO when she releases her greatest hits CD, AS IF!! But still, this CD is a great combination of old and new Mariah and is a must have in every collection as the music content is will arranged and covers the diva's history.In this CD you'll find all of MC number one records plus other singles chosen by the diva herself as her personal favorites and some songs picked also by Mariah that didn't get released as singles that are on her albums.",1
"I'm waiting for the extended version: My one star rating is about this product, because what we want is the extended version. The movie is, how everyone knows, breathtaking, but this product isn't the better choice.",0
"Best comb for long thick hair: All other combs are a joke if you have thick long hair. This comb works well and will last a long time, do not even bother with those other combs this comb is worth every penny!",1
Dial indication is out of alignment.: I have to return this watch because the dial indication is out of alignment. Bad experience buying Victorinox Swiss Army.,0
"Works Great Only for a While: The device worked great for a couple of months and then the computer failed to recognize it. The connections coming out of the device can move back and forth in and out of the device. I think the connections came loose internally or shorted something out. If you buy this, tape down the connections coming out of the device so they can't move. The item was so cheap, I bought it to find out if the technology would work because I read so many reviews where people couldn't get these type of devices to work. It worked great with a COMPAQ keyboard dating back to 1999 and an old microsoft mouse. Now that I know the technology works, I'll pay a little more money for something sturdier.",0
"For students: A great book for beginners in the field. I'm sure it would be a good choice for an introductory course, maybe it could even be used as a class book.",1
"ss stock pot: I ordered this product for a gift. It arrived with a large dent in the bottom, I assume from shipping as it was quite poorly packed. Thinner and less durable than I expected.",0
No effect on ink: I ordered this in hopes that it would take gel ink off several professional photos that were about three years old. The ink had been on the pictures about four weeks. The cleaner had no effect on the ink.,0
"A very fun B-flick!: Even though this movie lacks the standard nudity and gore that usually acompany a fun bad horror movie, everything about it is so unbelievably wretched that you just can't help but love it. Bad special effects, bad writing, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, bad badness, werewolf skeletons with ear bones, puppet werewolves, and accents that just do not make sense abound in this flick. It's just so amazingly awful that you laugh and have a great time with the movie despite your every instinct to burn the film and everyone who had any involvment with it. This will definitely be hated now, but 30 years from now, like Plan Nine from Outer Space, it will be a cherished film by all bad movie fanatics.",1
"cork yoga blocks: 4 Inch Solid Cork Yoga Block with Beveled Edges (4"" x 6"" x 9"")I like these blocks because they are very solid, light weight, and have a nice 'feel' to them. They hold your hands in place, which is nice. Also, the price is great. The only thing I don't like about them is that they are a little too large for me. Just slightly smaller would have worked better. However, overall I am very happy with this purchase.",1
"Great but easy: This book is a lot of fun to do. The are around, probably, 230 questions no less. Although it was fun book, it's a little easy. The pictures are a challenge and a handful of the questions will keep you thinking, but I got over 220 questions right. I NOT bragging. Anyone who already has seen most of the series and played the game and read the comics could score high in this book. Which doesn't mean you shouldn't get it. It's still pretty fun and is worth the read.",1
"You know ! This disc was a DVD-R, not a Blu-ray.: I'm order this title because I think it was Blu-ray Disc.But it's only a DVD-R with AVCHD file on its.Not only a DVD-R, but also this disc have only sound, no picture.Please aware before you place order in this title and similar title.",0
This is one of my favorite seasons: This is one of my favorite shows and seasons of Project Runway. The whole season was really great my favorite episode was when they had to team up and make a dress for Banana Republic. I have more favorites but that is my all time favorite. If you are a project runway fan and you missed out on season 2 buy you will be glad you did,1
"the critic complete series: This is an incredible collection, has of course,the whole series. Very reasonable price for a whole lot of fun! I recommend it highly.",1
Great old book!!: Now I once again have one of my favorite books from my childhood. My grandkids love it already.,1
"A great overview of each animal.: This book is a ""first"" encyclopedia and that is exactly what it is. A short overview of each animal. I like it and it is serving my homeschool needs with my 9 and 6 year old well this year. Just a taste into each animal. Not too deep. We read a page a day and the kids really enjoy it.That is what is great about homeschooling - the choice of what you want for your school. It is what I need and want. But if you want more and deeper, this might not be the book for you. Head the ""first"" and realize if you have older kids - you might want to pick a different book.",1
"Classic Metal: Updated artwork and the sound has been cleaned up a bit - a lot better than the cassette I had in 1989, or the demo-tape my friend had from 1987-ish. Deliverance is a great band - I've loved them since I first heard the song ""No Time."" One of the most talented metal bands that happened to be comprised of Christians.",1
Cell phone battery: This battery was worth the price. I bought two so I would have a spare.... Never needed it. I am still going stong on the first.,1
"Puh-leeze, Mr. Evey....: You'd be better off reading Michael Freeman's ""ESPN: The Uncensored History."" Freeman's book is extremely thoroughly researched and Evey comes off as quite a jerk. He thought because he brought the money to make it a go, it was HIS network (wrong) and he could make decisions without the input of Chet Simmons (also wrong). He also thought--again, because he brought the money--that he could take ALL the credit for ESPN (extremely wrong). He did occasionally have good, useful ideas but this is not a guy you would want to work with. Bill Rasmussen still can't stand to hear his name.",0
"Horribly vulgar: This is about as low as a movie can sink. There is nothing redeeming about the concept or performances. Stay far, far away. This movie is completely indecent and perverse.",0
REALLY sweet: I found this product to be waaaaay to sweet. I've had two bottles of it for weeks and I'm still not fisnished with it. I find I must mix it with another aloe product to cut the sweetness.,0
"Bad Product Bad Company: Basically this game was a let down from the day that it came out of its packaging, firstly there was no manual to speak of for UK customers and the game is plauged with so many faults that most of the time you will be playing a slideshow rather than being immeresed in one of the greatest air battles to date. instead you are left with so many crashes that the game will end up dusty on your shelf. It is an old game that has been rehashed but cannot polish a turd, Stick with IL2 Forgotten Battles as the graphics and gameplay are far superior.Too many crashes, Too many Bugs and GMX media have the worst customer service i have ever encountered, DO NOT purchase this title or any GMX games as when you highlight the faults to them you will not be heard and you will also be banned from their forums.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRUDUCT , as even high end machines find it unplayable!!!",0
great for homebrewing: this is great for homebrewing. I made my 1st brew in it and it worked out perfectly.you should mention that it's an aluminum pot and not a stainless steel pot. I was a bit disappointed by that but it didn't mention anywhere in the details what type it would be. Otherwise excellent,1
"This book is Satanism teaching!!: This book is very very dangerous, it is Jesuit-Satanism teaching.It is occultism and spirit-ism blending with the protestant world.It is one of tools from the catholic church to destroy the protestant church.Be away from it!!See:[...]Or enter:[...]rekindling the reformation",0
"The Best: I just saw this movie for the first time tonight. I'm amazed it has not had more attention. Excellent. I love old movies from the 30's & 40's. A friend lent me about 6 and this was one them. I'll never forget it. I didn't expect to burst into tears at the end, but try keeping the tears back. Can't be done if you have any kind of heart. A true treasure and I'm so moved by it, I had to post something here.",1
Not what I expected.: beautiful shot this film looks amazing. interesting story. i just couldnt get past all the animal deaths. they were too much for me.,0
"Size isn't Everything: While the subject is interesting the approach brings nothing new to the subject. The numerous illustrations are not organized in an interesting or novel way.As if to reflect the poor quality of the material and editorial approach the physical product is shoddy. The reproductions are poor, the book is not solidly bound.On the bright side it should not last very long.",0
Pretty Cool: I thought this was a good book. this series is the best. i thought it kind of sad that they were mean to veronica and plotting stuff against her. Shes not all that bad. It was sad and it makes you kind of mad at tessa and all them. but that aside it was a great book!,1
Could have been good: I tried installing this with windows 98 with no luck. I followed all the information for email contact and download to fix - no luck. Can't contact by email or get correction by download. I'm taking it back. I have better books than this on the tarot but was hoping the CD would be useful. Forget it!,0
"Good progressive bluegrass: Nice bluegrass, with sweet, solid picking. Several of the songs are a bit too wordy and very much About Something (steel mills, historical events, nostalgia for golden days gone by, etc.) There are a few tracks on here where they lighten up a bit, though, notably on the excellent heart song, ""Perfect Fool,"" and on a trio of fine instrumentals, but the gabbier numbers do creak and groan a little around the edges. Still, it's pretty much top-flight material overall.",1
"Carefull with Reviews: It looks like one hand has typed all the reviews. 95% of the review people have reviewed only this product. They are short, to look tru they give some time 3 and 4 stars.Check yourself.",0
"If the shoe fits...as no other man fits prophecy better: A very compeling case for the identity of the Antichrist. In all my studies I cannot find a better canidate for the Antichrist and with the fact that a Pope might crown this man ""King of the World"", as well as, ""Defender of Faith"" makes the author's predictions even more a possibility. Is there any other man primed, trained, and raised from childhood to better meet the qualifications of the Antichrist? We know that power was given to Satan to give the entire world leadership to anyone he wants, and the only question is if this man, unlike our LORD Jesus Christ, will accept the bait. Our LORD Jesus Christ put it plainly, ""What profit is it to gain the whole world but lose your soul."" Regardless, of any contrary opinions, I will be watching developments very closely and keeping my eye on who I now believe is the Antichrist. This is a must read for any person intereted in these end times. AMEN",1
"Don't waste your time or money...: A very short, out-of-date and overpriced book that offers little information. It lists a number of sites and screenshots and that's about it. Very oriented to a British audience.",0
"Only buy as a supplemental version: If you do not have a recording of the Brahms 3rd, I would not suggest this CD to you. The performance is simply too eccentric. I would suggest Szell, Walter, Reiner or Solti. And if by some strange luck you find a copy of the long deleted Steinberg recording, grab it right away. It is a great performance. If you already have one of the above, this recording may interest you. It is a perfect example of how not to conduct Brahms. Despite, that negative comment, it does have some moments of interest but not enough to be your only version of a great masterpiece. The Strauss tone poem is pretty much a disaster because of poor orchestral playing. Again, I would suggest the Szell recording. Despite it age and analog sound, it is still hard to beat.",0
"Pokemon Tattoo Series 2 (Tattoo Activity).: I bought 2 of this series for my kids, who thought the were great, but did anyone else but me notice that the cover boasts ""150 tattoos!"", yet if you actually count them there are only 50! You have to buy all 3 in the series to get the 150! Very misleading! Though the kids did not mind, I feel it is a rip-off!",0
"SPECTACULAR SOUND AND BEAUTIIFUL PLAY: Ronnie Aldrich is the best at the piano for all time. The 2 old records are with the beautiful melodies of 50-60's, with the sound of Phase 4 stereo and the London Festival Orch. I wonder to have all Aldrich collection in CDs, soon, with his later music at the end of London Phase 4",1
"Fun and easy: This is fun and easy to use. Even my kids can use it. Not only do you get freshly sliced pineapple, but you can also use the shell of the pineapple as a bowl to put the pineapple back into, or as a drink cup for fun drinks.",1
"Good and Cheap Fish Oil: I take fish oil three times a day. Whenever I run out, I buy this. I know I did a search to find the cheapest option the first time I bought it, and I assume this still stands as the most economical.I do not have any issues with ""fish burps"" with these fish oil softgels. But then again, I've never had that problem with any fish oil I've had. Either I've got good luck finding quality fish oil, or I'm immune to fish burps. These certainly smell funny if you stick your nose in the jar and take a big whiff... but why would you do that?I would recommend this product and I will definitely buy it again when my current supply runs out.",1
"Blah. Period.: A few funny scenes, and a lot of J.A.P. angst. If you're looking for a heart-warming romance, or some kind of sexual intimacy portrayal, don't stop here. Ain't. Borrow it or pay the 3 bucks to rent it. Then decide. Not to. Oy vey!",0
This sucked sooooo bad.: This movie made no sense whatsoever. Just a gorefest for kids. But then I only watched half of it. That was plenty for me. Don't bother!,0
"Great product. Inexpensive.: This is an excellent product. Similar ones from other companies are 2 to 3 times more expensive. The software is also great. Easy to install, a lot of functions, and it is free! You should download and test the software first to make sure it works on your PDA. The only thing is that I wish this device would work on a Palm!",1
"great hit: this song is swell a must have a big hit on my uk radio shows need more info well tune and hear it yourselves, taken from the album one good love. to be released soon cheers davesuperjock@yahoo.com",1
"sucks: this sucks . i enjoyed the movie and all the music in it made me think it would be an awsome soundtrack . NONE OF THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE IS IN THE SOUNDTRACK . NONE OF THE GOOD OLE SOUTHERN ROCK THAT THEY PLAY EVEN GETS MENTIONED. i bought it , played it and circular filed it . its in a landfill somewhere by now.",0
"Opened my eyes, you're not alone: I spent 10 years of my childhood in an abusive church. When I came out I thought I was so unique for having this experience, this book with the other testimonials and stories put it into perspective. I went from thinking I was on a spiritual battleground of guilt-ridden delusion, end-time prophecy and spiritual warfare being played out, to realizing that my experience is not unique. My church was The True Church, The Only Way, and I left it when I no longer believed that but I still had the fears of the consequences if I was wrong. Reading this book showed me that every church is The True Church. What a relief that everyone is so conceited, that my church is just a textbook cult. Now I can just focus on following God truly. This was a major step towards my peace of mind. If my friends ever leave my old church I'll give them this book.",1
"Uno Spin: Not much fun for two players...... More than two players might be more fun & exciting. Played twice, never used the spin.....",0
Not Worth the Money!: I bought this for my 2nd child simply b/c it was the most expensive ... so it had to be the best...right??? ... WRONG! The cheap basic one I had for my 1st child was much better! This one makes the baby sit really high out of the water and the baby quickly gets cold. Plus it left a large red mark on my sons back. He never seemed comfy in it! It was great while we used it for the baby sling but after that it was horrible!,0
"Very Disappointed - False Advertising: I purchased this product because I thought my four year old daughter would love this item. I felt it was a great alternative to the Light Bright (no need to worry about pegs all over the house). Unfortunately, it doesn't work like the packaging cover or the commercial. It is nearly impossible to recreate the pictures displayed on the commercial. It's hard to see the lights and manipulate the spectra light board. Don't waste your time. You're better off purchasing the original Light Bright or Magna Doodle.",0
"too short, too basic: This book is to short. I would have assumed that it would be chop full of cases, and that was why it was so short. Wrong! If you like forensic anthropology books that deal with cases in nice greamly detail than you should stay clear of this one.",0
"The truth will set you free.: The second Vatican Council in the section Gaudium et Spes (The Church in the Modern World) states in 62: ""Let it be recognized that all the faithful, clerical and lay, posses a lawful freedom of inquiry and of thought, and the freedom to express their minds humbly and courageously about those matters in which they enjoy competence. Hans Kung is a most competent church historian. I highly recommend for reading to all who want to be well informed his delightful short history of the Catholic Church.",1
"Sofa Console Table: excellent piece of furniture, i love it. i would definitely recommend this to anyone to buy, especially my family and friends.",1
Works well: This Halti collar worked well at controlling my Great Dane. He learned not to pull very quickly.,1
"Very Light Workout: I really liked the IDEA of this video, but like some of the other viewers said, there was a lot of repetition. Some of the movements are fun, but that didn't make up for feeling like you weren't really getting a workout. I'm not into super intense workouts, and even really like the idea of working out in bare feet, but it was way too easy. Also, most of the repetitive movements involve light bending of the knees over and over. I felt like it wasn't very good for my knees because they kept popping and making noise while doing the movements. If you are looking for a fun, very light cardio workout then I would recommend it but not to target the buns or work up a sweat.",0
"Has ""Riverside"": Great album. Brings back lots of memories. It's the only place I can find ""Riverside"".",1
"Best book on differential equations that I know of: I wish there were more Mathematics books like this one. Rigorous but still as clear as it's possible. And there are several exercises, with answers!I can't think of a better book on the subject, and being a Dover reprint of an old publication, it's also incredibly cheap!Anyone studying ODEs ought to have this one.",1
"Comedy gold: My husband and I got a good laugh out of this. So, it helped my marriage in that way. To read why it's such an awful book, give the other one star reviews a read. I wish I had before I bought it.",0
"They aren't lying, it's hot: Hot but delicious! It has whole peppers in it that I do not eat, but otherwise I love the whole thing. A good replacement for the G'Day Gourmet Tuna Chili Amazon no longer carries. It's terrific in pastas and salads. No need for any mayo. Just drain some of the oil and eat.",1
"Not recommeded for any level: I felt that it would be worthwhile to warn chess players of any level before they consider getting this piece of trash. Looking at the other recent reviews they point things out well, i.e. One entire very easy to find checkmate problem takes up an entire page not using real chess notation. The Title implies it is a teaching book but it has no lesson plan and covers an extremely narrow scope of material.Here is what I do recommend (as pointed out by some others): THE ART OF THE CHECKMATE (the best book on checkmates avaialable).",0
"Blah: Incredibly repetitive yet incessantly unclear, Rizzo's text is a bore. Find a different art direction book if you are seeking such information.",0
"Kill my stomach!: Just started taking these because they are supposed to be easy on my stomach. I took with my dinner, second day taking them and my stomach is so bloated with gas that it feels like it is ready to explode. I've been extremely uncomfortable all day.

Lisa Marie Rocks: I recently purchased Lisa Marie Presley's CD and I really love it! She has a unique style of her own and that hint of soul like her Dad had in his time. I hope people won't compare her to Elvis and let her produce her own style of music that is hers. I grew up listening to Elvis and it's really inspiring knowing I'm now listening to his daughter keeping that vocal talent alive! I hope Lisa continues to make her music and great CD's like To Whom it May Concern.,1
"The reason to purchase:: The original version of the now classic ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" in all its extended, funky, TEMPTING glory!",1
"""Safe"" made me sick! Cinematic torture...: Safe is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It ranks among Ace Ventura 2 and the remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau featuring Marlon Brando.Safe is agonizingly slow, stupefyingly boring and if you're any kind of a skeptic (like myself) you'll be rolling your eyes constantly. Don't waste your time with this stinker.Multiple chemical sensitivity has been defined as ...If you sympathize with people who wear foil beanie caps and live in overturned toilet bowls, this is the movie for you! By the way, I say all of these things as a huge Julianne Moore fan. If it hadn't been for her, I would have stopped the movie 15 minutes into it.",0

"Rogues' Reform by Stephanie Laurens: Rogues' Reform contains three complete novels by the Bar Cynster author. For accuracy of the period, there are few authors to beat Stephanie Laurens, and although less 'raunchy' than her later books, each book is a delightful read. They individually chronicle the journey into love and marriage (or in the case of the first book, ""The Reasons for Marriage"" the other way around) of the Lester sibblings, Lenore, Jack and Harry. ""A Lady of Expectations"" is Jack's story, Sophie is the lady in question, looking for a wealthy husband as she is no heiress. The best of them all is ""An Unwilling Conquest"", which is Harry's story. Leaving town to avoid the machinations of match-making mamas following the revellation of the fortune recently inherited by the two Lester brothers, Harry determines he won't fall into any woman's clutches. Ah well, not two miles out of Newmarket, on the way to the races, he meets Lucinda Babbacombe. All in all, a lovely read.",1
"Well Done!: Mr. Klier takes a challenging and very compelling topic and manages to serve up a feverishly paced novel distinguished by its balance and fair-mindedness. Well done, I say, and I look forward to more intelligent reads by this author.",1
"Why even come back??: it's hard to believe it is 2001 especially after you listen to this album?The Go-Go's are still going for the Female Beach Boys Formula in Hopes of that Hit.i can still hear echos of ""We Got the beat"" here.it's the same basic formula that worked wonders for them in the 80's but someone needs to tell them that was cool then but a Good Retirement Party is a Must.take the Bangles back with you unless you are only gonna play Hits??the Arrangements&predictable Instrumentation is all here&it wasn't Missed by Me.it was cool in the 80's but unless Puffy or somebody else's Rips them Off they are best left back there to me.nothing has changed then or now.",0
"This is a must-have nite time treat!: OH! What can I say but ""mmmm, mmmm, good!"" This stuff smells and tastes like you are drinking something decadent, but at only 1.5 calories, its good for you AND your diet. I usually add one sweetener and a drop of milk to bring out the flavor but you could very well drink it as is and just inhale the aromatic fumes. I believe I actually started sleeping better at nite when I started drinking this brew, prerferring it to my usual sleepy time/chamomile night cap. Go figure!",1
"GREAT Printer, so-so scanner: I bought this printer to replace an Epson CX5400 that died before it's time. I absolutely LOVE the quality of the printouts - crisp, clear, A+. It is also remarkably quiet. The scanner quality is less than stellar - the Epson was much nicer. Scans are too light so I have to copy everything first, darken and then scan - a waste of time when scanning receipts for business. Still, would make the same ourchase again.",1
"Great product: Order went smoothly. I use the stylus about 2 weeks now and it's great. It gives a nice feel on the screen and having the pen that comes with it it's a good backup, cause I don't carry any pen with me besides that.",1
Good read continued.: I continued to enoy this trilogy as much or more than the first book. Sometimes the middle book in a trilogy seems to be nothing more than a bridge that wastes your time on words building up to the final book. This book has a story all it's own. Very refresshing especially in fantasy.,1
"Boo!: My younger sister and I just got the DVD so we didn't have to change from the VCR to the DVD player when we watch our Christmas Eve Christmas Movie Marathon. We've been doing this for thirteen years, and I wasn't too happy with changing to DVDs because I'm an old-fashioned kind of gal and I like to stick to tradition. But I bought it under my mom's insistence. So we put it in this morning, and damn it if I was expecting the same movie. Do not edit a good thing! Why would you replace Fame and Fortune??? What is the reasoning?!?! We were severely disappointed, and now I've read some of these reviews and I'm really upset. If you like your movies as you grew up with them, don't buy this. Booooo!",0
....boring: This movie was very boring and I dint follow the plot at all. I love seeing white men and black women together thats the main reason I watched it.,0
"1776: IF YOU ENJOY MUSICALS AND AMERICAN HISTORY, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU. AN ACCURATE RENDITION OF HOW OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WAS HASHED OUT. (WRITTEN IN SONG NO LESS) EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A HISTORY BUFF IT'LL AT LEAST HELP YOU OUT PLAYING JEOPARDY. GREAT DVD!!!!!",1
"Great Soap Opera! What? You Say This Was a Wrestling PPV?: I coulda sworn I was watching General Hospital. I was shocked to see this was WWE's Armageddon ppv as I looked at the title. I'm sorry, but there was one good match on this whole card. Most of the card was thrown together with no stories, and Tim White committing suicide was completely dtupid and idiotic. Taker and Orton was the only good match, but for a Hell in a Cell it was probably one of the worst Cell matches in history. I am shocked to see that some people actually enjoyed this ppv. I guess wrestling fans theese days only like storylines and not matches. Here's a suggestion, if you like storylines more then wrestling, watch a soap!!! End of story.",0
"Vinyl on CD: Although it's great to see all of these songs together in a somewhat comprehensive package (except for Pal Joey's 'Hot Music' which has nothing to do with the 80's theme since it's a 90's Acid jazz track).The main glaring problem with this collection is that it's mostly culled from VINYL recordings, featuring pops and crackles on just about all the songs on this CD.These are NOT digital masters of the recordings, just someone putting their very used record collection on CD.I'm shocked that a company of Rhino's stature would release something of this poor quality.Who's sleeping on the job over at quality control there? Or was that position eliminated?.Avoid this CD unless you just really want to hear the tunes, no matter what the quality. Great idea, bad execution (a lot of that going around these days).And to the schelps over at Rhino; you're on notice.",0
"Great Product, But: The product is great , since the plug is grounded, you need an adapter, especially in foreign countries. Product description should include this information.",1
"Total Junk: I've used mine twice. I have yet to get an edible waffle from it. Every waffle tears to shreds when I try to remove it. Instead of non-stick, they ought to call it maximum stick.",0
Should have paid attention: This purchase would have been top quality had I paid attention when I placed my order and purchased the CD and not the cassette. I don't even have a cassette player in my house. I did find one so that I could listen to the songs I needed on this release. Otherwise this is a really great product.,1
Crash Review: I chose this rating because it is not a full screen showing. It is very difficult to view widescreen! Purchasers should be informed before making the purchase!,0
"Vampyre?: I guess when I saw the way Vampire was spelled in the book, I should have gotten a clue as to how the entire book was written. This reminds me of how kids in school try to spell their names in different ways which is really where this book should be targeted....kids in school.There are quite a few shortcomings with the way this particular vampire, excuse me, vampyre is created. He complains so much about his fate, it becomes quite monotonous. He also walks in the sun without any problem. Must be a new set of rules for vampires, uh vampyres. Must go with the new way they spell their species.I found the book to be trite and not even remotely interesting. Unless you really have nothing else to read, I would not recommend this one to a vampire lover.",0
"Thriller or Comedy?: OMIFG! This was one of THE worst movies ever made! Me and my cousin watched it last night, and were crackinig up, the script is hilarious! Who actually talks like that?! We watched it for a half hour only because we wanted to see if it would get any better, uhhh...sadly, no. We watched ""American Beauty"" instead *brilliant.* I really loved James Marsden in ""Gossip""-which was an excellent movie, but the only thing 'disturbing' about this was the writing. Like James, l also liked his weird friend in ""Wasted"" but not at all in this. I love Katie Holmes, but even she couldn't help this project, talk about a WASTE OF FILM MONEY AND TIME!",0
"Great TV Wall Mount: This product was well engineered, easy to install, and easy to use with little to no maintenance.I would recommend to a friend or family member to purchase.",1
"over-rated--money better spent elsewhere: This dictionary is over-rated and not worth the money. Yes the format of the 3rd Edition is an improvement, since in early editions it was hard to mine through all the data to get to the point. Bauer is still too wordy, and for the price of this book you can get a Thayer, and LSJ Middle, and a Greek concordance to the NT.",0
"Not a great buy: It's got it's good and bad's defintly jacked up in price though. It is like they say a very nice and light headset, but i had major issues keeping it in my ear, it does come with 4 different kinds of attachments to fit your ear, but i still couldn't find the right one to fit right perfectly in my ear and actually stay without having to adjust it every few minutes. Overall not very happy with the product, and i'm probably going to go just purchase another headset that is actually not over priced",0
"Against all odds: I'm a Jack Higgins fan, so I'm inclined to be supportive, BUT, this character strains belief to the limit....with actions bordering on superhuman and a villainous depiction of ""friends"" and lovers, you end up saying ""unbelievable"".",1
"Dansk Tray: We are using the Dansk trays on our foot stool which also functions as a coffee table. Two trays fit well and look custom made for this use. The clean, natural wood blends with the comtemporary style of our home.",1
Buyer Beware: I tried this product and it took off a ton of skin from my face...i used it on the sides of my face and now ive got burns on my skin...called the company and they were not helpful at all...buyer beware!!,0
"Useless for learning anything: I've not yet run across an XML book that offers really good training. Creating your own XML tags is child's play, but good skill with DTDs and XSL is needed, as well as other applications of XML. Because a book has a limit on thickness, the covering of each XML application is spread too thin in XML books.I took a look through the ""just XML"" book, expecing more. I don't want someone to provide a thin coverage of just enough information to allow me to determine they know something somewhat. I want them to explain, and provide good examples and applications to work myself. Skill-building comes through 'hands on' training, not through a thin coverage about each application of XML.I'm learning alot about how to create valid XML documents, with long complex DTDs, but couldn't learn anything from this book. I recommend a 'how to' book with hands on practices.",0
"Great Read!: I have never read such and incredible book before. Not only did Sister Secrets offer drama, it offered mystery, and comedy. This book was so good, it's in a class of it's own. I was on the edge of my seat from the second page. The point is to read the entire book carefully, I got lost at some points, but I'm reading it for the second time in one week to close the gaps!",1
"good so far: they were as described, installed very easy. Only time will tell how good they are. So far so good, Akebono should be good.",1
not well-written: I did not get what I was hoping for. I wanted a book that would make a very complex subject much more easily understood. Instead I got something dense and impenetrable. I'll have to continue my search for a book that makes time travel more easily understood by the layman. This wasn't it...,0
Up in a cloud of smoke: Yet one more Black and Decker BV4000 with melted outlet prongs. Opened it up and it's all melted.Ruined a really good extension cord as well as itself.I'm very disappointed.,0
Beach music: Pat Conroy is full of surprises in his books and I suspect he had some troubles in his family when he was young as it always comes back in his stories and quite vivid.,1
"...where credit's due: The book contains the usual Paramount boilerplate, ""Based on Star Trek created by Gene Roddenberry"" (and all the spin-off series), and thanks Teri Garr among others, but the author has not seen fit to acknowledge, even in the slightest, writers Carey Wilber and Gene Coon, who created Khan Noonien Singh for the ""Space Seed"" episode of Star Trek.Without them this book would not exist. For shame.",0
Don't buy this product: This thing doesn't even work. What a waste of time and money! Now I have to go return it. I'll never buy another Memorex product again! I've had much better experiences with SanDisk brand card readers. I'm very disappointed with Memorex's low quality. Save yourself the hassle and don't buy Memorex products!,0
fantastic films: I was browsing dvd's and came across this collection. I had always enjoyed watching the Sinbad and Jason films years ago so I decided to buy this collection and watch them again. I must say that I am very happy with this purchase - the films are still exciting to watch and my grandaughter can't watch them often enough. She really enjoys the cyclop scenes. Definitely a good package!,1
"beautiful poem: I Loved ""Revelation."" Read the book a few times and I see something new each time. Easy to read, and not abstract. I hope I find my soul mate....",1
A piece of junk: Like many others I have always thought of Linksys as a reputable company with a decent product for the cost. This is definately not the case with the Linksys Compact Wireless-G Internet Video Camera I have owned this camera for a while now and after many wasted hours of trying to get it to work reliably I have given up. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. Even when it does work the picture is fuzzy and forget about getting a usable picture in any type of low light environment. Spend a bit more and get a better quality product.You will be wasting your money with this one.,0
"magnetic ring 2-tone: I thought the product would have been better made. the first day i wore it my finger turned dark. the coloring from the ring had rubbed off and the finger was all black. I was able to spread the ring to fit my finger. Not sure if the two magnetic have helped. I stop wearing it because of the coloring on my finger, it didn't look good.",0
"Best soap ever: I never use soap on my face, because it can clog pores and dry skin at the same time. I have combination skin and mild/moderate acne (I'm 35). This soap is fantastic! If you think about the price in terms of replacing a bottle of cleanser, it really isn't too bad. A little goes a long way. Now the primary reason I bought it was for my daughter's eczema, and though it didn't cure her, it may have improved her condition and definitely hasn't had the negative effect that most soaps do. Save yourself the effort and money - order a couple bars right off the bat. Plus, it takes care of those little bumps some kids get on their cheeks in cold, dry weather! You won't be disappointed. Do be careful on storing your Adovia though - don't leave it in the shower to melt.",1
"Great Watch: I ordered this watch and was immediately astonished by its look and feel. It was a really sturdy watch. Well, I lost it about 6 months ago and I was heart broken!!",1
Boring: Too much history! Felt like I was reading a history book. Would have liked more personal info.,0
"The Damned's final masterpiece: This was the last album Captain Sensible had any hand in making, going solo in 1984. The songs are fantastic and a little more ""bright"" than on the previously released ""Black Album"" (also excellent!). My favorites are ""Stranger On The Town"", ""Ignite"", ""Life Goes On"", ""Dozen Girls"" and ""Under The Floor Again"", which has a soaring guitar solo outro, you've got to hear it to believe it. I can't believe this masterpiece is ranked 56,000 something on the sales list. But I couldn't care less. ""Strawberries"" is a perfect addition to anyone who appreciates creative, energetic post-punk pop.",1
The Best Value for a Cute Comforter Set: I loved this set because of the price. It's super soft and cute for girl or boy in this light green color. My baby girl has it accented with all her little pink stuffed animals. The comforter is super soft minky and the jersey sheets stay soft wash after wash. I loved that it had a flat sheet too. Most toddler sets don't for this price. But the thing that really made me purchase this set was the standard size pillow sham. Toddler pillows are a waste of time and money!,1
"Gross Omissions: This is not a comment on the substance of Dr Alter's translation. I opened it today for comparative study; I own three other versions of The Five Books. To my dismay, I find no Parashat-Named Headings,none; merely Chapter Headings,and Bk Chapt.#s at the top of each page. I sought refuge in the index. There is no index! I have read many reviews and comments of this work and none, not one, mentioned this glaring omission. For a layman as myself I find this book too tedius to bother with,other than when I go to another version for the missing information. It is beyond my comprehension how this highly praised book by a masterful author could be published without the norms I have mentioned.",0
"""NEW"" Stereo Recordings by the Original Artists, don't think so: This is false advertising, these are not original artists and sound nothing like the songs. Deceptive.",0
"This vacuum is a piece of garbage!: This vacuum does not pick up anything but a small amount of dust. If you need it to pick up something as big as cat litter, forget it. It appears to pick up animal hair but if you turn it over and look at the brush, the hair is just wrapped around the brush, not sucked up into the tank. This was a total waste of money.",0
"Two words, Don't Buy.: Man Pipe? Third Testical as source of power? I thought these kinds of plots went out with the lunatic fringe of the Feminist Movement. And I thought the Womb of God was bad.Time to take this book out back and shoot it.",0
"WHAT A DEAL!!!!!: For $3.32, I assumed I was only getting the shell to replace a broken remote. Much to my amazement, the electronics was also included! The dealer charges $60.",1
"Watchmen: Watchmen was recommended to me by several intelligent friends, and though I have been wary of the genre I figured I'd give the graphic novel a go. I saw the movie when it first came out, and I think that was detrimental to my reading of the original text. As printed material I found Watchmen to be surprisingly unappealing. The film seems to be very close to the original, but far surpasses the comic in terms of visual interest. The women were particularly disturbing, as the movie had lead me to believe they were supposed to be attractive, and not have .. mullets (yes, the original Silk Specter has a mullet in the text).I wish I had read Moore and Gibbons before seeing the film - I think I would have enjoyed it much more. As it stands, it was actually fairly slow-going for very little end reward.",0
"Another piece of bratz junk!!!: I bought this item for my daughter for christmas and it was a total disappointment. Just like all the other bratz items I have bought, it is not durable, it falls apart or falls over whenever you touch it. I would hope that by all the bad reviews and phone calls about their poorly made items that MGA receives, that they would start making better quality toys. There are so many bratz fans out there that truly deserve better. Parents don't waste your money, You may find yourself trying to explain to your child why santa brought them such a piece of junk.",0
"useless: This cutting board falls into the sink very easily, making it only suitable as a decorator item. I am very disappointed with it. I much prefer an over-the-sink cutting board I purchased from The Container Store, even though it's white plastic board is not pretty to look at.",0
"Not what the jacket and buying info says: Amazon offers many books that are much better on the loss of a deeply loved pet. While the art and writing are good, the way the story evolves did little to cushion the grief of three generations of our family saying good-bye to a very special dog. Ideas about afterlife were intoduced that brought confusion rather than hope to our family coping with the death of a pet that has been part of our life for many years. After one reading of this book by everyone, it became a toss-away, not a companion in consolation.",0
"Wonderfully delightful adventures with the Wallace family: After seeing the television series ""Christy"" I was very interested in reading more of Catherine Marshall's book. I went to my local library and found Julie. Julie is the daughter of a former preacher, now editor of a the local paper in Alderton, Pennsylvania. The story is set during the heart of the depression in the 1930's. Julie Wallace is an 18 year old senior and an up and coming reporter for her father's extremly small paper. Julie now becoming a fine woman is dealing with her emontions of both a family and romantic nature. The main conflict in the story is within Julie herself, but the physical climax is when the area dam breaks. After this the whole town must pull together and become one again. Julie is a wonderful book, so much so that I couldn't put it down. I'd recommend it to anyone with the soul for old fashion romance and time for a good book",1
"Very Loud!: Kind of hard to get use to the settings, but this can wake your neighbors... practice turning it off before you sleep.",1
"Well worth it: Very good quality. Purchased for decorations for a baby boy sailboat themed shower. They link together so we had some across the main table and others floating in the blue punch. They were given to the mother to be afterwards, so dual purpose!Also, the sails come off of the actual boats. And the shape on the sail is the shape of the ""hole"" (for lack of a better word)in the boat that you have to match up to put them back together. Very cute and educational.",1
hd showcase movie: this movie is a must have to really show off the capability of blu-ray and your high def tv. the picture is amazing as is the sound. i highly recommend. i also love the movie itself but that is a personal preference. a must have if you like sci-fi and want to see amazing picture.,1
"Confusing: Its mostly a confusing jumble of acronyms and ideas. Many contradict each other and the core premise of being able to prduce performance through motivation by tangible incentivization seems to run counter to most modern management thinking and current studies on behavioural patterns. The action plan portion of the book sounds more like a sales pitch than an unbiased analysis. And, the advice is pretty much outdated.Someone gave me this book as a gift. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.",0
"Very easy to use -- quick setup: Didn't take more than a few minutes to get this remote programmed and working with my door. Sleek, newer design looks great in the car too... :)no problems whatsoever...",1
"Would not buy again: Have used this toaster oven for a couple of months. It's really big, takes a long time to toast. Today was the first time I tried the bake feature. Seemed to take a very long time. Put in an oven thermometer, and after 45 minutes, it still had not reached 350. Would not buy this item again.",0
"Wonderful book, but where are my cards?: The book is very easy to follow and informative. However, it did not come with cards as described. I had to go out and buy a separate deck.",0
Switching controller: I returned this controller because it had limited charging features. I prefer the Pulse Width Modulation feature offered by slightly more expensive controllers.,0
"Very good: This two-part cleaning solution worked great. I had excess thermal gunk on my CPU from the stock fan and thermal transfer paste, but the first solution dissolved it. The second solution had a visible brightening effect on the copper.",1
Cordless keyboard LX500: I had worried about mouse response time as well as battery lasting time in placing an order on this item.But quite satisfied with both on my worries.Greater keyboard with mouse than what I have ever used.I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.,1
"If you buy it, you have fallen victim of methods therein.: The big title ""Ph.D"" beside his name follows the Authority method (chapter 6). The quoted comments are blantant use of the Social Proof method (chapter 4). If you buy other books of Dr. Cialdini, you fall victim to the Commitment and Consistency principle (chapter 3). But indeed, this book says very little that has not been said in Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""",0
Mrs.: I was told that this item was new. It was not. It had been used. When I put in the first disc it was dirty and had to be cleaned to work. Another disc had two skips in it. the casing was dirty and worn. I returned it for a full refund.,0
"Not for Die-Hard Beatles Fans: I am a die-hard beatles fan and I absolutely hate this movie. The songs chosen are the generic Beatles, none of the true good ones (come on, no A Day in the Life? or Sgt Peppers? or Norwegian Wood? or Back in the USSR? the list goes on and on). They throw in random Beatles songs that don't fit into the plot what-so-ever (Blackbird, Come Together, While My Guitar Gently Weeps just to name a few). Oh, but there are plenty generic Beatles songs: Hey Jude, I Want to Hold Your Hand, Something, All You Need is Love, and the list keeps on going. Don't get me wrong, those are some great songs, but the Beatles defiantly have better songs. If you are not a beatles fan or a somewhat beatles fan, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this movie. If you are a die-hard, like myself, you will not. All of my other die-hard beatles fans haven't liked it either, but those who aren't will like it. If you truly love the Beatles, don't waste your time or money.",0
"Jedi Quest #1:The Way Of The Apprentice: This book is a spectacular work of art.The depth at which Watson explores and explains the characters makes you feel as if you really know them.She goes along with the whole Jedi teachings,and the Masters and Padawans have just the right serene Jedi attitudes.There is a perfect dose of humor and plenty of suspence.The characters are well formed,and the small signs of Anakin's eventual destiny are scattered throughout.The way she explains the Jedi's actions and lives is very well done,and she shares the thoughts not only going through Anakin's mind,but through the Obi-Wans as well,so you realize that he often doubtfull of his own ability to be the master.I all in all loved this book,and can't wait to read the others.",1
"Master Mind of Suspense: Mary Higgins Clark has truely out done herself in this new book ""Daddy's Little Girl"". From the moment I picked up this book I could not turn the pages fast enough to find out what was going to happen next. As always she has you changing your mind on who dunn it until the very end. The people who come to her (Ellie's) rescue will surprise you also.I'm sure that there are many people out there that can relate to the title ""Daddy's Little Girl"" and how the youngest daughter (Ellie) feels. It may make you think differently about things in your own life.Have fun reading and I can not wait for her next novel to come out.",1
"????Live!: Could be anyone, with anything, playing anywhere. The band Filter would love this generic title!",0
Very good reference manual: A very good book for beginners and anvanced CGI programmers. However I would have liked all examples to include C code as well as PERL,1
"Wonderful recording but terrible packaging: This is a glorious recording of a charming opera, Massenet's best music, in my opinion, with exception of Thais.However, the cover art is trashy (the original one had lovely Von Stade in a blue dress runing (presumably at twelve midnight). This disc has no information whatever, no libretto, no pictures, no summary. Opera d'oro, much less expensive, has plot summaries and information in its cds. Too bad I don't still have my box set.But Von Stade and Welting are in wonderful voice as is Gedda and the whole opera and recording is a delight from beginning to end.",0
"Not very happy: I put it in my machine and it doesn't play at all, I don't have any problems with my other tapes, but this is absolutely useless to me. I didn't open it until january so it is too late to send back, but I will not buy from this company again..",0
"Classy ( and classic ) flute playing!: Solo flutist Martha Aarons has a winner with this cd, played with vitality, virtuosic technique and lovely sound throughout the works by Hummel, F.X.Mozart, Paul Schoenfield and Piazzola. All the tracks are great, best of all is Piazzola's Histoire du Tango, performed with rhythmic pizzazz and sensuality. This is great playing! ( Jean Pierre R., eat your heart out!) Excellent contributions by her colleagues pianist Francis Renzi and guitarist Jason Vieaux.",1
Do NOT buy this product: This is the worst utility knife EVER MADE. Stanley usually has the highest quality items; but who ever designed this one must have been mentally deranged. It is nearly impossible to reload and requires at least 30 minutes of your time to so during which you will slowly lose your mind. Get the cheaper easier version. Stanley; you should be ashamed of yourselves for putting out such a horrible product.,0

"NO NO NO NO NO: Seriously, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO... Thank God I heard this at a friends house. If I would have wasted money on it I would really be sorry. It is still boyband music, only song solo with one member. It ain't nothing special. You can get the same thing from Nick Lachey, Joey MacIntyre (sp) or Jordan Mcknight.",0
"Bad quality cable: I was a big fan of Sennheiser having owned and loved the HD-600 headphones for years.These, however, do not sound noticeably different than the stock iPod headphones and have one fatal flaw, the cord is a hard plastic and any physical contact with the cord transmits a sound straight to the ear. I am using them right now as I type this review. Just moving my head slightly creates a loud rustling sound in my ear.I am ordering a pair of Shure EC2s right now, maybe I'll have better luck with those.Bad.",0
It's an Okay Book: It has a lot of interesting stuff about China. It's kind of boring. It might not be boring to other people who read it but I am giving it two stars because it's not that interesting to me!,0
"Hanky-heads, grappa, campagna, rustico, olive harvest, etc.: I enjoyed this book written about their living experience on the Italian Riveria. I loved reading about the ""hanky-head"" characters of this town. I could almost taste the food they ate when they described it. This book also explained a lot to me about the way Italians eat. I visited Italy [Rome, Florence] in 2001 and could not understand whey the waiter gave me a strange look when I asked for more cream/milk for my American coffee after I had just finished eating dinner. Now I understand about the digestio system here. If I ever go back to Italy, I will be sure to get an espresso instead after dinner. I wish I could visit a small down like the one the sisters live in and experience the olive harvest. There were so many episodes in this book that were so funny and some that were very serious. I would love for them to do a sequel to this book.",1
Don't waste your money: The center bracket (hub) is very weak and broke almost instantly. I see no reason that this bracket needs to be this weak. They designed it in a way that it would not stand up well to a hard landing. It's TRAINING GEAR for crying out loud. Look for something else which has a stronger center bracket or two full length rods instead of 4 like this one.,0
"A Total and Complete Waste of Video Tape: Please See Below: Dear amazon.com: Please do not offer these Marjabelle Stewart videos for sale to any of your customers again. They are truly useless products.They are ridiculously uninformative. I would rather have saved the time in not watching the first one at all--yet I kept watching, searching for semblance of meaning in the thing. I had no such luck. They are also totally outdated, so the only possible enjoyment one can gain from them is to make fun of the acting and watch a guy in a suit eat a lobster at a business lunch (but if you don't already know never to order lobster at a business function, you need more help than just a video.) Both videos have been returned, and I suspect this will continue to happen as long as they're offered here.",0
"Disgusting, nasty, inedible: I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option. This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it. The only lobster in the soup was some shell. It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible. Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented. A complete waste of money. Beyond disappointing. It made me angry.",0
"Great Deal: I needed a three wheel bike for my wife and this fit the bill. Biking is a great way to stay in shape and did not want to spend too muchand still have value, after looking at different sites and reading reviews I setteled on this 3 weel schwinn. I put it toghether myselfit didnt take long was a little tough getting the rear axel lined up and adjusting the fenders.I would recommend if you are not a decent mechanicto take it to the bike shop for assembly.It does what it is made for ""riding"". I hate some reviews as some people complain about minor things in this case go for the big bucksand have something to complain about. This is a good bike for the money!",1
Safe for the whole family: The movies are great! Samantha is my favorite by far! I love that they are safe for the whole family though and give a bit of a history lesson too. My children love these! Can't wait for Kit to come out too!,1
"This is the STUPIDEST book I've ever bought on Amazon: I bought this book because the reviews were so favorable, but sure wish I hadn't!!! Its incredibly stupid and a waste of money. Unfortunately, its been over a month or I would return it! Unless you like making finger puppets that look like butts, DON""T BUY IT!",0
Should have known what I was getting...: I read all the bad reviews and I also saw reviews with flawless installs. So I tried it and mine was not flawless. I emailed the company's support address with my issues and never received a response. The output worked fine but there seemed to be a part of the driver that would not allow the input of the card to be used by the computer for recording in a DAW. On the monitor you could see the input into the card. I replaced the card in the studio system and everything is working well now. I may try it in a future new build.,0
"worked!: I had a dent in my car's quarter panel and used this on a whim since it was only $20. It did the job well enough. The dent was an odd shape at the crest of the panel, but it pulled most of it out and now you can't tell there was ever a dent there unless you run your finger along it. But no doubt it worked and would've been seamless in a different location of the fender.",1
"Good: The book was new but it wasn't in prefect condition, one corner of the cover was a bit folded. But the rest of the book is perfect. Thank you",1
Totally worth it!: Just got this bedding set in today and it's great! Colors are gorgeous and it's soft and a pleasure to touch. The sheets are a nice bonus as well considering just the comforter is usually the same price with none of the extras included in this set! Love it!,1

"That's what I am talking about!: If you want to fall in love with music and just the trials and tribulations of love, than this is the album for you. John takes you on an emotinal rollercoaster that keeps you wanting to take the ride again and again and again.",1
"Wonderful addition to our collection: High quality, realistic, healthy play food. We have healthy dinner, healthy lunch, and breakfast from Learning Resources. All high quality and I would highly recommend. Hands-down way better quality than anything you'll find at the big box stores.",1
"Replacing the Mask My Wife Took!: When I fly, I need total sensory deprivation: I already suffer from anxiety, and the increasingly stressful experience of flying on commercial airlines does little to relax me. Among other techniques, one way I stay calm while flying is to try to sleep through the flight, and sleep mask does wonders with helping me do that. After trying others, I eventually discovered this particular sleep mask, which I used for years until my wife decided to give it a try on a recent flight. Since she has decided to keep it, I am now ordering another.What's so great about this sleep mask? It all has to do with the convex eye covers. When you are wearing it, there is no pressure on your eyes, and you feel much more like you are in a dark room, rather than having a blindfold on. Of course, it blocks all the light, and the straps are easy to use and keep the mask secure.",1
"A Stinker for Christmas: Christmas With The Kranks is high on my list of WORST holiday movies. It is unfunny and filled with unpleasant people. So what if a family decides to go on a cruise instead of going over the top in celebrating Christmas? I started out rooting for Luther Krank because his neighbors were so profoundly obnoxious and interfering! Then he too becomes a miserable person...Finally once the Kranks decide to conform and hold Christmas after all, the neighbors are helpful and sweet! I'm amazed at how many people are calling this movie sweet and wholesome. I found it unfunny and actually rather unsettling. Heaven forbid a non-Christian ever move onto THAT block!Go watch A Christmas Story instead!",0
don't buy!: It is cheap material and is very poorly put together. One of our bumper covers ripped all the way across the top and the blanket ripped too. It has Tons of loose strings everywhere. Very cute but Not worth it! I wish I hadn't purchased this crib set.,0
"Don't Waste Your Money!: A friend recommended this book to me and thus, I was excited to read it. What a waste of time!! Boring, old suggestions that I had already read in other financial publications. Nothing new as far as financial suggestions on saving money. Do yourself a favor and save your money. You can find the same information on the internet with a little research!",0
"Creepy fun: The acting is marginal, the story is interesting, and suspense good. The movie opens with a man with his mouth stitched shut (so he'll never tell another lie or kiss another man's wife) and proceeds from there. The villian is given to melodramatic pauses and leers, but that just adds to the fun. The PR man provides some good comic relief.As a side-light, it's interesting to see how zoos used to look.All in all, a nice little diversion.",1
"Don't Waste Your Money!!!: Very little tech info. The title is misleading. The book covers some basic stuff like types of suspension, but lacks any real substinance. It covers mostly the installation of after market suspensions and not ""how to build rugged off-road suspensions."" Almost all of the chapters are taken directly out of the magazine. Save your money and skip this book.",0
"Great Product: Good product, timely shipping, and well packaged. I would recommend this seller and am happy with the quality of the monitor for a good price.",1
"His mother says he always stirs the turd...: Having encountered the praises of Sedaris by other reviewers online I decided to pick up Holidays on Ice as my introduction to his art. It's a short, fast, and hilarious read on a topic that brings much joy, sorrow, laughter, and terror to us all: Christmas.Flipping through the book before purchasing it I see a chapter titled ""Dinah the Christmas Whore"" and I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride. ""The Santa Land Diaries"" should be made into a movie. Or at least should be something read to your family instead of that tired old ""Twas the night before..."" rot. Blisters the Elf had me in stitches during this story. And the fictitious family letter ""Season's Greetings"" was a laugh riot.I will definitely be reading more of Sedaris in the future.",1
"Where Did All The Good Songs Go???: I have to agree with most of the other reviewers . . . the good songs are glaringly absent. I had to order my copy and had to call several different record stores to even get one to do that! I enjoyed what songs (with singing) from the movie there were, especially ""The Look In Your Eyes."" I was also hoping for the Lit song. It doesn't look promising for another offering from this movie for an additional soundtrack CD, but they seriously need to consider it. I'd have to say they ""dropped the ball"" on this one.",0
"Excellent Series: Season 3 is a splendid, true work of art. Wonderful acting by all parties.In fact, all 3 seasons had my wife and me glued to our seats.We started one month ago...downloaded all seasons this year.I am (almost) speaking in the early English manner; cheers.We will miss Matthew Crowley. Edith and Rose are the new stories...hmm.Looking forward to Season 4.Thank you.",1
"A Book for the Entire Family: Excellent book. This captivating story was well written. People of ANY age can relate to this book. Even though it's a book about the Holocaust, almost anyone that understands the bonds of humanity and friendship can relate to this storyline. In addition, most human beings have experienced a ""fence"" in their life. We have all (at one point or another) had a wall that separated us from someone or something. Overall, I think the author very respectfully told a story warped around a horrific time in human history. I would love to see the movie, I hope they did the book justice.",1
1 GOOD 2 GREAT 3 NOT SO MUCH: I think after seeing all 3 Paranormals this one was a let down... big let down. What happened? Who dropped the ball? I thought the second one was the best and should have stopped while they were ahead.,0
"I expected a lot more: I hike my dogs daily in the hills of rural Vermont, on the miles of trails out behind my house. I have one dog who covers many miles to my one and sometimes I worry when she's gone for more than a few minutes. I got this bell to help me keep track of her whereabouts, thinking that if it was called a ""sportsman's bell"", it would have a loud, clear ring that would be audible from quite a distance. WRONG! The bell has a high pitched tone and can only be heard from maybe 100 yards away. Also, the tab that loops on the collar is somewhat short so doesn't fit easily over the collar buckle. I bought a cheaper bell from my local feed store that has a longer collar attachment and also a clankier but more audible tone and I am a lot happier with this one.",0
Very sturdy toy box: Got this for our 15 month old son. He loved it the day we got it! He loves helping clean up. The lid stays up so that makes it easy for him to help. It's very sturdy and beautiful! Definitely recommend this!!,1

"Not worth it!!!: I loved playing Feel the Magic when I got it and love the look to it. So lets see, colorfull, neat, exciting, creative and most of all...frusterating! As I played on, the game got more and more difficult into levels that surpass anything worthwhile. I mean, this game takes hours to beat a single, 5 minute game. dont waste your time like i did, just chill out and wait for the good title...'till then...owning mario 64 as ur only game is better than blowing 30 bucks on this. but i still like it...i just can't stant it! lol.",0
"Books not avalible: I have had this kindle for more that a year and use it almost daily. More and more I have had to go back to books stores as the books avalible seem to be very very limited. Right now on my Kindle it says ""send us your input at kindle-feedback@amazon,com"" Try to find this, they do not want communication. I am now looking at other readers to be able to get books that I want, not what they want to sell. Think they will read this , hardly, the are no real people to call or discuss this with.",1

New New Orleans Cuisine: I really liked this book. It captures the fun and flavor of New Orleans cuisine without rehashing old recipes. There are new recipes in here that are fun to make. This one may be his best book.,1
"Gone to the Dogs: . I bought this book expecting a good weekend read, but this book is so confusing that there was just no getting into it. I was so disappointed because I have always enjoyed Cornwell's books, but Isle of Dogs is a waste of time and an insult to Cornwell's reputation. I feel I was cheated!! Stick to what you know Patricia.",0
"Good Reproducable Material for CBT Counseling: This is the workbook companion to the manual by the same author. The materials are well-designed and the directions for the children are clear. The drawings are pretty cute as well, which helps engage the child in the activities. This is a good start for a therapist's toolbox for CBT activities.",1
"Do not purchase Shea Moisture!!: I used this product immediately and the next morning I attempted to comb out my hair. As I began, I noticed something white all over my head. There was a lot of flakiness and I was horrified! I read on one of the reviews that if you use this product with another then there will be flakiness, but I used this product alone. We all know that African Americans use a variety of products to achieve the most optimal results. This product cannot be used alone due to our hair demands, and there are many other products out there that don't flake up when used with other products. I believe that a leave-in conditioner should be able to be utilized with other products. I disposed of this product one day after use. I would not recommend that anyone use this product.",0
ok product: cheaper than a nostromo n52...buttons are responsive...my major complaint is that the buttons are offset like a keyboard...if they would have put the buttons directly above/below each other i would have given this 2 more stars,0

"Thirsty Thirst KiLLS it. Again.: Thirstin Howl III takes ill raps, dirty beats, sick and twisted humor, and realness to the next level on this record. I first heard this cat in '99, and since then he has been dropping rhymes so skillful that the average brainwashed pop consumer and/or commercial rap zombie can barely comprehend what they are hearing. He rhymes more syllables than a public high school drops prodigies because of skin color/ethnic background. Gutter, gully, grimy, ghetto ass Brooklyn Boricua raps from beginning to end, peppered liberally with Spanglish and featuring quality guest appearances, including artists like Sadat X and Dana Dane, make Skillitary my favorite record of 2004 and beyond. My advice? Buy this record. Support real artists, with real skills. Then, after you put in your Skillitary CD, or pull up iTunes, or enqueue the .mp3s in winamp, you turn up the volume, sit down for a second, relax a little bit, and then, you get EVEN, steven.",1
"Worst Recording of Boleros: The worst interpretation of boleros I have ever heard. Its not what a bolero is about, that is romantic, soft, danceable music. I would rate it below one star if it was possible.",0

"Get the Bradt Guide.: I've used both the Lonely Planet and the Bradt Guide for a visit to Ethiopia at the end of 2009; it should be noted that a new edition of the LP came out two weeks after I returned, and that the edition I used was three years old when I used it.My opinion, based on the 2006 edition: don't bother with the LP. Prices are completely inaccurate to the point you wonder if they ever were remotely correct and crucial information is lacking and inaccurate: according to the LP one bus trip takes six hours by minibus (it takes ten) and there is no specific place to catch one of these buses (there is). The Bradt guide is much more accurate, has a more comprehensive listing of hotels, restaurants and more background information on Ethiopia. Do yourself a favour.Ethiopia, 5th (Bradt Travel Guide Ethiopia)",0
"If you're a fan of the older Heroes this probably isn't for you.: As a HUGE fan of Heroes I, II, III and even IV, Heroes V came as a big disapointment to me. For one there is no autosave which was great with the others. The game had great graphics with the factions but I wasn't too thrilled about the creature graphics. I have a big problem about creatures that aren't proportionate. It's ridiculous to have arms and legs that are twice as large as you torso or hands that are bigger than your body. I know this is fantasy but come on. There were also very few maps; hardly enough maps to put out on a game. Overall, I hate the game. If the other Heroes had played like this I would have never have liked them and I've been playing them for 10 years.",0
persistent problems outweigh size advantage: I have had my V505 for about 6 months now. I have persistent problems with the touch pad as so many have noted here. But I also have problems with the space bar not registering a touch on the right end of the bar so words run on without spaces if you use your right thumb to type the space bar.Another frequently occuring and annoying problem is the cursor randomly jumps to odd places in a document so I find myself typing in the middle of a sentence two lines above or some where else than where it should be.Some days I hate this computer. I wish I had bought a IBM T40.,0
"Very entertaining!: I love watching movies with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, both great actors so I decided to buy this movie. I wasn't disappointed. I didn't think the aliens were the best they could come up with, they are much better in Star Wars or Star Trek.",1
Excellent Pictures: I had a Pentax earlier and it was good. But this is much better. Easy to use and I just developed my first set of photographs and they are awesome. Especially the photograph of a sunset.,1
"Not very effective: I have the penguin version, which I just received. I measured humidity using a hygrometer. At full power, after seven hours, the humidity increased a mere 10% (22 to 32 percent...still dry by many standards) in a small 10 x 10 room.I therefore cannot recommend this device...it is inefficient.At the highest output, which I used, it is very, very noisy (water bubbling). I simply do not understand the misguided positive remarks here.",0
"Not usually a fan of the horror genre: I am not really a fan of the horror genre, but I will read about anything that is free. The Red Church is more than just horror, it is more creepy suspense. The characters are well developed, the book well edited (a big pet peeve of mine).I had read a couple of other Nicholson books and was less impressed. Now that I have read this one - which I have since learned is actually his first novel- I think I might give him another try or two.I think some prior reviewers had some issues with his treatment of the Baptist religion, but it is fiction which allows for literary license.At any rate, if you need a good read to chill your blood this fall you might consider adding this one to your Halloween library.I just bought an abandoned church and I can tell you what color I will NOT be painting it!",1
"SHORT lIFESPAN...: lASTED ABOUT 18 MONTHS, THE WARMING PLATE BURNED OUT (...SET LOW), AND POWER WAS LOST....EXPECTED BETTER FROM THIS BRAND.(...addendum 11/11)This unit actually failed after just 13 months. A call to customer service revealed the 10 dollar return fee; I just learned from another review that they want another ten to ship a new one.. When I told the rep I didn't have the serial # at hand, and asked if she could hold while I retrieved it, she replied , "" I can wait 1 minute."" For me, this was an all-time CS lowpoint. Let's see. $ 67 to buy, $20 to return, the prospect (...judging from other reviews) of multiple failures, and that's $ 107 plus the hassle for a year of coffee and enduring the flaws cited in other reviews.Look elsewhere!!",0
"This book helped bring me closure...: My husband and I struggled with IF for almost 6 years. The authors of this book were at an adoption conference a few years back; they were there to help attorneys understand just where adoptive couples were coming from in terms of emotions from infertility, etc.. My father was one of those attorneys in attendance, and he gave us this book as a gift. If I could, I would give it to every.single.person. that I meet. It helped me come to terms with my feelings and frustrations, and recognize that I really was 'normal' after all. I was especially appreciative of my family members who took the time to read it as well - I actually received apologies (for things they had said to us)from them!I currently teach a class to prospective adoptive parents, and I always recommend this book to those couples that seem to be struggling the most. I've even just had to purchase my third copy to replace the other two that haven't been returned! Thank you for such a phenominal book!",1
useless item: This doesn't help me transfer photos and movies from my phone to the computer.Not as I expected it to be.,0
"Likely the best tv episode I've seen: While I've certainly not seen every television show ever made, I've seen quite a bit. I'm not a huge QL fan, but I don't know if I've ever seen anything this good. Not perfect, but I still tear up a little thinking about the ending. Try to see parts 1 and 2 consecutively if you can.You must see the whole thing in order to truly 'get it.' This 2-part show would be very good without the ending, very moving with it.",1
"Very good.: I've wanted to see this movie for a while now, and i wasn't disappointed.I liked the movie very much.",1
"astonishing difficulty: Let me start by saying that Rayman Advance's graphics are amazing. They really impressed me. However... The difficulty and blind jumps border on ridiculous. If you don't have the code for unlimited continues, you won't make it past the second world. It seems like I lost 15 lives per stage, and then another 20 or so lives trying to defeat the bosses. While the difficulty improves the longevity of the game, the frustration jusn't isn't worth it. Wait till the Gameshark comes out before you pick up this title.",0
"Best muffin pan out there: I tested this brand new calphalon classic bakeware muffin pan against a brand new Chicago Metallic, and hands down, this is a better pan. I didn't use any oil on either pan, and the calphalon muffins popped right out, whereas the Chicago Metallics stuck like crazy. BTW, I used the same batch of muffin dough on both pans. You pay less and get more. I'm getting the bigger muffin pan.",1
"Plastic gears, bad product: I bought a GrassHog and got two uses with it before it stopped working. After four fruitless attempts to contact customer service (once online where I received a form response that didn't help, and three disconnections on the phone) I gave up. I used to be a great Black & Decker fan, but this was the last straw. I earlier had to replace a useless power vacuum that burned out.Since I wasn't getting any help on line or by phone, I dismantled the Grasshog to find that the plastic gear had been worn smooth. The teeth were totally worn...after only two uses! Who makes a plastic gear on a ""heavy duty"" grass trimmer? I strongly urge you to stay away from this product and I urge Black & Decker to go back to making products that work.",0
"Comprehensive and informative: J2ME refers to a diverse number of technologies based on the java platform.Many ""J2ME"" books focus solely on MIDP/CLDC, which is currently the only widely available profile/configuration of J2ME. Thus, you get books that tend to get repetitive in terms of their content, especially those books that focus on the ""basics"".Fortunately, this book does NOT confine itself to the basics. It not only explores the history of J2ME (a MUST for any serious developer), but it also deals exhaustively with issues regarding real world design and implementation of enterprise systems (a NECESSITY for developers wanting to do more than just games for MIDP). The book also delves into using J2ME in PDAs using kjava (the new PDA Profile, or PDAP, was not finalized yet at the time this book was published), and gives a good summary of other java technologies and how they relate to J2ME.This is a good book for both beginners and upper mid-level J2ME developers.",1
"Women of the Otherworld: If you read and liked Bitten, you'll most likely like this next installment in the life and times of Elena Michaels, journalist/werewolf.Not only does this book expand and continue the lives of the werewolves we have come to know and love, but it introduces a whole new cast of characters and races. Armstrong brings up the idea that if werewolves are real, why not vampires, shamans, sorcerers, Vodoun (voodoo) priests, half-demons and witches?Elena finds herself in the midst of a crowd of Otherworldians (my word, not the author's) and using all of her intellect and instincts to overcome the bad guys and regain her freedom. Armstrong does a great job of making the reader feel the captives' frustration and anger. By the end of the book, *I* wanted to kill Winsloe (and I'm sure you will, too!)All in all, another great installation in a very clever series.",1
"Incombustible Cherone: What can I say? I was an Extreme fan! After his Tribe of Judah's and Van Halen's experience, he's back with his great surly voice, less hard but the same strenght. It's a pitty that is just an E.P. with four songs but I expect that he releases some more stuff soon.",1
"Weakness exposing attempt: I'm afraid Jane Eaglen doesn't quite know of her own capabilities and limitations. Opera singing is not just a matter of beautiful sound. There has to be emotion, drama and charisma, none of these Eaglen has. Her Mozart is at least competent, though far from outstanding. But her Strauss definitely doesn't work! Just pull down any (yes, any) recording of Strauss by any (yes, any) soprano and you'll at once note how deficient Eaglen's interpretations are. No, she definitely is not for such repertoire. Besides, her top register isn't glorious at all - a liability in Strauss. This is just an ill-considered attempt which exposes her weakness as an artist.",0
"Great movie!: I don't remember the actual book, but I think Dr. Suess would be proud. Captivating story with a cute love story that made me want to plant a tree after watching it!",1
"Short Lived: This product fell apart after three days of use sound great love the way it fit in the ear but this is my second one bought (not from Amazon) and practically the same thing happened to each piece I am so done with this product, and angry I didn't even waste time to get my money back of $25.00",0

"Just buy the Internet-linked children's encyclopedia for all of these ""first"" encyclopedias: the product itself is fine, its just usborne's marketing. when I know that I can get the entire Children's encyclopedia (which is basically a compilation of this one, space, animals, etc plus more) it makes me annoyed that I bought this one. Also, I would rather them use the actual science terms, rather than dumbing it down for kids. they can totally handle it!",0

"Great Modest Mouse CD: I think this is one of their better albums, the CD has great hits including ""Float on"", ""Bukowski"", ""One Chance"", ""World at Large"" and ""The Ocean Breathes Salty""If you like Modest Mouse or any other alternitive rock band, you should not be dissapointed when you listen to this. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the short little tracks they called songs, for example ""Dig your Grave"" seemed pointless to me.",1
"This movie was so awesome and breathtaking.: I loved this movie. I saw it 6 times. It may have a typical storyline but I loved the magnetism of the characters that Chayanne and Vanessa portrayed. It was sensual without being ""dirty"", it was charming and vibrant. I love the music and especially the dancing. I have a favor to ask anyone who may read this. Is there anyone who can post the words (Spanish?) to the songs on the CD? I would like to sing those songs but I am afraid to sing for fear of saying the wrong word. Thank you!",1
"Absolutely top shelf: There is precious little video material from the father of us all, and this is an absolutely top shelf performance at the Marquee Club. Although you may have a broadcast copy of this show, the upgrade and clarity should mandate getting a copy of this. The other material on the disc is woefully disappointing with the exception of a short clip of Alex walking down Wardour Street. But who could expect anything to compete with AK's performance of classic standards from his repetoire. Alex, I hope they have your favourite smokes where you are now. Miss you.",1
"Old Is New: I ran the needle through the two records in Dylan's Blond on Blond in 1968. There weren't many records I owned, I was cheap. The record went somewhere, ex-roommates, ex-wife, I don't know. I got a hair and downloaded it a few weeks back and again found myself listening to in solid for several days. In 1968 I don't remember being impressed with the music behind the words. The players behind Bob Dylan are exceptional and I find myself paying more attention to the music than ever before - probably since I know the words by heart. Good shit Mainard.",1
"These headphones break too quickly: I bought these headphones because I heard that they were of a great quality and I expected them to last a long time. I have had them for only one year, and the cable has broken. Granted, I use these headphones every day, but I always folded them up neatly and put them in their storage bag. Well, it turns out that folding them up neatly puts some stress on those super swivel joints everyone's talking about; one joint cracked and subsequently the cable connecting the left headphone to the right headphone broke and I am left with a mono monitoring system. Believe me, I take care of my gear, and I am deeply disappointed that these headphones broke in such a short amount of time.",0
"I like it: I got my upgrade from Amazon for $280. And while it's a little expensive, it is a suite, not just one program. The changes are great, once you get used to them. If you are a long time user of MS Office, you're in for a shock. The entire GUI has changed. All the menus are gone and you have a bunch of buttons along the top seperated by tabs. The shock wears off after a few weeks once you figure out where everything is at. The reason I don't give it full stars is that there was little documentation to cover the changes for someone used to the old style. I was on my own to learn the changes.",1
"Thoroughly satisfied!: This book was received when promised, in new condition and priced very reasonable!I've signed this book out several times at the local library to use on my various projects, but owning it myself is fantastic! Thank you!",1

"They were ok for a bit....: I had these installed in my 2001 Honda Civic LX and they seemed to be great. The handling was great but after hitting around 60mph the steering wheel begins to shake. Then, after 5 months of having these bushings installed, the cold weather came and wow...what a difference...not a good difference either. They squeak like crazy after every bump in the road and going over speed bumps. If I could afford it I would get rid of them and buy better ones. I would not recommend these bushings to anyone. If you're looking for a cheap, durable resort to your broken bushings then sure. But I would invest in something a little less noisy and shaky.",0
"Over all a useful refrence: If you aren't a professionally trained mechanic, the Haynes manuals are a life saver. They take alot of the guess work out of what you want to do.

Even with this minor flaw, they are definitely indispensable to the do it yourselfer.",1

I thought I read alot before, but now that I have my Kindle the books just keep coming. A couple of days ago I had a problem with several of the keys. One call to Amazon and a new one was on its way in less than 24 hours. No hassle, no hidden agendas, just plain old great service.

"Amazon Rating System Revealed As Unfair to Good Authors...: I'm sorry, but this book, like his previous forays into the world of cognitive science, is a ludicrous (but readable) attempt by a brilliant mind to find some way around the inescapable facts of materialism. I'm not going to try to defend that position in this review, so take it for what it's worth.What I do find unfair, however, is that this book receives an average of over 4 stars whilst a competing book, ""Consciousness Explained"", by Daniel Dennett, receives a mere 3 1/2 stars.""Consciousness Explained"", while having plenty of debatable points, is clearly a serious effort to grapple with the problem of consciousness in a serious way, taking into account real evidence from cognitive science. Penrose's books on the subject, on the other hand, are a form of highbrow escapism.So, Gentle Buyer, I urge you to beware of popularity contests when judging books on-line...",0

The three ring binder style allowed us to remove the filler pages from wine sections we don't normally drink (blush, dessert) and add those pages to sections we drink often (reds!) Also includes a handy quick-reference chart with definitions of oft-used wine terms.If you are an absolute purist about recording the entire, full label on the bottle this may not be the journal for you. The space for the labels is ample if you are ok with trimming to fit in some instances. The journal is the size of a med-lrg planner so the pages aren't so large that you have tons of space to record tons of info or large labels, for instance.Certainly a good solution for the novice or amateur wine aficionado.",1
"No problem!: I've owned the Netgear sph200d and the spare handset for less than a month, however, it works flawlessly with my SKYPE account. I use this phone as a replacement for a landline. The VOIP service call quality is superior to the QWEST landline that I used to have. The setup for the base station was simply to plug it into the router. I had no issues with the handsets, including the extra one. The documentation was poor for registering the additional handset. It came up as unregistered, and then would not complete the registration with the base. After visiting the netgear website, I had to hold down the power button on the base for 15 seconds, and the registration was successful. I chose this phone over the phillips 841 because of the availability of additional handsets. I would recommend reading the user guide prior to purchase. I got a great deal at Frys for the base unit and handset. I would definitely recommend this model if you want to use your skype account without the computer.",1
"A Page Burner!: As a radio personality I interview writers all the time. recently I interviewed Wayne Perkins, who told me about this book he called ""ROOR"", which was his way of expressing Running Out Of Road. Wayne is a doctor of Hypnosis. He told me that THIS story happened in Albuquerque and that if I ever plan a visit to this wonderful New Mexico city, I MUST read this book! Well, I bought it, read it, and have decided that I will shy away from Albuquerque. What you don't know can kill you! Thanks, Wayne, this was a very insightful, and spooky read. Barbara........",1
Boring: My daughter is a percussionist and is always tapping pencils and drumming on her legs. I thought this would be fun for her. She didn't like them at all. Should have just bought real drum sticks.,0

"Not the man he appears to be.: Shelley Stewart is absolutely NOT the man he appears to be. As a member of his family, I have seen his astonishing greed and selfishness towards the family he supposedly cares so much about. He has poor relationships with his son, and most of his other children. He cares only for himself, and offers no help his family. Take it from me; buy another book. Large portions of this book were admitted to be largely fictional.",0
"Not bad. I feel I got my money's worth!: (...)Definitely a film for fans of vampire films, noir detective dramas, and Adrian Paul.My complaint is that the near future resembles the fifties too much-- a director's choice, I know, to emphasize the resemblance to Nazis, but I felt it was a bit heavy handed.(...)See this film, even if you don't care to own it.",1
"Question, if this book is so good, why: If this book is so good whay has it not been updeated in all these years?",0
"no warm enough ....: We chose this model because it seemed an energy-efficient alternative to our previous Holmes spaceheater, which had worn out after several years of use. The one really good aspect of this heater is that it seems very safe -- the moment it is tilted or put against a surface, it stops. However, it does not generate a lot of heat, even on the higher setting. We have a very small bathroom, yet even after running the heater for 30+ minutes, the room is still not what I would consider really warm (admittedly, I'm a person who is easily chilled.) We bought this in November and used it daily, but I was never completely happy with it, and now the heating element is starting to give out and the heater is generating even less warmth. We're definitely shopping around for something with a little more heating power.",0
"!!!!!: the song Barricades on this cd is AWESOME! i love that song, musically and lyrically its grand also World Dominator is really good too its more ska. ok well anyway this cd is good in what you'd expect from AAA, but its also a good cd i think for Common Rider, this cd makes me really want to get more Common Rider but i'm just too lazy right now to make the decision of which cd i want to get first. but yea this is a good cd",1
"Another with a damaged one!: Price was right and actually arrived before due date. Motor had damage that was not caused by shipping( Styrofoam was pristene)and unit was completely unusable.

"Lots of Information but not what I craved: My mom bought me this book b/c I wanted a BFing book. The first bunch of chapters were interesting but after that, I could have done without. I knew most of that information but maybe that was my fault. LLL did a good job with this book though. I read it for maybe 2 weeks and put it away. I wasn't quite what I was looking for. I didn't and don't know what it was I was looking for but I still wanted more information after having this book. Again, this is just my opinion. Good Luck!",1

"An Almost Perfect Collection: Within seconds of recieving my reciept for the new album I was tearing the plastic seal off the CD and inserting the new disc into my discman. I quickly skipped forward to ""Where Would You Be"" to hear the three songs which I had not previously heard. All I can say is ""Wow!"" I was completely blown away by the four new songs on the album, as I was with all the previously released tracks when they were originally released. As it was when I first read the track list, my only complaint about this collection is the absence of ""Cheap Whiskey"" from Martina's first studio album, ""The Time Has Come."" I realize that while this track wasn't really a great hit for Martina, but I find that her vocals in that song are just so amazing that it belonged on her greatest hits album. Even with that in mind, I recommend this album to everyone.",1

Excellent novel: I must say that I had enjoyed the novel. It did an excellent job of portarying King Albrecht as a hero worthy of renown. All the intrigues were excellently crafted. It did an excellent job of culminating all the Werewolf lose ends. My only foible with the book is that the aftermath is a bit vague.,1
"YIKES!!: C'mon... this music is filled with computer-programmed drum and synthesizer parts that sound more like a cheesy $49 keyboard from K-Mart than like a group of musicians. There is no dignity left in the score here. If you want to hear Godspell at its finest, look for the British Cast Recording-- 1999 I believe it was. Exquisitely played by real people!",0
Great pan: seems that the complainers out there all have one thing in common and that is they do not know how to cook. These pans operate at a high level of quality and if you are cooking your margarine and hamburger helper recipes you should stick with the cheap stuff. The non stick element prevents a cook from creating a fond and then the basic elements of sauces and more. Lastly non stick fry pans are good for making eggs thats all. These pans work extremely well you just need to actually know how to cook. and Amazon has some good books that could help you with that. My suggestion would be professional cooking by Wayne Gisslen,1

"Queen Enter The 80s With A Bang!: One of the best albums of their career, the Game is a little bit of a departure for Queen (their first album to feature synths). But they show they can still rock!

Best Songs: Play The Game, Another One Bites The Dust, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Save Me, and Dragon Attack.",1
"Amazing, Probably the best back country purchase I've ever made.: I bought this tent in 2006. I've used it for the last 6 years heavily. I've probably put around 500+ miles on this tent and I can honestly say it's one of if not ""the one"" best pieces of gear I've ever bought. It's light weight, compact and warm. It has such a tall floor 'rim' that raises 6-8"" up the sides which helps to trap the heat since the fly can be tightened down to just an inch or so off the ground. There are lighter one-man's but not by much with a full fly and enclosed tent. The cost difference is extreme for the 6-8Oz you might save IMHO and this tent has durability. I can't say enough about this awesome tent.",1

"Not worth wasting your time reading: I found this book to be almost unreadable. The story is a re-hash of countless better constructed and more interesting books and films. The characters are built as a composite of clich√©s and the 'secrets' that they reveal throughout drawn-out action are telegraphed from early on. Instead of focusing on any sort of psychological or emotional dynamic between the lead characters Koontz brings in an assorted grab-bag of scenery-chewers who clog up the book with histrionics and banal dialog. The only thing that kept me reading was the hope that at some point something truly interesting or unique would happen. It never did, and this will become one of the few books I've read I will happily toss in the trash rather that subject someone else to a tedious and worthless read.",0
"Bad art ...: I used to be an artist. ""Work"" like this is the reason I can't be associated with the scene any more. If there is any value to this movie, it is laughing at the ridiculous prattle of this guy describing his ""art"". The scenery is pretty at times. Spoiler Alert! Rugged guy braves the elements and arranges driftwood in a circle -- near another circle (which nature made - very profound). Or rocks. That's the general theme.",0

"No Way, No How, Gonna Pay for just Theatrical Versions!!!: I agree with the majority of the reviewers here giving the product a one star! You are absolutely correct in doing so - like all of you I have the original theatrical and extended editions. Why would anyone want to see the Theatrical Version when the Extended Editions are the best and only way to view Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Yes it is almost 12 hours but haven't you heard? The best part about blu ray is you can stop the movie and the machine will remember where you left off. Most of us including myself does not have 4 hours to view one movie but this trilogy is a masterpiece!!! Easily the best and most successful trilogy of all time! Yes even better than the original Star Wars trilogy! Let's send a loud and clear message to the movie studio - Fool me once, shame on you - fool me twice, shame on me!",0
"a great book: The author or authoress who can evoke such emotion in their narrative as to have the reader laugh out loud or weep has succeeded in the art of writing, and Mr Vance in this delightful book has achieved this goal.He writes about family, hunting friends, and gundogs but also, and with great respect, the object of his hunting obsession; the Bobwhite quail.Not only is this book a chronology of one man's life and passion, but Mr Vance also shares with the reader his knowledge of gundog husbandry and training, some fabulous quail recipes, recommendations of appropriate hunting apparrel, field shotguns and lots more. Indeed, his writings on the age old complexity of eye dominance for the shotgun user is the most concise I have ever read.As a Brittany owner I found this book especially joyful in that the author really does know the breed...the wonderful little French hunting dog to whom the author refers to as God's Bird Dog.",1
Why do they do this?: I enjoyed this movie a lot but the soundtrack is not worth buying. The songs on the soundtrack are okay but most of them were not in the movie. I don't know why they put songs on the soundtrack that's not in the movie that is just so dumb. I do like that song Under Pressure from the beginning of the movie that is a great song but the soundtrack is not worth listening to. I am sorry. Please do not waste your money!,0

"Worst book that I never read: Alright, I did start it, but I could not finish it. It was that boring. Don't make a snap judgment though, you should read it for yourself and realize that anyone without a brain can get published these days. A former boss who liked to drink and employ the services of hookers gave our team this as a Christmas gift which were some of the many Blink judgments he made.",0
"Interesting Read: After seeing the movie trailer, I checked out the first three books at my local library. I have never heard of the series before now, and was surprised to learn that there are twelve books. I read the first book in one night.Two teenagers, Darren & his best friend, Steve, sneak out and go to the mysterious Cirque Du Freak, a freak show. Mr. Tall, Snake boy, a wolfman, Alexander Ribs and Mr. Crepsley.Mr. Crepsley is pale faced, redheaded man. He is a real vampire and the owner of Madam Octa, a spider. Darren loves spiders and steals Madam Octa. This causes a chain of events that will forever change Darren's life.",1

"Not an attention grabber: ""A delightful new collection of original Southern stories""Collection is right... a bunch of short stores that confused me and didn't seem to flow together. You would end a chapter but the next would be a totally different story, a different person telling the story and whatnot. It was hard to follow though I was able to finish the book.",0
"Revolutions Disappointing: I expected so much from the build up of the first two movies, that Revolutions really let me down. Neo had a score to settle with the Frenchman and the Architect that was completely abandoned. Neo's fate was left completely ambiguous. Morpheous was reduced to being a navigator and Trinity's character deserved better. Fans were really let down.",0
Valuable Tool: I work extensively through church and community volunteering with the impoverished. Middle class is my fit into the scheme. This book has been an enormous help as I and others strive to build bridges and bridge the gap of socioeconomics. I feel many friendships have been made and maintained due to my reading of this book. The bottom line is relationships--one at a time.,1

"My Opinion: Breaking The Millionaire Code: I didn't like the book. It was a waste of money for me. However, I am not saying it will not work because I did not try it. Most all clue's of how to get rich are in code and you have to figure out the code for each clue. I paid for answers not a code game.This book is patterened after ""Think and Grow Rich"" that I read40 years ago. ""Think and Grow Rich"" would be a better selectionin my opinion.",0
"A major disappointment: I've been a major Ridley Scott fan since Alien - I'd watch anything he did. So Prometheus was the most anticipated of all his work and the first that I've considered a major let-down. It's a perfect example of less is more. Alien is on my top ten list of my all-time favorite movies and I could go on endlessly about how great that picture is - I won't. But its worth remembering how effective Alien is without the use of computer graphics, leaving the viewer to fill in what is not actually seen. Prometheus on the other hand is so overburdened with CGI that it becomes somewhat ridiculous and unbelievable. That's just me - I miss the old Ridley.",0
Nice i-phone Case: This is a high quality genuine leather case inside and out. I have purchased eight different leather cases for my i-phone and this is the only one that is actually leather along with the smell of leather. It holds the phone very securely. The flap is a bit cushiony which could protect the i-phone against accidental bumps. This is a great buy.,1
Impressed by WEN: A friend suggested this product so I researched the best deal and got it. I love the Tea Tree WEN shampoo and conditioner. My hair no longer frizzes even when it's misting outside and my scalp is no longer dry during the indoor winter heating season. I love it! Look forward to trying the other scents.,1

"Professional user only: This is one of the best sander I've used.I own fabrication shop and use many sanders like makita and porter-cable. If you are planning to use the sander more than 8 hours a day, then it is it.the only downside is (1) it is 30 percent heavier than the other (2) a lot of noise (3) some of the accessories are made in plastic. Older model were made with ALL metal.",1
Amazing Sound: I bought these after reading several reviews on Amazon. Some were not so flattering but I find these headphones amazing! Some of the performance comes from the fact that the phones have little rubber tips that seal the headphone in your ear canal. It sounds uncomfortable but the rubber is very thin and it really isn't. The phones come with a few spare tips of different sizes. I am listening to Tocata and Fugue in D minor at the moment and it is incredibly realistic. I would say that the base is strong but I think the response across the frequency spectrum is very good. I would be very happy even if I had paid twice as much.,1
High price/performance ratio: Fast SD card at low cost - works perfect - high speed - perfect for video camera's,1
"great on-the-go: This dictionary has the same definitions and words as my Merriam Webster, Home and Office Edition which I think is useful for those who are looking for a small, compact electronic dictionary. Some disadvantages- You can't upgrade it and you can't count on it replacing a large hardback dictionary.Its small enough to take anywhere and convenient on-the-go. No need to stop, figure out spelling, and turn to the right page. The vocabulary is sufficient and the pronunciation is okay. Although I have little use for the speaker, I found the pronunction a bit censored. It will not pronouced words such as anal, boob, or anything like that. Thats fine with me, I was checking to verify another reviewer's complaint. Overall everything else is satisfactory.",1
The best book on eBay so far!!!: I've read many books on eBay. This book has more useful advice than all the rest combined. The excellent research is evident throughout this easy-to-ready volume. This is not one of those books promising instant wealth from eBay. It is a practical how-to guide that covers all aspects of selling on Ebay. This book is valuable to eBay beginners and experienced eBay sellers alike. This is my first review. The excellence and utility of this book motivated me to take the time to share my thoughts on why all eBayers should own a copy.,1
"for the love of god, they aren't christian.: first of all, i have to say this is a great record, but it still pales in comparison to from the depths of dreams. lyrically, the songs aren't as strong, but their sound has definetly gotten harder. secondly, they arent christian. read their review on launch, as well as their review in ap. buddy, (along with the other members, i assume) is very well educated and knowledgeable of many religions and beliefs. even the name of the band is derived along those lines. so, if you're looking for a good screamo record, you've found it. if you're looking for a good screamo/christian record, try underoath's ""the changing of times.""",1
Mean Girls: The product meets expectations. Only downside was a few bite marks or teeth marks in the bottom corner. Disc came in perfect condition.,1
Extremely biased toward Muslims around the world.: This book is extremely biased toward Muslims not only in Pakistan but in America as well. As a Pakistani Muslim I totally do not agree with his point of view on Muslims in Pakistan. It is unfairly written from a biased person's point of view. The majority of the text written in the book is written totally without any knowledge of Islam.,0
"one of the better bandsin todays scene: Animosity is an awesome band.......and when i learned that none of the members were over 18 when this album was released, my jaw just dropped. For people at such a young age, these guys can PLAY!! Much better than others in the scene who are twice their age.I guess you could describe the music contained within this disc as pissed off, very heavy thrash with death metal vocals. The lyrics touch on everything from the government, religion, and personal woes. And the drums on this album have to be heard to be believed.......i dont know if they used a drum machine or not, but if the drummer is a real person............He must have like, eight arms!!!!!!!!! Check em out.",1

This mike DIES very easily!: We love the Karaoke revolution games - but we are on mics 5 & 6 - these have lasted longer than our previous ones as we duct taped them when new in hopes that the static would stay away. But BRAND new for Xmas...and within 2 weeks nothing but static on one mic and the other isn't picking up anyone's voice any more. Sony's Singstar game comes with mics that are way more sturdy (they have held up fine) - but the game is no where near as fun as Konami's Karaoke games! I wish logitech would fix it so the mics would have more lasting power!,0
"Courage...Commitment....Compassion: I don't understand how he does it, but Michael W Smith has amazingly communicated these feelings to his audience with a instrumental-only CD.

"""How I Brought Financial Ruin to the CBA"": I don't know if he wrote this book before or after he brought financial ruin to the CBA (The Continental Basketball Association), but this simple fact remains: a person who bought a 50 year old basketball league and drove it into bankrupcy in less than three years IS NOT QUALIFIED TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ""WINNING THE GAME OF BUSINESS"".",0
"A science book--not a history book-- for English majors: I thought this book was fascinating. Kolata never claimed that this was the definitive book on the flu in 1918, and mentioned Crosby all over the place. That's fine by me. The description of 1918 was so depressing I couldn't have kept reading it for much longer. What this book really is though is a history of 20th century science and politics. What resources did scientists have in the 1920s? The 1950s? Today? What does it mean for us? I stayed up late to finish this book, and admit that the ending left me aware of all that's unresolved. Maybe in a few years there would have been more info. Still, I enjoyed it very much. Others here have complained about excessive characterization of specific scientists, but to me that was the most compelling part. I want everything I read to help me think about how to live my life. I found the depictions of both courageous and cowardly bureaucrats, curious and smug scientists to be fascinating.",1

"heartbreaking: The tale of Owen and John brings to our dark, narrow field of vision a sweet glimmer of transcendence, of an eternity that is perhaps incomprehensible but ultimately caring. This is a marvelous and painful rumination on fate, certainly one of the most powerful stories I've ever read. The final page will leave you in tears, wishing for Owen's bright return to a disordered earth. Lovely.",1
"A prime example of timeless music....: Upon listening to ATCQ the first time, it caught my attention with its deliberate but easy flow. Reaching further and understanding the lyrics, it's clear that the group's message is about humanity.I'm relatively new to the hip-hop genre, and approach this music from a classical/jazz point of view. I find their production rhythmicly and auraly hypnotizing. Each group member blend their lyrics masterfully on each track.The Anthology is merely the tip of the iceburg of what ATCQ has to offer. I would make any newbies looking for real hip-hop to this listen to this album, then promptly make them get the rest of them.Musicality at this level will continue to live for years to come. Reaching the timeless plateau is certainly in reach, if it hasn't so already.",1
"Informative: It was rare for Hitch to do interviews and this is quite a good one. Definitely a must see if you are in any way a fan. I found his comments about film in the year 3000 with hypnotism being used quite fascinating. The only weakness is the ""interviewer"" who seems to be very pleased with himself and speaks in a effected and cockamamie television interviewer voice that grates on you after awhile. It also could have been longer. But Hitch is the reason to see this and as always he delivers. On a sidenote there is some very cool footage of Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery on the set of Marnie in this and one segment where Hitch discusses the tricks of editing(they cut from Hitch smiling and looking at a mother and her child to Hitch smiling again the same way but this time a cut to a young woman in a bikini)left me laughing hysterically.",1
"One tough cookie: This show was a good one, Mike Hammer; private eye. He solves cases and makes time for his favorite girl- Besty, his gun. The show brought to the small screen humor, some action, and still seemed to keep some of that 1950's style of being a private eye in the 1990's.",1

"Asenath - NOT!: As an Israeli and a ""name freak"", I found the authors' editorializing approach nearly offensive. Who are they to decree whether a name is a ""girls' name"" or a ""boys' name"", or ""in"" or ""uncool""? These ""facts"" change about yearly.In addition, their knowledge of Hebrew is spotty at best, which can be dangerous. For instance, they tell you that Asenath is a Biblical name, but do they tell readers that in Hebrew it's pronounced ""oh-SNOT""? I found other similar but no less annoying misinformation as well. I recommend going Beyond Rosenkrantz and Satran...to other sources.",0

"How Long Before Bill O'Reilly Apologizes to the Nation?: In the build up to the war with Iraq, Bill O'Reilly was on television every night backing up Bush's whoppers. Like the White House team, O'Reilly assured us that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. On March 18, 2003, O'Reilly was on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" He made the following promise about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction:""If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean, he has nothing, I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush Administration again, all right?""It's time for Bill O'Reilly to apologize to the nation and tell us that he no longer trusts the Bush Administration.

"This album alone could be The Kinks Greatest Hits: The Kinks finest album. Ray Davies makes you FEEL his lyrics through his drunken cry. Nothing hits harder than listening to ""Alcohol"" the morning after a night of one too many drinks. Overall the album has a much more bluesy/folksy/southern rock feel to it than their other albums, but Dave Davies guitar playing is much more raw, almost flawed, which just adds to the amazing atmosphere this album contains.",1

"Difficult to tune, TV and SW bands don't seem to work: I use this to listen to the news in the shower. It's adequate for that purpose, but the TV and SW bands have never seemed to work. It's also very difficult to tune as the indicator is almost invisible. Nobody expects audiophile quality in a cheap pocket radio, so it's no surprise that the loudspeaker is good only for AM news and talk shows. The mono sound is decent enough for music if you use headphones or ear buds.",0

When I called Magnavox they offered to exchange it for another one for $249.00 plus shipping. I paid $265.00 for a new one last year. Magnavox does not stand behind their name. Either buy an extended warranty on this product or do not buy it. I will never buy Magnavox again!",0
"Great design, easy to use, may lack power.: This is a beautifully designed accessory and is very easy to use. Only downside I have come across is a lack of power, I feel like the radio on it could be a little bit stronger resulting in cleaner performance. The built in usb charger is a great feature.",1
"Presto Multi-Cooker: This is the second Presto Multi-cooker I have had. The first one was wonderful, but after having it for about 7 years, I dropped it and broke a plastic foot off. Instead of trying to replace it, I bought a new cooker.The new one is very similar, the only difference being the temperature control. Whereas the control on the first one was fantastic, the new control is not nearly as good. For example, if I set the temp of the first control on 212 deg (boiling), water in the pot did just that, it boiled very slowly. Other temp setting were also good.The new control is very different. In order to adjust to just boiling, one has to set the control way down into ""Warm"" and the only way to get a temp you want is to just play with it. The numbers on the control mean nothing other than higher numbers give higher temps.Other than the problem with the new control, the new cooker is just as good at the old one. Identical, in fact.",0
"One of the worst movies ever made: This is definatly a waste of money and time. The only thing worse than the acting is the writting. Rather than make a good action movie with decent writting, John Woo tryings to impress people with numerous explosions. At least 4 helicopters explode when the would not have in reality; one is shot down with a handgun, another starts leaking fuel for no reason (which is imediatly ignited by another gun), etc. I would not recomend this to anyone, under any circumstances. This is bad, even for a John Travolta flim.",0
"True Teenage Talent...: During the late 80's, the teenage pop era was at its peak. Included in this movement along with New Kids on the Block and Tiffany, was Debbie Gibson. While the two ladies battled for surpremecy at the top of the charts, they both belted out many a great tune. The only difference is that Ms. Gibson wrote her the majority of her own material, and what a fantastic job she did. Many of her hits include ""Electric Youth,"" ""Only In My Dreams,"" and ""Out of the Blue,"" all included here. As well the beautiful piano piece ""Lost In Your Eyes,"" my fav, is found here as well. This greatest hits package covers her first three albums and is an excellent showcase of her early career. I recommend this to anyone who is a child of the 80's and can't help ""Losin' Myself"" in memories every time I pop this disc into my player.",1
"Dreamfall is a Terrible Game: Sure, Dreamfall has beautiful grahics, settings, characters, and a mostly interesting story. So why is it terrible? Because it is NOT a game - it's a movie! Most of it is long, long, long cutscenes and dialog. The few puzzles it has are really bad. The exploring is extremely linear despite open-looking geography. The game essentially tells you what to do in most situations and, worse yet, it often actually does it for you! This game is nothing like true adventure games (such as the Monkey Island series, or the old King Quest series, or any good old Sierra game.) If you want to watch movies, fine. But if you want to play an adventure game, forget it.",0
"A pleasing addition to the sense of Design: A very comprehensive book full of pictures of everything it covers. All aspects of design are covered from floors, walls, colors, furniture, accessories .. etc. All rooms of a house are featured and very detailed explanations are with each picture. Many new ideas that are actually feasable. A beautiful book for anyone who is planning a new house or just renovating an existing one (like me). I Particularly liked the mix of colors and the various ideas for the floors. This is a excellent addition to my decor library.",1
"More than a common procedural: Before watching this show, I had absolutely no idea of Swedish history, the war between Swede and Russia, or the influence of the French Revolution on other People. I hadn't even thought about it.After watching the show, I'm glad to say I've actually learned some of historical facts. Obviously, the purpose of the show is not a lesson in history.The historical facts, combined with the criminal inquiries and a love story, make the show a unique one. The characters are well written, the actors good... What's not to like ?",1
"Not worth it: The quality of the materials is very good. However, the craftsmanship was very bad. The corners will not even line up and only one side is actually straight. It would be disrespectful to my family in Slovakia to display or fly this flag.",0
Oxo Good Grips Y Peeler: I abosolutely love this peeler. It is the best I have ever used. It has weight to it that others don't have and fits comfortably in your hand. It feels so well-balanced!,1
This is terrible: Not even worth the $.99 I paid for it. Really bad. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because I didn't find any spelling errors in the first 20 pages. Very poorly written with cardboard cut out characters in ridiculous situations.,0
"Interesting Read: I had ordered several books on the subject not knowing exactly what went on. I read the other reviews before making the purchase and have to agree that it is a fair and balanceed account of the scandal. After all these years, you have to wonder what else can be said and what other information can be dug up? The author does a fantastic job without making it sleazy or a questionable read. If you are interested in the subject matter, this is a great place to start. Kind of got interested from ""Kings Speech"" and went back with the whole Royal History thing and Jack The Ripper. Have to say - A little bit of everything for everyone.",1
"Polarized Opinion at its Finest: Being a politically interested citizen I have delved into the current swarm of political rants flooding the book stores both praising and demonizing Bush and have come to the same conclusion about this book as ""Unfit for Command"" (perhapse the least credible of the lot). If you really do believe Bush to be an able, clear-headed, ""compassionate"" leader then you will probably find Matter of Character compelling and affirming of your views as well as a reasonably engaging read. The sources are articulated in a clear enough fasion for political literature and nothing is ground-breaking enough to necessitate any truly inspirational journalism. On the other hand if you believe Bush to be an elitist, simple-minded bully, cowing to a manipulative old-boy network then you will fundamentally dissagree with not only the marginally researched basis of this book but its conclusions as well.",0
"Wonderful Album: Well iam going to make this as clear as possible,this is quite possibly one of the best albums i have purchased this year.40 Below Summer has really come a long way from their first album.Being a guitar player myself I pay more attention to the music,and all i can say is the Guitar on this album is a lot more well written then Ivitation To The Dance.This album has a perfect combination of slow ballads,and hardcore epics.This album is a must have.",1
"This does not deserve a rating of 4.5 stars.: I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clich√©d classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only.An indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the Pitchfork Media website...I can't post the link due to strict review guidelines.",0
"inexpensive for a reason, buy a better product: The product leaks, I previously owned a pampered chef model which included a rubber ring to seal the moisture inside.

"worst movie ever!: this movie has to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! it is very low budget, and just about everything about it sucks and is just all around stupid and worhtless and i hate it!i admit that this movie may look interesting, but is definetely not even worth viewing. i rented both this movie and the sequel, and they both blow. the sequel is a little bit better, but still low budget and horrible. so in other words this movie is not worth watching, unless you want to laugh at how bad it is. and it IS NOT SCARY AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"good coverage but Cingular style antics: Cingular offers the best coverage in San Diego and probably southern California. We only used 350 of the 550 because most of our friends also have cingular (free m2m). After reviewing our bill we had over 3000 minutes combined or about 2cents a minute. The only cons i see are that 1) Cingular will be raising the sms from 10 to 15 cent. Total ripoff! 50% increase wow! 2) the first month you need to pay in advance. I at first did not understand, but I took a long look at the bill and talked to CS to clear everything up (when our service is over I will only be paying taxes and any additional chargess).",1
"Did I get the right thing?: I received this product and cannnot believe that it retails for $119.00. There must be some mistake. This product is a standard bag (no bigger than a ziploc freezer bag) of ""blocks"". I paid $5.77 for it on clearance and honestly would have sent it back if it would not have cost me half of that to mail it back. I have not bothered to even open it. Had planned to give it as a gift to my son for x-mas. It's not even worth being a stocking stuffer! There's nothing MEGA about it. Sooooooo disappointed.",0
Get's The Job Done: This sharpener is very easy to use and definitely gets my knives sharp. I haven't had them sharpened in over a decade and this machine did it quickly and professionally. It was easy to use as long as you read the manual. It is loud but when you think about what it's accomplishing I can ignore the noise. American's Test Kitchen liked it and so do I.,1

"Just Another Sexist Male Fantasy: First of all, the Russian women fighter pilots were never a secret. And second, the true stories of the courageous women are interesting in and of themselves. Why do we need another sexist-male-ain't-never-gonna-happen fantasy? Lilya Litviak had the short dramatic life that Hollywood dreams about. Her father was executed as an enemy of the state during the Purge. Lilya had to keep this secret or face banishment from society, not to mention flying, which she loved. Was posthumously awarded Russia's highest honor. She went from enemy of the state to Hero of the Soviet Union in about 5 short years. She was 22 years old when she died. Why can't we just tell the truth?",0
"Emerald - Lauren Royal: Lauren Royal does it again with the second book in the Jewel Triology, Emerald. Once again she takes us away to Restoration England. Jason Chase, the hero, and Caithren Leslie, the heroine, are great. You will root for them the whole book through. Just like a true romance, misunderstandings grow into obstacles to overcome, but there are plenty of surprises and twists along the way.",1
"A COMPLETE ABOMINATION!: First off, I absolutely LOVE Night Of The Living Dead! It is a classic. Unfortunately, I just had the bad luck of seeing the 30th Anniversary Edition of Night Of The Living Dead on Cinemax and was completely appalled at... this classic film [edition]. Fortunately, all I wasted was a few minutes... I honestly had to check the TV guide to make sure I was on the right channel...The second thing that shook me was... [the] music score that completely detracted from the eerie feeling that the original film so brilliantly conveyed. I will be honest; I couldn't even sit through this...I am just glad to see that I am not alone in my... [disappointment]...",0
Big disappointment.: I've read ever Oprah pick and was very disappointed in this one. I felt the characters were weak and uninteresting and the plot was too predictable. I didn't feel any of the characters were likeable and was very happy when I finished the book. I'm beginning to get the feeling that Oprah isn't actually reading these before they are recommended!!!!,0
"nice and: A Decent card for the price. This is one of the FEW products I will use by the linksys people.Thinking of buying an internet ""router"" (internet connection sharing gizmo) by linksys? think again.. go buy one from NetGear.I bought two of these cards for spare machines.

"the photograph: It is meretricious pap like this that threatens the good name of the vaunted Booker prize, once bestowed on its author.This contrived tale of a found photo brings together some of the least likeable caricatures of the contemporary English in print. Aside from the opportunity to show off the Latin names of some very ordinary plants and to riff briefly on the history of landscape, the author has woven a predictable and dreary tale of lovelessness better suited to the Ladies Home Journal (if it still prints short stories) than to hard or soft-cover.",0
"Best So Far: Normally, every book in the series is about equal. This is the first book that really stands out.Plum is of course as good in this one as normal. It is nice to see Ranger having a bigger part in this book that earlier ones. He doesn't just show up to save the day, but works with Stephanie quite a bit. The addition of Kloughn to the regular cast of characters is welcomed. He definitely falls on the hapless side of her friends.The bad guys are more entertaining in this book that previous as well. The guy in the rabbit suit is, well, interesting. He seems as dangerous as any of the people who have tried to kill her in the past, but more interesting.The story is about what we've come to expect from the series. Through a series of luck breaks and coincidences, Plum stumbles her way through to success. Hapless but effective.This book is as funny as any of its' predecessors, and a little more interesting. For fans of the series, I would definitely recommend it.",1

"Easy setup and flawless operation: This HDTV receiver looks great and is nice and compact. The user interface is very easy to navigate. Setup is quick and easy. Auto program of over the air channels took about a minute. I have it connected to a UHF/VHF antenna with preamp mounted in the attic. This receiver found 25 DTV channels, some as far away as Baltimore (I'm in Northern Virginia, so about 50 miles away).The remote is simple and easy to use. My only gripe with the remote is it cannot be programmed to control the tv (not universal). Not a big deal though. No problems with boot up time or lag time while switching channels. I have the receiver connected to my Toshiba LCD HDTV via an HDMI -> DVI cable. Picture quality is as good as it was on Verizon Fios, better if you consider that OTA is free!",1
"Absolutely fantastic!: In Dusk, The The have achieved yet another masterpiece.The lyrics are as usual moving, thought-provoking and catchy, the music is wonderful and varied, while still unmistakably The The and seems to flow from one track to the next beautifully.I have had this album since it was released in '93, and it is still right up near the top of my playlist. All of the tracks are exceptional, with no fillers. If I had to commit to a favourite The The album, it would be either this one (Dusk) or Soul Mining (although there are several others which are unlucky to be left off).For those of you who are The The fans who might not have this album, for goodness sake, GET IT! If you have heard only one or two of their songs and think they sound at least ok, this is a great album from which to get thoroughly addicted!",1
"UGGHH!!!!: I would have given this book zero stars if I could. Honestly, I do not know why I keep going back to reading the Saddle Club books, maybe I just keep hoping I'll find something measurable to Bonnie Bryant's later Pine Hollow series. Though I certainly wasn't expecting anything like that from this book. But it actually fell far below my expectations.All the characters seemed like a bunch of really bad actors. What is with that?! There was not a genuine moment throughout the entire book. And how many times can Bonnie Bryant use the same stupid cliches over and over again? For example, it seems like every book that takes place at a riding camp ends with the predictable event of a barn fire, and of course, as always, no one is hurt or killed. This book was really just a big mess, and frankly, I do not think it is at all necessary to explain the history of the American Quarter horse during an attempt to rescue a herd of horses from a barn fire. I would not recommend this book to anyone.",0
"The Gingerbread Man: This book arrived on time in good condition, and we are thoroughly enjoying the book with our granddaughter. We would definitely buy from this source again. Thank you.",1
"A Good Idea gone Bad: Don't get me wrong, I love 'The Stray Cats' and 'Motorhead' but this CD does not work for me. Lemmy is by no means an outstanding singer but within Motorhead, his vocal style works and could not be replaced. I expected this album to be along this line: Full-force power versions of old Rock'n'Roll classics, especially having Slim Jim being part of the project. But instead, they try to stay very close to the originals and this is where Lemmy's voice just doesn't cut it. There is no track that stands out so better save your money and buy Motorhead's 'Rock'n'Roll' album instead !",0
"I was a little dissapointed: When I ordered the movie I thought it would be in English, because the movie was already out in English at the time. The Sub is still good, just not what I was expecting.",0
"some facts, some blue sky: This book has a seductive title, and the author takes one through countless examples of the sun actually being a great source of energy. the author depends on trite phrases rather than science to make or prove his assertions. Enjoyable reading because of a quick and exciting style, but lacking in substance. I get sick of phrases like...""some scientists say""..and ""many experts agree"".....the question is who agrees and when did they agree? A stopped clock is right twice a day, as one of my old Yale professors did say. So too with this book.Thanks you for the opportunity to express my opinion.Jack FlobeckChairmanAqua Prima Center Inc.think tank for water research.",0
"The HOLY GRAIL of fitness DVDs: This video is the best - you get alot for your money, because 6 fifteen minute segments - 90 minutes. There are 2 programs each for your abs, legs, and arms. Each program is challenging and effective (especially the 2nd Abs program!!!). Try it out on a day that you don't have to walk the next day! The sumo-squats in the Legs program one are a killer!! The DVD is great, because you can pick and choose what parts you want to work out. I like to do one program from each category. I love Tamilee Webb because her cueing is right on and she is serious, but also fun to watch and listen to.... not annoying (like some other video instructers). This is a staple in my workout DVD collection.",1
"The AI level is disappointing: I am not a chess master but I played quite a bit as a child/teen. After I read an interview from the firm that developped this game (""a robust AI"") I was not expecting a first rate program but at least a good one. What a disappointment!! Even at the highest level, the opening library of the program is close to 0, the level during the game is low-average with some strange and bad moves from time to time.If you like chess and expect the level of an average chess computer program, do NOT buy this game, you will be disappointed. If you are a chess beginner, this game could do the trick provided that you do not progress too quickly!I also tested the on-line gaming and there was no human opponent... The AI proposed to play but the level here was really low.",0

"Great writer, great laughs, great book!: Alcohol abuse has always seemed to be handled with sadness in literature, film, music, etc, but for Burroughs - everything dark turns into dark humour.It's amazing that he can write about such a terrible time in his life with a smirk on his face. - He doesn't leave anything out, however humiliating (like coming home from rehab and finding hundreds of bottles of booze lying around that he hadn't noticed when he had been drinking!) scary (when he wakes up in an abandoned house in a bad part of town and has no idea where he is) Whilst Running with Scissors seemed to lag a bit in places, this will keep you hooked till the end.If you like reading about true life stories that will make you laugh, cry, laugh some more, feel sick, cringe, and laugh even MORE, then you'll totally dig this book.",1
"Mucolyxir Liquid: Unfortunately this product did not seem to be effective. My husband only used one bottle, but there seemed to be no positive change in his symptoms.",0

Not researched well enough to really do that much good.: I wasn't that impressed with this book although I agree wholeheartedly with her message. A very sloppy effort on her part.,0
I don't really know what to rate this book: I would have liked this book if I had read it when I were say 5. My English teacher read it to my 7th grade class and even though it was a really funny book I thought that it was too young for thirteen year olds.Now...I didn't have anything agianst the book because I thought that it was a good book. I'm just saying that as a 7th grader it wasn't the best but for younger kids it is perfect.,1
"Trojan Odyssey: I've enjoyed Cussler's books in the past. (although his recent penchant for including himself in a cameo appearance in his novels is a little bizaar!) I did not care for this latest effort. In fact after reading about 1/4 of the book I just closed it up and said ""Nope, I'm not going to waste my time with this drivel. Seems like he wrote it just to meet a deadline. Nothing new or exciting really. So, I'm thinking Cussler is off my list of authors to seek out for awhile.",0
"Good for beginners, but not an advanced piece.: As a student of ecopsychology, I picked up this work expecting to find in depth discussions about theories in psychology and ecopsychology. I was already familiar with many of the concepts discussed in this book- vision quests, psychedelics, shamanism, and the like. So in all honesty, I was not too thrilled or dazzled.If you are new to the subject, this is a good introduction. For someone studying this a while and is familiar with these concepts, I would point the readers to Ecopsychology: Restoring the Earth, Healing the Mind. The author contributes to this excellent anthology.",0
"Better than I expected: Originally I expected to have greater special effects, some better acting, but a few screw-ups. That and I thought it was going to be a real rip-off of 28 days later, but with some creative staff they prevented that problem. This is one of the few new ""horror movies"" that had any reaction out of me, but from other people I saw they were ready to fill their shorts. I liked the cameo from Tom Savini, the more in-depth approach to the zombies, and some good character development. This has enough to satisfy just about everyone, and will keep the die hard fans salivating for more.",1

"Terrible. This book is an exact reprint of Witch Doctor.: If you already own Witch Doctor on Wall Street, don't waste your time with this new one. It is an exact copy of ""The Witch Doctor On Wall Street"". Not a refrasing, mind you, but an exact duplicate. What a fraud. The only thing different are some updated graphs; a few extra footnotes; a short prologue, which is just a summary of the chapters; and the Epilogue. This constitutes about 20 pages of new material. Prometheus Books and Dr. Parks should be ashamed to call this a new book.",0

The demonstrations for the pool, and open water are well shot, and well narrated so you know exactly what is happening, and why it's important. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because alot of things can go wrong swimming in open water, and these situations were not discussed much.",1

Party Monster is amazing.: The disk was perfect-didnt skip once. There was no damage on the case either.... I would buy from this seller again.,1
"An empiricist history: This book is about the ten best stock market years of the 20th century. I didn't expect any miraculous set of pointers on identifying a great stock market year. However, one expects a historian to do more merely than report discrete facts. One would expect a set of common threads running through the descriptions of these ten years, explaining their similarities and differences. Instead, what one sees is like brief snippets of market-related events in each of the years (and some unrelated events too), with no coherent narrative.I admit I couldn't bring myself to read it all. I stopped and skipped to the last Epilogue that tries to sum things up (too late). That was brief and unsatisfactory.Not a book I'd recommend to any audience for any purpose.",0
"Star Wars: Episode I: I bought this as a replacement for my Star Wars DVD Set which was lost in a house fire. Although I have not yet watched this DVD, it looks to be in excellant condition. It was shipped in short order and I will not hesitate to order from Amazon.com in the future.",1
"It was easily forgotten...: I read this book about a year ago. The book was not that good to me. I found it juvenile, immature, easily forgotten. It was not exciting and barely kept my interest, and I actually found it corny. Especially the ending.

"Worst Motorcyle Book I have Read So Far: I read the whole thing thinking there would be a point or conclusion somewhere. There isn't. The author rambles around like she can't make up her mind whether she wants to write about motorcycle history, psychological problems. love life, or travel. At no point is their any insight into why riders ride. If your looking for this go somewhere else. There is nothing useful here.When reading about areas I am very familiar with I noted several gross errors. This makes me wonder what other things are in the book that are not factual.Spend you money for another book.",0
Watcb David Lean's 1946 version: I barely recognized Dickens' great story. Everything about this version was off. It was difficult watching Gillian Anderson's vapid portrayal of Miss Havisham; Herbert Pocket was a shell of his charming self; Mr. Wemmick is practically non-existent and his 'Aged P' makes no appearance whatsoever. It was depressing and dark.Don't waste your time with this version and rent David Lean's excellent and entertaining version. You might end up buying it and watching it over and over to see how what a gem it is.,0
Pieces too weak: The cord snapped within 10 minutes of my 10 year old son's first go - he retied but then it snapped twice more in different spots. This was on the grass so nothing present to cut or rip the cord. The screw piece (for the ground) is also poorly made with the soldered bit splitting off easily (though it still functions it means a slightly exposed sharp edge). The handheld cord seems fine so far!,0
"Well worth it...: I don't often write reviews. I read them with each purchase and normally I don't feel the need to contradict others. I found that Bruce Bain's ""pretend you never seen one before..."" to be chilidish and absolutely off the mark. I am an art student and art appreciation major. When I first went to art class I was self-taught without instruction. This was a good thing. My first professor advised the class ""Everything you learned before now forget. You learned it that wrong way! I will teach you the right way"". It is just like this that the artist is telling you to forget your preconceived notions and look at subjects with a fresh eye. I picked up this book in the book store and ending up reading ten pages standing in the aisle before I knew it. Its a marvelous find. I highly recommend. I've always had problems drawing the human form and this was immensly helpful.",1
"Useless!: Sportbrain is now out of business! This pedometer does not work if it is not registered at their website, which does not exist anymore! Don't waste your money.",0
"has some problems: I received one of these as a Christmas gift a few years ago. While I prefer the thermal carafe style machines, I can't recommend this one. Like most lower end machines, the brew temperature is too low and the coffee doesn't taste right.Another problem is that the overflow is desgned to go back into the reservoir. Most people won't run into this problem. I did because I was using a #10 SwissGold filter basket in it. That particular basket is not cone shaped and the coffee needs to flow out the sides.This exacerbates another problem which is that most coffee makers aren't designed for brewing fresh coffee. There isn't much extra room under the shower head. The stale canned stuff would probably work okay but fresh ground, freshly roasted beans bloom when water first contacts them. I tried to make a strong pot with some freshly roasted beans and had huge mess on my hands. That was too much to deal with before my morning coffee.",0
Awesome!: This book is Fabulous! One of the best fantasy series I've ever read. Its over addictive...impossible to put down. Great!,1
"What a piece of junk: This album is very popular among high school students and some stupid college kids. It is not the greatest album in the world being both musically complex and great. It is instead a mere pop album and I think it sucks. If you want to listen to what everyone else likes, buy this album, if not, DON'T.",0
Great piano music: Great music if you like classical piano. It took forever for them to ship it though.,1
"Product was defective: When I got the shuffler, I put batteries in and went to play cards with some friends. We loaded the cards, and only one side of the shuffler worked. So I returned it. I will have to go thru the hassle of getting another one. Hopefully, the next one works.",0
"VPM: It's hideous, it has no on-DVD printing (it looks blank),it has no quality whatsoever (except the quality of the playing/viewing); I would've prefer to throw my money into the toilet and see it flush!!",0
Supreme Music for Peace: Fragrances of a Dream is an outstanding piece of music for awakening deep peace and serenity.,1
"Put Borat out of it's misery!: If you gave a group of boys, aged 10 - 12, a couple of million dollars and the freedom to make any film they wanted, Borat would be it!I'm not a prude. I grew up with the off-color humor of Redd Foxx and Belle Barth. They were FUNNY!Borat is simply sophomoric, crude, and rude, pretending to be satire.View this dog at your own peril!",0
Awesome product -- FAST shipping: Easy to use and well worth the money. Very reasonably priced. I have aquariums and this unit helps me keep my water parameters where they need to be. Shipping was FAST and the product arrived in perfect shape. Would order again from this seller.,1
"It's Raffan: Certainly not a ""first book"", but certainly a solid book for someone still on the learning curveRichard covers all the basics, a lot of great ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" and wonderful options.If you want to bet a good grounding in ""boxes"" this is the book for youNote: Turned ""boxes"" are round or oval (with special chucks), not square",1
love it!: I love these so much! They were easy to put together and they look great in my house. I would definitely recommend these bar stools. They are half the price of the same ones in Target.,1
"Wondeful and Warm: This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for a while because I passed it over for other newer books... How sorry I am I waited this long! This book is so good... the stories about the different dogs are heartwarming, and heartwrenching...they are filled with almost any dog immaginable and are a delight to read especially for dog lovers. I can't recommend this book enough...",1
"Too much filler and written too quickly with shallow plot: I've decided to avoid PF Hamilton novels after a few bad experiences with his later works. Esp that last novel in the Nights Dawn Trilogy. He spent hundreds of pages setting up the excitement for it to be all neatly tidied up by using a ""God"" like machine that was in no way different than a big Genie granting your every wish. Nothing science fiction about it. This novel introduces some interesting science but does not use any of it in an interesting way. Devices are used and created without effort or exploration of their effects. The many many characters are too numerous for them all to become worth worring about. The aliens are too alien and thus hardly require any moral qualms about their inevitable demise. Peter in fact tries too hard to make them unlovable. His normal anti social tendencies of giving everyone in power the lowest morals is dreary and unsuprising. In summary this novel is a drag. Stay clear.",0
"too heavy and bulky: This pogo stick is much too heavy, stiff, and bulky. It is very difficult to jump on because of this. I had to return it for my 14 year old son who is normally very coordinated. Not so with this item.",0
"Good idea, not quality!: I was so thrilled to finally find something that would fit my large and small valuable ornaments. I bought these last year after Xmas, but when I retrieved them this year, all of the clips that hold the stacks together broke! Now, I have separate bins that are uncovered because the lids can't be latched down, and the handles are on the lids, so they cannot be stacked and hauled around. They won't last one year, so they're junk!",0
"good headphones, but heavy: These are good headphones for the money. Audio quality is very good, and I am happy with the sound quality. These are not really comfortable with glasses on. The headphones are a little heavy, and the cord is long and heavy. Definitely not a portable pair of headphones. I am using them to listen to music at home, so this is not a problem for me. If you are looking for headphones to carry with you opt for something else.I would recommend these headphones as a sturdy pair for home use.",1
Perfect for 2 microphones: I use it to hold 2 AKG 480 microphones.SUPER STRONG CASE yet small!I would buy more if I needed them,1

"Impressive Bag: Ordered bag for my 10"" netbook. Fits with room to spare! My 13"" white macbook fits perfect. Plenty of pockets for adapter and external dvd drive. The outside pocket holds my Thermos Nissan 2456P 18-Ounce Stainless-Steel Hydration Bottle perfectly. I ordered the Dr. Pepper color and I love the little bit of sparkle in the red color. I don't usually leave reviews but was SO happy with this bag I had to leave a review.",1
"From the bizarre to the ridiculous: This book reveals the most incredulous storyline I have ever read and believe me that says I lot becuase over the years I've read thousands of books. How could a mild-mannered, ordinary accountant be transformed into a thoughlessly cruel serial killer? How could his wife - a mother and seemingly kind and thoughtful person, time after time, condone his actions? It is a page turner because we want to see who he is going to kill next and what bizarre actions will follow-not because it is a well-written, positively thought-provoking read.Thumbs down x 5 for this one!!!!!!",0

A Powerman Wannabe: Its another band like Powerman 5000. They all look the same and sound the same. They are all like tredy metal now a days. But if you like powerman 5000 buy the cd. you will like it. I saw them live and they do put on a good show but i just don't like powerman 5000. Buy it and see for yourself.,0

"The whys of suicide: Sharon McCone's brother Joey commits suicide, and the death ties in to a case involving another suicide, that of a young man who was maybe harassed to death by an online magazine. The plot thickens as McCone delves into the shenanigans at the magazine, as well as in the life of the family who has hired her. Nobody is particularly likeable, here. It's actually a lot more entertaining on some levels than Marcia Muller's usual stuff. I liked it a lot.",1
best band ever: this band is inspiring with an upbeat tempo you cant help but love after 5 years i can still press play sit back and let the music take you away. you wont regret buying this cd cadet is awesomenessmusic is reminiscent of relient k and the offspringcadet pwnes all else,1
"yuke: a terrible design with a weak fence that can't stay true, non standard miter slot so shallow that nearly impossible to make a cross cutting sled, dado cutting very limited needs viagra to get wider cuts.

According to the service people at the Apple Store it wasn't a good fit with the iPod's port, it bent a wire out of shape inside, and ruined my iPod. Buy the Apple recharger instead.",0
"Clearly a Must Read for the Spiritual Seeker: If you want to take your understanding of life and the human psyche a giant step beyond the traditional confines of textbook psychology, sociology and philosophy, this book is definitely a must read. It tells you a great deal about yourself and your personality. The book provides insight and precious advice as to how you can work on (and with) your primary life lessons in order to lead a better life. If I were to set up a favourite-book list from my large library, this one would definitely be among them. I can also strongly recommend Steve Rother's other books.",1
"Massimo e` il Massimo! He's the very best: It has been said of Massimo Ranieri that he lives his music. I agree. For me he is to singing what Giacomo Puccini was to composing. From the time he was a young man, his magnificent voice flew threw the air like Apollo in the classic Greek plays. Now that he is older, we still feel his enduring passion for song, his unending passion for life. This album demonstrates his growth from a very talented young man to the well-seasoned, incredible performer that he is today. If you love melody, if you love masterful singing, if you love beauty itself, this album is a must-have.",1
"enjoyable read: Well! The first three chapters I felt were very slow - to be honest I even wondered whether I would finish the book however - all of a sudden the book hits you with action, magic, war, master vampires, betrayal, ghosts the lot - turned out to be a really good read and i've ordered the next book - not as good as Anita Blake but an ejoyable read anyway",1
not original recordings: on these cds you cannot play short excerpts from the songs.this is how i can tell the quality of a cd. i just purchased 2 frankie valli and the four seasons cds and they are excellant remasters of the otiginal songs.,0
"tried too much: Aalyah's new self-titled album is big on trying out new cutting edge sounds, but not big on making great songs. Most Aaliyah fans who liked the lead single ""We Need A Resolution,"" will probably like #3 ""Rock the Boat"" and #6 ""Care For You"" which are slow songs. They are actual flowing songs, which are a rarity on this disk, which is filled with so many music and temo changes, that you can't tell if the song is supposed to make you dance or cry. The one good thing about the disk is that it shows off Aaliyah's vocal talent more than anything she's done before, and while she'll never be a diva it shows that she is a more than competent singer. I give the album 2 stars because it is groundbreaking, but it shows me that sometimes it's just good to stick to your past formula.",0
works great: I bought this a couple of years ago after purchasing another brand. I could not hear the other person well enough with the other brand. Not a problem with this one and continues to work well.,1
"The most underrated movie of all time: I don't remember seeing the trailer for this movie, or remember it coming to the theaters. A friend of mine told me it was worth watching so I rented it, then bought it, and have watched it about 5 times over the past 2 years. It is one of my all time favorite movies. It's amazing how a movie of this caliber can get so overlooked.",1
"A Good Workout: In typical Denise fashion, I always feel energized after completing 2 of the workouts. A couple of the transitions are slightly awkward, otherwise, a good workout.",1
"Inconsistent Readings: We've had this scale for over a year. My son (~115 lb) has been using it for the last several months and we've found that it has not been consistent, especially in the past few weeks. Even when placed on a very hard tile floor, rather than a linoleum floor, the readings vary by as much as 2 lb with repeated measurements, depending on the ""mood"" of the scale.",0
Could I please just this once give it zero stars: I remember overpaying for this movie at a budget double feature--I think I paid $2.00. This was literally the most painful movie to watch. It was like receiving the clockwork orange treatment regarding movies to the point that you wanted to fall to your knees gagging. The argument that maybe its so bad its good doesn't work. This movie is smallpox. This movie is the plague. Filled with scenes of Kurt Thomas using a pummel horse routine to launch a mighty gymnastic attack against village crazies is not a motivation to view this film. It is easily the worst movie ever made.,0
"Not the same FACE TO FACE: I remember when this was released, FACE TO FACE was one of my favorite bands. DON'T TURN AWAY, to this day is still one of my favorite albums ever made. This is not the same style of music at all. The fast, melodic style of 90's west coast skater-hardcore is gone. This is a ""grown up"" album full of slower, moody rock which is a major departure from their earlier material. To me, it was a major disappointment. Some of the songs are still good, but this band should have a different name, it's not FACE TO FACE after this record.",0
"Sub-standard farce: With a long-winded, fragmented plot and badly drawn, one- dimensional characters, Small World is a truly dreadful book. Lovers of Tom Sharpe books might find this woeful account of conference-trotting academics interesting but anybody else should steer well clear. Awful.",0
"Great read and resource!: How lovely it is to have a book that gives so muchinsight into the person themselves! We find much outabout the man himself (Count Fersen) from reading hisown thoughts written in letters to his father and othersand from their letters to him. This book is definitelywell worth the read and to have as a resource on thehappenings during the French and American Revolution.If I had it to do all over again, I would buy thehard cover edition though. My front and back coverto the book, while in excellent condition when firstreceived, began to curl back as soon as it hit themoist, humid, subtropical air here in Florida. I'venever had a book do that quite so quickly before.",1
"Firefly - My Heart of Gold: I watched this on Fridays when FOX first aired it. I rented the whole series from NETFLIX. I have asked for the DVD box set for Christmas. FOX should of shown them in the order that the DVD's are in it would have made more sense. The unaired episodes are some of the best. ""Heart of Gold"" is my favorite. Please buy these. Go see the movie ""Serenity"" and buy the DVD on December 20, 2005. Can't Take my sky from me...I found Serenity",1
"I just kept reading and couldn't stop!!: Okay, so ""Outlander"" was wonderful...I read it in about two days...I had bought ""Dragonfly In Amber"" and ""Voyager"" along with it so once I was finished with one I could start the next. Four days later and no sleep...I finished the three. I loved ""outlander""...but this book grabbed me. I just could not put this down! Granted, there are some very graphic parts to these books, but, if you love the historical aspect and the descriptions of the times, you will fall in love. I laughed, I cried, I cringed, I sighed...I am in a full run to buy the next two!!",1
"Why would one want this?: Why anyone would spend $500+ on this is beyond me. The cool thing about reverse macro work is that the mount is irrelevant (filter threads are universal, after all). What makes this universality especially nice is that there's a plethora of excellent used lenses from many manufacturers available for very little money. It perplexes me why one would need to reverse a specific EF lens. Just get a superb old Canon FD lens, or Nikkor, or Olympus Zuiko, or Pentax SMC, etc...That being said, I've tried this on a whim in a camera store, and it does work quite well (hence the two stars). But upon arriving home, I popped my old 50mm f/1.4 FD reversed onto my 1Ds Mark II and shot some optically stunning close-up work.",0
"Good product: I bought this from Amazon after going to multiple pet stores to find a quality, versatile carrier for our son's yorkshire terrier. This actually is very flexible in that it is a backpack, a rollaway, and more importantly for us, a safe car seat for our pet who normally would be all over the interior. It's also the correct size for carry-on with the airlines. The inside is roomy enough for our pet to lie down and has a safety strap to keep him secure. Two nice side pockets add convenience. The only reason i don't give it 5 stars is that I wish it had some extra padding inside for comfort, or at least have an insert which could easily fit. I haven't found anything yet, but this was definitely the best option for us for car traveling and air travel.",1
"Too Fast Paced: I am a psychologist who teaches child psychology, a mother of a toddler, and a big fan of the ""Baby Songs"" videos. Unlike the other Baby Songs videos, however, the ""Rock and Roll"" tape jumps quickly from shot to shot, often focusing in closely on small parts of the pictures. Several of the videos that accompany the songs even focus in on pictures turned sideways and go quickly back and forth from color to black and white. While this appears to be an attempt to mimic adult music videos, this is not the best format for children. My toddler has a difficult time following it, to the point that it simply does not hold his attention. (The other Baby Songs tapes are great at holding his attention throughout.) In addition, this type of programing -- quick jumping -- has been linked to decreased creativity over the long run in children. I recommend another ""Baby Songs"" video over the ""Rock and Roll"" tape.",0
"Not anything to jump at...: I recommend the Mind's Eye dramatization of this. At least Mind's Eye gets the pronunciation of names correct. GahLOOM for Gollum? All it takes is listening to Tolkien himself reading ""Riddles in the Dark"" (I recommend the Tolkien Audio Collection) to know that these producers didn't do their homework. Also, the split narrative is a bit distracting, and Bilbo's constant hemming and hawing makes him sound like he has a mental condition. The voice casting leaves MUCH to be desired as well. Gandalf (or GawnDAWLF as they mispronounce it) sounds awful! This actor would be interesting as Wormtongue in LOTR, but as Gandalf - PTOOIE! The script is not badly written, although they emphasize some WEIRD things in the plot, like an overlong description of Elrond.",0
never received product: never received what I ordered. I was sent the wrong product. Contacted Standing Ovation DVDs and they were to send me correct product and I never received it. I had to purchase it from Best Buy at a higher price will never use Standing Ovation again,0
"Excellent CD-Burner: I have this Burner at work and use it daily. Excellent product, easy installation, and easy to use. I find the speed is more then efficient for back-up, software back-up and of course MUSIC. My employer paid 199.00 plus shipping for his and now I'm going to purchase my at Amazon (cheaper of course).",1

"Hmm....400th review: I'm giving these boys 2 stars...Sing about more mature stuff, grow up, and get new clothes. I'll give you props for trying and because your decent looking.",0
"good time watch: this movie was just fun. there were so many characters in it, each with their own personality that it kept you interested. there was no attempt to hide anything taboo in the movie. i also liked the fact that there was not the typical aids sufferer often seen in these types of movies. there was sex in the movie but i do not feel that sex was its main objective. to me the main idea of the movie was to show that gay men and women are looking for love just like straight people. everyone has love to give and most are just looking for someone to give that love to. the movie portrayed all the same trials and tribulations that straight relationships go through and i think it was intrended. the filmmaker is making the distinction that gay love is not different from straight love, and that is the statement the movie makes. this movie is good for a nice night at home, and will bring a smile to your face.",1
"Fantastic, could not put it down: I saw the IMAX movie made at the same time of this tragedy. I then bought the book and read it in one day. I felt it was an honest attempt to explain what happended. This is one of the best books I've ever read.",1
"If you aren't fluent in Spanish don't buy this movie!: I bought this movie thinking that it had subtitles, but alas, it did not. I was so disappointed, I am having trouble buying any foreign films online, for fear of wasting more money. What is the sense in watching a film if you can't understand what is going on? I wish that it had been clearly labeled.",0
"Birth of and Elephant: Well, ""birth of an elephant"" is what Maiden members say about the rather lenghty writing process of Dave Murray. But is worth waiting for: the man knows how to deliver a blues-based riff in a metal context.This song in particular is the best Murray track since Still Life and an adequate appetizer for the new album.Congratulations to Maiden, for seeding this quite barren 21st Century musical world. God bless you!",1
Great Item given the price: Fair quality leather as it has left a mark right at the buckle point. Otherwise looks good with the Tommy hilfiger logo on a pair of jeans. Is more casual than a formal belt.,1
"It was a great book, It tells about Kwan's life of skating: This book is great for young generation, it tells about the life of young girl who had a dreamed to become a legend in skating-to win in Olympic and World. And also, it tells about How to accept the downward of her skating and managed to get up again. This is an absolute great book for the children to read.",1
"Compellingly Subtle: Snatched this album from Itunes on release date. Even before I listened to it, I noticed the track titles which to be seemed really interesting! I wrote a small blog on it. If you wanna check it out[...], Movies section.Now to the music. I am re listening to it for the third time and even if nothing stands out as a theme, overall it's perfect background for the novel and the story. And that is what a soundtrack should be in the first place. The tone is somber but also mystical and almost sacred. Strings are a perfect choice and Hans Zimmer does a wonderful job overall! Each track has a spirif of its own. 13 tracks appear in the film and each is a step towards enlightment. Enjoy :)",1
"Don't Waste Your Time - BEWARE: I don't care how good these chocolates are, I ordered on April 18 2008. Emailed them finally because they hadn't been shipped. Never got a response to me email. They finally shipped them FedEx Ground on the 28th of April, 10 days later at a charge of $10 for shipping. Now they will certainly be melted by the time they arrive.Look, I also ordered Leonidas Belgian Chocolates and Godiva, because I wanted to try some various kinds. Godiva still hasn't shiped but I highly recommend Leonidas Belgian. I got them in one day and they responded to an email in the same day. They arrived in excellet condition and were so good that I ordered three more.BEWARE and look at seller profile and feedback.",0

"Interesting story: I bought this after reading about the Titanic's last voyage (got into the sinking ship thing, I guess). While this book is quite short, I did enjoy getting the background story of the Lusitania and reading the details of the ship's last voyage. I must say I was horrified to learn that the ship sailed, with willing passengers, into an area where the danger of being destroyed was a constant threat. Overall, this book gave me an interesting, albeit sad, history lesson. I just with the book had been longer.",1

Natural sinus relief: I love these supplements because there are no side effects and they are all natural. They help me breath through my nose instead of mouth at night.,1
"too bad about the typos: The stories are great, of course. They are real stories, with plots. But since when do Library of America editions have typos? They bugged me so much that I sold it to a second-hand bookstore. It appears that Microsoft spell-check was run instead of hiring a proof-reader.",1
"Good, but not excellent: Pros:1. Good battery life2. Handset speaker3. Answering machine access from handset4. Ability to page people within the house5. No interference with wireless network (as opposed to 2.4 GHz phones). Actually, I did not have a problem with a 900 MHz phone, but those are out of fashion these days.Cons:1. The range is actually much worse than that of my old 900 MHz Sony2. Phone book has nothing in common with those of the cell phones, which makes it a bit difficult to get used to navigation techniques3. Paging always causes the destination handset to ring, even when its ringing is switched off4. There is no power backup option for the base, so during the power outage you cannot receive the calls and you lose the time settings.",1
"Missed my train stop.: Loved this book. Kept me in suspense thru the entire thing. I ride the train to work each day and, of course, I have my Kindle. I missed my stop because I was so into this book. Jack Reacher comes to Texas and encounters not only the heat of the Texas summer, but murder. A must read!",1
"Tears more than cuts: I got one of these a few years back, with a set, and it was OK. Eventually I upgraded to another Henckels knife. That eventually wore out and I decided to try one of these again. Mistake.This knife is unsuitable for any bread. Crusty bread it slides off the side unless you are very careful (which you quickly learn to be, if just to save your fingers). Other bread it kind of cuts, kind of tears.Unacceptable.",0
"Fireworks 4 FX Design: This book is a good ""starter"" book.. The one thing that really annoyed me was the abundance of errors in this book. This is my first FX book, bought it with so much anticipation :-(. The bottom line is, if you bought this book and you find yourself asking ""what am I doing wrong?"", here is a news flash for you - ""IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!"". Save yourself the money and buy the quickstart series (a 5 star rating) or the Fireworks 4 Bible (fantastic reference!).",0
"An ""Oldie"" worth reading: MRR is one of my favorite authors and this book, like all of hers, is excellent. There aren't a lot of characters but it's a good idea to keep track of them because otherwise the end of the book becomes very confusing. You won't be disappointed in this book. It's well-written and moves quickly.",1
"Quality Lens: I purchased this lens to go with my Pentax K-5 and have been very pleased with the results thus far. As someone who does outdoor portrait photography, this lens is invaluable. I'm pleased with the speed of focus and image quality. Very good purchase for any Pentax users.",1
Ben Jersey: This jersey was much cheaper quality than what I was expecting. I purchased a Brady Patriots Jersey for my boyfriend and it was much nicer. This one is see through with vinyl lettering. The patriots jersey had cloth lettering and much higher quality.,0
"Great idea - awful follow through: This book was so disappointing. I was excited to read it because I had fallen into the trap of believing it was a good piece of literature from critic's reviews. The story line was also intriguing and I looked forward to reading the tale. Although I did not enjoy it after the first few pages, I continued to read it in anticipation of redeeming qualities that would explain all the hype. Sadly, there were none. The characters were poorly developed and the story focused solely on details while skipping over essential parts of the plot. I do not recommend this book.",0
Great product: I already bought this dvd for myself a couple of years ago and really liked the explainations on how to use proper form for beginners. It was recommended to me by a pilates instructor I had a couple of years ago. I bought this dvd for a friend that was interested in pilates after having her baby and didn't have the money or time to go to a pilates studio. She loves being able to have the time to workout with this dvd and also spend time with her daughter too. I would definitely recommend this dvd to everyone.,1

"Love my boppy: If you've never used a boppy, it is super handy for breastfeeding. You've probably noticed other pillows tend to slide off your lab or are awkward to position. This fits you snugly.

"Ridiculously overrated: A director tosses in some ""artful"" shots and full nudity for most of the movie and suddenly it's a ""beautiful film""???I kept expecting to see Marilyn Chambers pop up in scenes. I'm not against T&A flicks, but this is trying to be something it isn't, which is sad and pathetic. It's a cheap trashy film that gets a good reputation b/c of who directed it.",0
"2 yrs and older love it!! Mom- -not so much: My daycare children LOVE this ""toy"". Overall, they enjoy sitting and listening/reading together for small periods at a time. One BIG problem I have is that the ""batteries are low"" voice comes out alot. Even after I just replaced the batteries (once within 30 min). Either, I am battery impaired or the 4 3AAA batteries are not enough ""juice"" and last only a very very short time.",1
Piece of garbage: Please do not buy this item. I am really surprised to see that there are actually some good reviews for this thing. It is so cheaply made and will not stay open. The little latch that is supposed to hold the umbrella open will not keep it open. Try using it on a shoot and you will be really embarrassed. I won't even attempt to re-sell this on Craigslist because I know whoever buys it will be disappointed. At first I thought maybe I got a bad one but then I had another photographer friend that bought one and she had the exact same problem. Suck it up and buy the Lastolite ezybox instead.,0
"best book ever: This is the best story! i have bought so many copies because i want to have one but i keep lending it out and not getting it back. Starts out a little heavy but an uplifting book with excellent writing. You laugh, cry and it is just enchanting!",1
"Disappointed: I was very excited to order these for my new home, however when I recieved them, I was disappointed in the print on the coasters. The colors dont come through much and it looks more like a dark smear of color. You really have to study it to see the dragonfly and the colors are very bland...nothing like the vivid colors/contrast represented in the pictures here.On a more positive note, the size is very nice and the materials used for absorption are very effective. If you want highly functional products, this is for you. However, if you want something pretty, choose a different set.",0

"Greatest CD Ever: Kim Wilde is an extroidanary artist and this cd shows it I recently heard the song ""Keep Me Hangin On"" and I did not know who sang it and when i found out I hadto have the album i was born in 1988 so i dont remember much 80's music but what i have learned is Kim Wilde rocks. Buy this album and you'll be hooked I listen toit every day songs like ""Never Trust A Stranger"" and ""Water On Glass"" So Buy this Album you will love it"".",1
"disappointing images: I think the producer meant well but the movie was disappointing because the sharpness and contrast of the images was so excessive that it was difficult to make them out. Manet uses a lot of very vivid colors including black in his painting and some of the images especially Olympia comes out so dark it is almost all black. Too bad, I so looked forward to this movie. The information was fairly ok though. I will look at it again anyway. For good Manet images go to Rosamund Bernier Impressionists series on four videos, especially the one entitled Modern Art and Modern Manners. These videos are all available used or new on Amazon or Barnes and Noble. I hope someday someone will make a really well done retrospective on DVD of Manet's work",0
"Nightmare: I'm a native Russian speaker and a lang.teacher. What really amuses me is how many useless expensive courses are out there..Russian is one of the most difficult languages in the world with a complicated grammar that means you should take some private lessons/ group beginners course with a teacher, preferably native speaker.Ok, so you know now how to ask about the bus station direction. Will you understand the answer?",0
"Don't waste your time on old technology at this price: First of all, the image shown is incorrect -- the Braun 7526 does not have an LCD display. Only the 7680 model does in the 7000 series.Second, this model is now several generations behind the latest Braun shavers. There were some drawbacks/imperfections that have been addressed in the later models.Third, the price listed for this model is actually higher than what you'd typically pay to get one of the later models.Fourth, this was the first model to introduce the cleaning station, and so it has a couple of design flaws. The most notable issue is that there is a lock down tab inside the unit that easily breaks after a year or two of use, making it impossible for the cleaning station arm to lock the shaver into place. Braun abandoned this design in the next version, smartly eliminating the arm and putting charging ports on the back side of the shaver unit.Don't waste your money... buy the later 8000 series shaver by Braun. You'll be glad you did.",0
"Visually pleasing: I have to say I loved this book! I loved it so much that I went online & ordered the first two in the series. Nancy Martin can visually float you through the book, page after page...and the couture is pure pleasure!",1
Outstanding content that is understandable w/ real examples: I was very impressed with the content of the book and the way the author presents material in an understandable and approachable way. After reading the book I have already started to use the strategy of buying leap options on companies before the split date of the stock. I recently purchased options on Rambus and made over 400% return on a minimal investment. I was able to personally meet Mr. Larson recently at a local seminar and was very impressed with his attitude and enthusiasm for helping traders manage their own portfolios and outperform the market. I would highly recommend this book to traders of all experience levels.,1
"Worst Case Ever!!!: Ordered for work and school use, this is the worst rolling case I have every owned. The ""new spell"" is horrible, makes you wonder if that alone is a health hazard. The case is big and bulky with my laptop, appointment pad for work, as well as 4 class books (2 are approx. 1/2-in thick; 2 are approx. 1-in thick)and a notebook. I had used the case for less than 2 weeks when the wheels began to look as if they were 6 months old. The wheels are not ""smooth rolling"" as the description indicated. Instead, you get a rough feel and the wheels began to peel around the center and the outside. I also began to notice that the bag was coming apart at the seams, even though the case itself was not overstuffed.I would send this awful case back. However, due to my schedule being so full I haven't had the time to pack and ship the darn thing; and have missed the November 3rd. I lost $30 in shipping fees and $70 + dollars for the cost of the bag. Great for Amazon.... really sucks for me!!!",0
Ok Camcorder/Camera: I got this camera for christmas and i use it on occasion. It takes descent videos on the highest quality but you cant move it too quickly. The photos are horrible. You have to hole it completely still and it still comes out blurry. You also cant put extera lenses on it. Overall its okay but i definately would suggest a camcorder with a hard drive or mini dv or just any one with a rechargeable battery.,1
Thank you for the order: 7 y/o son loves it! Received as promised in great condition. Thank you very much!,1
"Not for every day use! ""Tray"" is a big waste!: I have been using this booster seat for a while now and it is nothing but a pain to me. the tray that came with it went in the closet the first day we bought the booster seat and we have never used it. (My slender son would not fit in the seat with the tray attached.) For a while, the seat worked well. I guess it still ""works"" well, but it is the most pain in the rear thing to clean. There are way too many cracks and crevases to possibly keep it clean. And the retractable belts are a great idea, but in my opinion are just a breeding ground for bacteria and other things from the impossibility to keep it clean.If you were to use this as an occasional on-the-go seat, I would probably recommend it, but don't buy this seat if you plan on using it daily as your primary booster seat!",0
"What a bad toaster: Bought one, didn't work, sent it back. Got the second one, and it toasted half the bread on one side, and not the bread closest to the end of the toaster. Really poorly made!! They offered me a buy back. I replaced it with the cuisinart toaster which works very well. What a disappointment. I have several kitchenaid appliances, including my stove.",0
"The Worst Toaster Oven EVER!!!!!!!!!!: This oven burns everything it cooks!!! The top gets way hotter than the bottom and it comes on when it is supposed to only be baking. If you buy this oven you're really you'll be sorry, and your friends will laugh at all the burnt food cook. Amazon why can't I rate this item a ZERO STARS??????",0
"Not logical, Captain.: I've read it more than once, to get his message and I agree that one can cleverly resolve vexing issues by simply being/stepping into the present. However, that is just a defensive tool to avoid depression and to turn on ""happy apathy"" when the going gets tough. Neat trick, but the ""fluffy bunny"" experience does not, in my opinion, guide one to spiritual enlightenment. It just guides one on how to selfishly step out of the icky game of life and irresponsibly leave the remaining writhing mass of humanity to their own discomforts. Slaves of sleep. Not logical Captain. Spiritual enlightenment would seem to be the creative taking of full responsibility for repairing the games of life so one never gets trapped again. Less tragic lessons. More wisdom in resolving life's little anxieties rather than ignoring them. Read Judge Thomas Troward for empowering creative enlightment.",0
broken grinder 3 weeks after purchase: if you intend on using a osborn log brush buy two grinders if you are going to brush whole house.

"Great for Infants, not bigger than 3-4 Months: This is ideal for very small babies, not bigger babies (3-4 months plus) becauise it gets a bit uncomfortable for them. There is a bump in the middle that is the problem, but its also a sign that you need to change th position of your baby in THIS tub and start thinking about washing in the regular tub.",1

"Hot Tamara doesn't sizzle: I was very excited about this book because it is rare to find a good latina romance that isn't just fluff and stereotypes. Saying that, this book was disappointing. The sentence structure was jumbled most of the time, and hard to understand. The characters were very underdeveloped to the point of being two-dementional. The real point of the story seemed to be the mother-daughter relationship, and the mother's character was too painfully exaggerated to be realistic. It was very hard to be swept away by this book. I love romances where a woman finds herself, but Tamara's anxious efforts to become more ""independent"" weren't endearing, they were just plain annoying. Don't waste your money.",0
Came a Spider: The novel Came A Spider by Edward Levy was a very good book. It was full of suspense . It was almost like a horror movie. I think this book was very well written there was a lot of detail.The first chapter kept you interested. In the first chapter there is already a mystery to be solved and in order to figure it out you have to keep reading. The plot was very strong it was built at a good pace.One of the things that I really liked about the book was the characters. The characters were very realistic. It was very easy to relate to them because you got to look into their personal lives.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and mystery. Came A Spider is a very well written book that I'm sure you will enjoy.,1

"Heartfelt Novel: I have read many of Kingsbury's novels and this one has to be my favorite! Kingsbury writes about these characters as if she were talking about people she actually knows. She has an incredible talent for bringing the characters alive. I truly felt like I knew this family and their trials and tribulations, personally. I finished this book in three days having had a hard time putting it down. I reccomend this book for anyone that has ever been in a family, knows a family or is married with a family. Great reading, please send your fans more, soon!",1
"Buyer Beware: I have PCOS and have been TTC for almost 4 years now. I have been to a fertility doctor and stopped going right before starting shots. My body did not respond to clomid. I have very irregular periods about 1 a year on my own. I have lost about 70 pounds and read all the rave reviews on this product so I decided to give it a go. The first month nothing, the second nothing, the third month nothing. The website said allow 3 months so I went and had a blood pregnancy test done just to be sure I wasn't and decided to give it 1 more month so 4 months and nothing happened. Please women do not get your hopes up on this one like I did. You nay be sadly lead into believing it will definitely work for you because you are irregular.",0
"do not buy this: I purchased two of these products, one for myself and one for a friend, after reading reviews. I had a bad flea infestation in my small house and all this trap caught was a spider. My friend had the same experience. Washing my dogs everyday gets rid of fleas more effectively and is more cost efficient.",0
"At times uneven but often fascinating.: I love Ms Atwood's writing period. I mean,in my opinion she could write about the phone book and keep me engrossed. You may not agree with me,I know,I just wanted to state that before I review this book,which while not her best work of the ones I've read so far, still resonates. The three woman are so well-drawn that you feel like you are snooping in on some very good friends. All quite flawed, but still the kind of friends I wish I had more of. Also, There are,unfortunately,""Zenias"" in this world,although most don't operate on such a high-level of manipulation as she does. The stark reality of these woman's lives is a vivid,though at times,a bit unbelievable parallel to this woman who seems to exist only for her own selfish needs. It's a scary,sometimes funny and often sad book that will keep you wondering what will happen next.",1
"Ear Candy: Signals marks the beginning of their synth/guitar lush sound that would stretch 4 albums from 1982 to 87ish; Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire. This period is one of the best periods from Rush for those of us who love synthesizers! Before signals Geddy used synths sparingly. After Hold Your FIre synths starts to dissapear from Rush albums, this is ok too after all Rush is a rock trio and synths or no synths the band rocks, but Signals has a synergy that at the time was fresh, and holds up well today, in fact sonicly Signals is far better than many modern rock albums from bands who sell millions of records toting lame songs and second rate guitar chords stolen from bands who played them originally 20 years ago. Signals is very original and sounds like no other Rush album. Analog Kid may well be one Rush's finest moments.",1
"8 years of experience with this book: I have had wonderful experience with this book. I first read the book about 8 years ago about 6 months after my first child was born. The change in his sleep was dramatic. My children are now 8 and 5.5. They have good sleep habits. We read a few books together, they get into their beds, they look at a few books on their own, and then the lights go out. They go to sleep on their own (They have since they were babies). They sleep in their own beds the entire night (My son from 7 months, my daughter from 3 months). My next child (due in September)will be raised as a Baby Wise baby.I do agree that you can take what you want from the book. There is flexibiltity in the schedule. This is just a guideline.Good luck feeding and sleeping on a demand schedule.",1
"Not what it's cracked up to be.: This book had a lot of the same material as the first book he wrote. I'm sure his weight loss plan does work, but what average person would be able to stick to this? And the part about giving yourself a shot each day, most people aren't willing to do that. This book would be great for someone who has ample time to eat right and do everything recommended, but for the average person that's on the go all the time it's very unreasonable.",0

"Interesting Reading: ""The Banned Book of Mary, How her story was suppressed by the church and hidden in art for centuries"" was interesting but it seemed curious to me that it focuses on the banning of the book by the church. Most of the Catholics that I know are already familiar with the story and if the knowledge of the book was banned why did the chuch tolerate so much art about it? Why didn't the church have the art destroyed and condemned as heretical?Hock's book was interesting in that I was not overly familiar with this story of Mary. I did hear it alluded to in a Christmas pagent but didn't know it's sources. It information was interesting but I can see why it was not added to the cannon of scripture. On the other hand I do not think it should be banned either, but is interesting legend and reading.This book is good for anyone who is interested early church history and early manuscripts by early Christians. -- Valerie Lull, Author, Ten Healthy Teas",1

"DO NOT RENT.: Do not rent this book! It will not include page numbers or images, and therefore is virtually worthless. The text is wonderful, but it is of no help to me as a student trying to write an art history paper if I can't create citations or imagery (which is not referenced in the text itself so I can't simply google the images). So much for trying to save money by renting it; maybe if you buy it everything will be there but I don't have $30 to splurge, especially since I just wasted $11.",0
boring: I bought this CD and I was not satisfied what so ever. I would not play this CD around anyone. I think Autechre needs to work on their skills. Viedo games have better music than this.,0
"weird and wonderful: I looked this rarity out after having read his amazing biography of Vivienne Westwood & I was not disappointed. This guy has a totally unique takes (or set of takes) on biography writing, a combination of tongue in cheek verite and cruelly refreshing insight. But this book will altogether make all Bushists uneasy and I see on the Net it has veru much enraged them and I bet it really riled Kate Bush herself, too. All the more reason to relish it, maybe? A real treat, a music biography that treats the reader like a co-conspiritor rather than a sad ""fan"" and loser and lapper up of trivia. Also it is very funny - in more senses than one!!!",1
"How to create anything you desire: The Path of Least Resistance presents us with as close to an ""owner's manual"" for being human of anything I have read. It systematically teaches you how to use your brain and central nervous system to create the results which most truly matter to you. I (Al) have used the principles explained by Fritz for the past fifteen years or so with considerable success. The process is so incredibly simple, you may be tempted to dismiss it. But just try it and you can change your life dramatically.",1
"Deft Grace: Lightness and grace permeate the words in this book. Throughout, the reader can sense a warm heart and compassionate eye. A joy to read for observations on family, on history, on nostalgia, on desire...the poems create a beautiful presence and experience for the attentive reader. I thank the poet for her words.",1

Highly recommend this to anyone with a great appreciation for instrumental music.",1
"Yawwn....: What can I saw about this bad album that hasnt already been said?Not much. The first half of the album sounds like they actually have some direction. 'Juicebox', 'Razorblade', 'On The Other Side' are fun tracks, but oh my, so many of these songs are boring! I swear I had to change from song to song every 2 minutes because it was causing the food in my stomach to turn.Julian's lazy singing is so irritating. I loved it on the first two albums because of the way it effortlessly passed through the fuzzbox while the guys in the back coordinated their riffs, but it seems on this one that he's completely oblivious to what the rest of the band is doing.They aren't Television. If you're sick of hearing that comparison, fine. Screw it. Go get their albums (Marquee Moon and Adventure) and see for yourself. Television is leaps above The Strokes. I bought a ticket to see The Strokes live in Dublin and now I feel cheated. I think I'll return it if that's possible.",0

"HORRIBLE Quality! Doesn't last & is upsetting when it won't work!: Horrible quality, great concept. My daughter loved the idea of this journal when she got it. It worked for about two weeks before malfuncting. i patiently read the directions for troubleshooting tips to no avail. it never worked again--my daughter was crushed when we had to return it. we opted not to try again with another one due to the numerous negative reviews for similar problems. examples of problems: stops recognizing your voice and won't open. starts to repeat commands when you've already followed its directions etc... (annoying and what a shame)",0
"This was a good purchase... not a good product: With this item my GF finally gave me head, and she actually salivated more like I intended. This lube did the job flawlessly with the exception that it burned her vaginally. She has sensitive skin so the only use now is oral. The tastes are off at first, but as it mixes with your saliva it becomes better. It should be a three star in my case, but I know that if my GF wasn't sensitive it would be 4. Not disappointed with my purchase, but I still remain undecided as to whether or not to buy this product again. Will explore other natural lubes before buying again.",1
"UNBELIEVABLE!: I bought this CD at one of Michael's Concerts and I got to say I was NOT disappointed at all. Strong lyrical and guitar content. ""Wasted"" is song I would expect Dylan to write.

"Sound and Picture Sync Issue: I bought this tv a few months ago and it seemed the picture and sound were not in sync. My husband thought I was making this up...obviously NOT! TV is still under warranty, so I'll call Westinghouse and see if they'll take care of the problem. My suggestion is to buy a different tv, it's very annoying watching this and not really all that cheap.",0

"Enjoyable insight into thinking and methods of hacker type.: The book provides an idea of the reasons for the thinking ofthe people that do this sort of hacking. After reading it,I can't help but wonder how far some of these people couldhave gone in the ""real"" world if they had put as much workinto legitimate activities. It also proves the point thatthere is not as much genius involved as headlines would haveus believe, but instead there is a lot of hard work andpossiby some luck involved.I would be interested in reading a book, five years from now,telling what has happened to many of the characters.",1
"Fantastic album!: I have been listening to this wonderful album ever since I purchased it three weeks ago. The only song I don't really care much for is ""Cooties"", but other than that the songs and music are as infectious as the movie is, and overall, are delightful. I think all the actors did a great job with their vocals, (James Marsden REALLY surprised me with his great vocals) but I especially love Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, and Elijah Kelley. Each of them knocked their songs out of the park! If any one of these three release albums, I will definitely purchase them.My favorite songs on the album are:""Good Morning Baltimore""""Nicest Kids in Town""""I Can Hear the Bells""""Ladies' Choice""""Welcome to the Sixties""""Run and Tell That""""Without Love""""You Can't Stop the Beat""""Come So Far (Got So Far To Go)""",1

"Grand Opera Collection: This EMI Seraphim collection of the Orchestral Works from ""Grand"" Operas is quite good, if not essential. While I'm not an opera fan per say, I do very much enjoy the orchestral excerpts from most operas. This set in particular shines for three reasons in my opinion. First and foremost, boasting excellent performances at a budget-price, this is a great disc for the casual fan. Second, for the more astute listener it features brilliant recordings by Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, Antonio de Almeida and Alain Lombard, three highly underrated conductors. Lastly, while half of the operatic works featured here are quite popular (""Carmen,"" ""Samson et Dalila,"" and ""Faust""), others are lesser known (those by Massenet, Gounod, Delibes and Thomas) yet equally enjoyable. In all, this is another Seraphim title that will appeal to the novice and serious collector alike.",1
"Met expectations: Arrived promptly, although not packaged very well inside the product box (the shipping box was fine). Made me wonder if I was getting a previously used item.

"lifesaver: This book saved me! My first calc class blew me away i credit the teacher but no need for excuses. I did very poor on my first college calc exam then I dropped the class and read this book very intently until I got a good understanding of the calculus ideas. The author, Mark Ryan is brilliant, his credibility precedes him which is obvious. He is very easy to understand and cracks a lot of jokes though out the book. Two things to point out: I don't suggest skipping class and just reading this book it will not work because, use this as an aid if anything, also the book takes a while to go through and really understand all the steps in the example. Anyway great book, helped me get an A in calc I and II and hopefully III.",1

"Libs Don't Sound Convincing Enough To Brainwash Anyone: Let me say that I too haven't read this book. Also, this doesn't make me as condemnable as what liberals have charged the one star reviewers for doing, and that is passing judgment with no basis. Instead, I too, like the reviewer pandorasdad, am going to depreciate the people on both sides of the aisle, as libs and cons are both over-the-top in their hardened party lines.However, i'm not gonna' be clement to rate this with 3 stars. I give this one star based on the stinging fact that's materialized, which is that the liberals are REALLY, just monstrously more hostile and corrosive in their reviews. Just looking at the last few liberal reviews, It's obvious that they refuse to retain any trace of civility and composure; instead willfully choosing to angrily lash out at anyone who doesn't subserve their liberal plan.",0
"I can't believe this is their debut album!: Diverse songs. Thoughtful, expressive lyrics with tight grooves and guitar rifs that punctuate and weave throughout.

However, It is based on its own treatment program, and during the narration of its program, the information tend to repeats itself and becomes tedious. In all, I think it is informative.",1
"Good Light-hearted Comedy: It was just a good solid comedy. Nothing epic, but fun and cute. I didn't expect to be entertained but completely was!",1
"Forget it by the pool: I won't go into all the plot holes and weaknesses of this book, they have already been mentioned by A. Lewis in his review.I think of 'The Historian' as a book you want to like, because the narrative is flowing and the writing is decent, but you can't like it, because you feel that it's just missing something.Besides, I had the uneasy feeling that the author's historical knowledge is presented as if it were taken straight out of Wikipedia.",0
"Didn't like: I purchased the Diaper Champ for the same reason that most people do... no need to use special garbage bags. However, I was extremely disappointed in how difficult it is to get the top open to change the bags. I break a fingernail every time I have to do it!! Also, my daughter is only 3 months old and her diapers aren't even bad yet; unfortunately, after just a day of changing diapers (and making sure the diaper tags are secure), the darn thing is already difficult to flip. I'm sure it is great about keeping the odor down, but I have to change the bag every 2 days anyway because it is clogged up. I do not recommend it at all.",0
"Really bad trimmer, a lot of parts: It just didn't trim as well as did my old Norelco. Replacing the parts is a chore, too. The 1 inch and 2 inch trimmer covers are the exact same size and there is no place for the 3rd in the stacker. The shaver was good, but the trimmer was doing nothing. Thanks but I'm going back to Norleco.",0
This book stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This book contains very little information of value for the golfer looking for great golf. There are much better books with more useful information.,0
flows very smoothly in my stereo: This is one of my all time favorite albums. I got it last summer at a tmt show and can't stop listening to it. The guys are really musically talented and Flow shows off all their skill. Some songs are very danceable and others are very mellow- like Blue and Sudden or San Francisco are extremely mellow and beautiful.It is hard to classify this album as just pop rock or folk rock or jam music. The songs are each really well done- and are a mix of bluegrass/rock/pop/jam band I suppose.I would recommend this album or seeing them live if you live near where they play.,1
"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's: If you are a fan of The Mitford Series, I think you will also enjoy A Miracle For St. Cecilia's. Set in a quaint, charming, New England town, you will meet an endearing set of characters, both parishoners at St. Cecilia's, as well as the towns folk of Dorsetville. Leading the parishoners of St. Cecilia's is Father James, who learns that St. Cecilia's doors will be closed due to lack of funds. Heart-broken, Father James is distressed at what will happen to his St. Cecilia's family, who rely on the church and their friendships there, to get through life's struggles.Katherine Valentine is a gifted writer, though her style is simple, it is wonderfully easy to read, and creates a true warmth and feeling of comfort. Even though it did seem a lot like the Mitford series, it was still creative in the story lines, entertaining and insightful. For those with Christian roots, it provides some strong messages of faith & hope.",1
"A disgrace to all true Puppy People.: I only truly like one song on this horrible Cd, and thats Chris Vrenna's Assimilate, which is probably as good as the original. All the other songs are horrible, even Ogre's remake of Smothered Hope! Censor is turned into a song that is almost a rap song, I almost cried it was so bad. And the Deftones ruin one of the greatest Puppy songs. Do not buy this if you are one of the Puppy People.",0
"Perfect Read: This book was absolutely wonderful..it grabs your attention immediately, i would read it again if I did'nt have so many other books to choose from",1
"Give In and Send Money: The premise of this book seems to be: Your child is a legal adult, so don't tell him/her what to do, just send money. Yes, that's right, I felt that the book seemed to advise doing exactly as the son or daughter would prefer. I had hoped for a guide to ensuring that certain standards are met, in order to justify the flow of money. You know, like decent grades, reasonable plans for finishing on time, no wasting money on luxury purchases while Mom and Dad are sacrificing to pay tuition, etc. Instead, what I found was a guide to feeling OK about giving up those expectations. Not so useful.",0
"Amazing!: One of the best scores I have ever heard. The use of timpani drums and castanets is brilliant, and accentuates the movie perfectly. It is also one of the few scores that can be appreciated entirely its own. Kraemer's original song ""How To Make A Margarita"" is humorous.I have recommended this score to many friends who usually do not listen to ""classical"" music, with great effect. I can't wait to see what Kraemer comes up with next!",1
I'm from Iowa: This DVD is the TV version in that every 45 minutes you have a recap of the previous 45 minutes; they just cut out the TV ads.Would have been better if it was the movie version like they had on the sci-fi channel.5 people watched this tape and all 5 were really interested and pleased with it.,1
Wouk just did not click with me: I just could not get into this book. Perhaps I did not give it enough of a chance (about 15%)but it just was not working.,0
"The Napster Chronicles: Unless you are a fan of Load to begin with, I don't think anyone in their right mind would think leftover tracks from that recording would be a good idea for an entire new album. Isn't the ""Memory Remains"" one of the stupidest things you have ever heard...c'mon...admit it. I can understand people maybe liking Load for what it is, something different, but how hackneyed is calling leftover tracks, ""RELOAD"". I guess after Load Bob Rock wasn't able to pinch anything else from them so he said, ""All right guys lets just re-tool the crap from the last one."" I'm sure they didn't put up a fight, they're rich now.",0
Good house remix single: The tracklist for this cd is1. The sound of breaking up2. The sound of breaking up [Paulmac's after dark remix]3. The sound of breaking up [l'more remix]4. Just the thing [Sgt Slick's vinyl voyage club mix]This cd is more upbeat than the stay single with all house versions with the remixes. Remixes not as good as other singles but still a class above your standard remix singles. Very worthwhile.,1
"Same as ever...: Have been wearing Reebok Classics for twenty years or more and ordered this pair when they were no longer available locally. They arrived two days later, and I was pleased to find the same reliable fit and comfort that has kept me buying Reeboks over the years. My initial reluctance to order a size-sensitive product online was overcome by Reebok's tendency to remain consistent in quality and fit, and I was not disappointed. Would I order again? You bet!",1
"skip this one if you're looking for the blues: To be fair, I've only listened to this album once, and sometimes albums take a while to grow on me. But this collection makes it seem that French women cannot sing the blues! The strongest tracks here come from (American) Abbey Lincoln and Nina Simone; the others are the sort of wispy, breathy fluff that I imagine French parents listened to in the 1960s the way mine listened to Mantovani and Doris Day. You might like this style or not, but it's not the blues, so pass this one up if that's what you're looking for.",0

Not up to expectations: The cheese head doesn't fit very comfortably on most peoples head because the hole is shallow. The foam can also easily tear if you're not careful. My son really wanted it for Christmas so I bought it but if I had seen it in person first I probably wouldn't have bought it.,0
"Why cut it ? Why ?: People listen to me save your hard earned money and buy the first VHS tape of this, not the Euro one but the first one include 50 more min of the movie not shown on this DVD. I waited a long time for this to come out on DVD ,then you only see half of it .",0
"Fantastically Awful: Now I'm sure that my tastes aren't the same as everyone's, however, I am a fan of 'so bad it's good' type films. And this is one of the best. As stated in the other review of this film I just read, there are plastic eyes aplenty, overly red blood and a cover that does not even tally with the film itself. Fantastically awful, I loved it!",1
"Dancing for Kids DVD: My granddaughter is very interested in dancing/princesses and she associates ballerinas with this. She is a little young for formal dance lessons, but she really is enjoying this DVD. Also, it is great in showing her the correct poses with their proper names. Working out just great.",1
"Magical!!: Toba Garrett's Creative Cookies book fills a niche in the Cookbook market. There are no other books out there that are as clear, inspirational and as easy to follow.

"Meredith Wilson is turning over in his grave!: Chenoweth has a huge voice and she does her part, and reviving ""My White Knight"" from the stage play was a nice addition, but Matthew Broderick as Professor Harold Hill is the worst piece of casting in the history of cinema. The producer and director should go to Meredith Wilson's grave and aplogize. Simply an awful movie.",0

The running watch to own: This is my second Garmin 305 watch. I wore out my first watch after 3 years and 3000+ miles. This watch has everything a runner needs. If you are looking for a watch for a triathlon then look at the newer Garmins due to the water resistance. The price can't be beat. I also purchased the newer heart rate monitor strap versus using the one that comes with the 305 which is worth the money since it is much more comfortable. The quad split screen is easy to see and use. Some people think the watch is bulky. Yes it is not the most fashionable watch but then you are not going to wear it out on the town. I like hooking the watch up and seeing my runs on Google Earth. If you are a high milage runner like me expect the watch to last 3 years. This seems to be the consensus life time among all the feedback I get from others within my running group.,1
I think Clint WIllis is a biased nutball.: Clint must NEVER want to pursue or profess the truth. His book is full of misrepresented stories. His lies are easy to spot and confirm as such. He must be a FAR LEFT WACKO! His book sucked really really bad.....,0
"Not as pictured, but ...: I ordered this but received CD-2 Company Part No. 4111R. The bottle is the same, but the labeling is different; for example, it does not say ""CD-2 Maxx"", but only ""Oil Detergent"". I'm not sure whether the product illustrated is a later or earlier version. I added the product to a car already using full synthetic Mobil 1 Ext. Perf., and was able to tell the engine performance improved right away; it ran ""tighter"" and the connection between the gas pedal movement and the delivered engine power was more solid than before. Whether it cleans up sludge or engine internals is too early to tell.OK, I've now used this product for over a year in various cars. In each case, engine response was noticeably improved, even when added to engines with freshly changed oil (even expensive synthetics). MPGs improved around 10 to 20%. So I have added another star.",1
"What is the big deal about this band????: This is one band that I guess I am totally missing the boat on. Yea, they have a lot of Mellotron, but so what? So do a lot of other mediocre prog bands. I keep hearing these guys being compared to Camel, and I just have to say, ""come on, give me a break""! Sebastian Hardie don't even hold a candle to Camel composition wise. While they do have an occasional pretty melody and some nice instrumental passages, as well as some nice guitar work, most of this stuff I find to be boring, and about as clich√©d as progressive rock could possibly get. All-in-all they are just ho-hum nice and totally, totally overrated.",0
"centennial: Centennial The Complete Series a fair movie, however it is NOT complete. I own a copy of this movie on vhs and ALOT of minutes are missing. The dvd Centennial isn't as good as the original vhs version. That's why I only gave it rating of 2. Redo the DVD version series and put all the minutes back in like the vhs version and it will be a five rating to me.",0
"Excellent Laptop: Sony one of the best. Some of the reviews said the fan is noise and the keyboard is not good. I don't find these problems. Mine is quite and I like the feel of the keyboard. It's very fast. I would like better battery life, and the charger is big. Cost is high but you get what you pay for. all inall I am very happy with my purchase.",1

"Amazing pot... Underrated Company!: This is easily the most used pot in my arsenal. I use it for everything from soups to oatmeal to oven braising. It has fantastic heat distribution and is very durable. I have mine for nearly 7 years and the coating is still fully intact. highly recommend this product especially at this price. Short of copper cookware, it doesn't get much better than this.",1
"Great for pregnant women!: It's slow indeed but it's yoga combined with Pilate moves. It has all the basics in it: pelvic tilt, legs and arms stretching, strengthening exercises for the lower back, hips and abdominal muscles. If you like aerobic workout, very active and dynamic this might not be your stile indeed. It's based more on concentration and controlled movements. I'd say give it a try, especially if you are preparing for a pregnancy or are already pregnant (low risk). Enjoy!",1

"Not bad, but that's less than i expected from Sascha & Co.: I'm not gonna say that this album is bad, because it really isn't. But it certainly isn't great. It's hardly average. It's standard output from a dead industrial band. I loved the majority of KMFDM's output over it's 15 years, with the exception of the bland Nihil and the thrash-obsessed Angst. There are a few standout songs on here, like Witch Hunt, Stare at the Sun and probably Torpedoes, but the rest is pretty much filler, sub-standard for Sascha and company. I expected more, especially after last year's fantabulous Adios. No more to be said.",0

"To all TJ/YJ owners: Even though the newest edition says it has been updated to include up to the 1999 model, information on the YJ/TJ Wranglers is slim at best.

In Citizen soldiers, Ambrose tells the entire story of the European theater through interviews with the veterans while still interjecting the bigger picture. Ambrose also has interviews with German veterans, something few other American historians tend to do. Ambrose shows that the men who fought in WWII were regular people who did extraordinary things.",1

"wasted talent: That is the sad thing, because he is a talented writer, but this novel says nothing. Some of the quotes on the back of the book truly amaze me. To say that this is an ""important book"" or to compare him to truly great writers like Fitzgerald is simply ludicrous. He has not earned that comparison yet. He has potential, but he needs to really work hard and write something worth reading, not this sad, empty, self-pitying, and egoistic [stuff]. Hey, Bret, here's an idea....write a story.",0
"A great way to get up to speed with network programming using Python: The book is written in an engaging, conversational style and is filled with useful nuggets of information about a wide variety of network protocols and the Python modules that speak them. It starts from networking basics and then works up through all the core internet protocols and then some. For any given protocol, more than one Python module that deals with it is often covered, allowing the reader to decide what works best for them.Recommended for any Python developer that would like to increase their knowledge of how to write networked software.",1

"Wow!!: After reading all the good reviews for this stuff I decided to try it. There is no actual science to substantiate the claims made here, so I was more skeptical than usual. However, there was/is no reason for all the people who praise this stuff online and in person to do so and that made me really curious. I have been using this stuff for nearly 2 Weeks, and the only thing about me that hasn't improved is my tax bracket. Get some, try it. Be like the old Nike ad and ""just do it"". If it does nothing for you umm perhaps you're uhhh cursed? No science to substantiate that either, but check your palms and scalp for three 6's. If you find them take a Bible and two Qur'ans and call a rabbi in the morning.",1
"I don't see it lasting...: I don't see this lasting but one season. I wouldn't be surprised if ABC canceled it. It doesn't have the longevity that a lot of other TV shows have and the story line is going to get old and boring over time. The first episode wasn't even promising, it was mediocre, maybe because it's on ABC. And I understand it is the first episode, but the first episode is supposed to grab you and make you want to watch the next episode. I was expecting a more spooky and chilling vibe and I was not satisfied. But again it's ABC and they usually run family oriented shows, even if the shows have a little sex in them. I think if it were on another network and were rewritten to match the novel it would be a good mini-series, maybe AMC should have grabbed it. It is safe to say that I will not carry on with the series.",0

"The House on Mango Street: The House on Mango Street is a difficult book to follow for those who like a plot that is easy to find. I happen to be one of those people, and therefore did not think very highly of Cisneros novel. This book is merely a description of characters of those that live on Mango Street, and the happenings that occur there. Also this novel is written to the way of speaking on Mango Street, in improper English. There are quite a bit of different themes throughout the book. It seems the author was expressing a new theme with about every two chapters or so. Through the descriptions of Mango Street and its people, you notice the main character growing and becoming older. However this book does show character development, I do not recommend it, nor do I prefer it.",0
good bookby Horsegal: This book was OK.Not the best book but still good.The horses sound so great.I wish I could go in the book and ride them!!!!!it's nice parker and Christina got back together.They're a cute couple.I wish Melanie and Kevin would get back together.And I wish Melanie had more books.Oh well .The TB series are great books.Only a few are not that good.But still this book is totally worth your money.

"Excellent treble, acceptable bass: Good value for the money. I use them for the projection demos, hooked up to my 17"" Powerbook. Trebles are outstanding, and basses are more than acceptable, especially if you consider how small those speakers are! However, I have to mention that they are not light at all. In fact, they weight as much as a portable DLP projector. They are very easy to pack (small), but not so easy to transport (heavy).",1
"Satisfy your craving for authentic Italian interiors: This book was my selfish gift to me. I used it as design inspiration for authentic Italian interiors. I still refer to it for ideas. The photos of country villas, rural retreats and urban apartments, took my inspiration in several directions. Keep that in mind because it's not all rustic villas. I especially enjoyed the wall plaster colors and textures as well as the variety in flooring tiles. How simply some of the rooms are furnished! The cover photo is so gorgeous in composition, color, structure....it doesn't get any better.",1
"Lovely light fragrance at a great price: I have purchased this before, and though I don't spray much on each time, it lasts a very long time. The scent is distinctive, but not heavy.",1
Better than a diaper pail: I use these in the diaper bag and in the house. They work better than a diaper pail because the smell is contained and you don't build up an entire diaper pail of smelly diapers. The cost per use is also very close to the Diaper Genie.,1
"Story that starts off with promise/ends confused.: I have read the last 2 books written by Niven: the Ringworld Throne and Destiny's Road. Both were very difficult to follow in that the stories did not flow. It was quite apparent that the Destiny's Road story simply never came to crystal clear fruition for Niven who states in his dedication ""I turned in a draft of Destiny's Road in August 1996, four years overdue. I knew it was an ambitious project, and I flinched from it.""I do not believe Niven ever recovered from that flinch, as the story line becomes very disjointed and hard to follow or picture in one's imagination. I was very sad about this, as the Integral Trees, Smoke Ring, Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers were masterful works, creating great anticipation for more originals from this author. I hope there are a few more imaginative stories yet to be created by him.",0
"Clipperton: Great video about one of the last natural ecosystems of the world....and an amazing history for such a small atoll of coral on our side of the Pacific, 3 days at sea from Acapulco.",1
A vastly different sort of Seuss: This short book exists at two levels. At one level it is about well adjusted people who like to have fun (the King) and malcontents who can't stand to see anyone have fun (Lord Droon). Page Boy Eric is about the age of the audience for this vision of TKS and is instrumental in rescuing the good from the evil.But there is an adult perspective also. The tale is an allegory. I'm not going to tell you what it is - but I will tell you that the key to understanding is the copyright date.,1
"So bad it is hysterically funny! Could become a cult classic....: We originally saw part of this on the local Sci-Fi tv channel earlier this year, and acknowledging that some sci fi is just outright cheesy we set our expectations accordingly. Still, we were stunned. This was SO very bad we ended up laughing hysterically through most of it. Then we gave 2 copies away as Christmas stocking stuffer gag gifts! Let's see, there was the scene where there was a California license plate on the vehicle supposedly at a military base in Venezuala. Then there was the undersea coral scenes when they were supposedly diving the Orochno River in inland Venezuala, then there was the fish that ate a house, then there was the special forces hero fighting off the piranha with his feet, and then of course the love story. We laughed just as loud and long the second time through, and voted as a group on favorite worst scenes! For the cheap price of a used DVD, you get a great couple of hours of entertainment.",0
Boston Biker: I'm very happy with the bike trainer. I'm getting the cardio work out I wanted without leaving the house. Easy to mount the bike and not noisy enough to be a problem. I think it's well worth the cost and didn't break the bank.,1
"Life Drive great concept - poor software reliability: The Life Drive - with lots of disk storage - is a great product concept with extremely unreliable software. Unlike the Palm IIIx and earlier models with the rock solid Palm operating system and Graffiti handwriting recognition, the Life Drive frequently locks up and crashes. The Grafitti 2 software has very poor recognition (as well as being less intuitive than original Grafitti), runs slowly, and often cannot recognize ""T"" and ""L"". With an unreliable digitizing pad (which causes characters to breakup and be read as other characters), text entry is an exercise in frustration; on average characters must be entered twice. Mine is being returned for repair for the 2nd time in 18 months but it has never operated anywhere near satisfactorily.",0
"The Secret review by JB: I like the physical presentation of the book including the size of the book,letterings, and colors of the pages. I especially like the different page printings. It is very easy and relaxing to look at the pages. I have only gotten about 1/3 through the book and I have mixed feeling so far. I think the basic idea of the book is the ""power of positive thinking"" of which I am a firm believer.....as of now I am finding it hard to get back to it but will finish just because that is the only fair way to really access the book for myself.",0

"A memory from childhood: I received this book when I was little from my mother's high school friend who moved to Sacramento when I was a child. I must have read this book a hundred times. The story is very compelling and I started thinking about this book when I saw the trailer for the movie ""Big Miracle."" It has inspired me to give this book to my soon-to-be nephew for his upcoming birthday. I hope he loves it as much as I do!",1
"How to Ruin a Perfectly Good Novel: The first 200 pages of this book are a fantastic journey into the world of post World War II Brooklyn. The beginning of the novel is captivating with a great plot and interesting characters. However, the author destroys his own book with the worst ending of a novel I have ever read. It seems as if the author was so massively confused about how to end his book that he just defaulted to magic. If you have a book that is perfectly grounded in reality, introducing a magical element in the last two chapters is the worst possible decision an author can make. Everyone would like to solve their problems with magic, but real people find real ways to solve their problems. Thank you Mr. Hamill for disenchanting me.",0
"Disco Classic Dud: These are not the original recordings, but a group called the Soul Disciples. If you want the original songs by the original artists, don't buy this cd.",0
"This product is discontinued!!!: After purchasing and receiving this product and taking off all the tags on the dragon because you HAVE to cut off the tag and open the plastic to get the code to log on to the website and when I went to the website I was shown the following message ...

....roight: Gee...I paid $8 to see soft core porn.I feel so violated...anyways the horror scenes looked fake or were to dark to see. Very obvious movie and well.....preeeeeetty bad. Every person I know who watched it said..wow...that sucked. The idea behind it was good. But the actually script was well..lacking a movie concept. This movie isnt even worth the money to rent it as a new release. Either wait till it goes into the old movies bin or just dont waste your time(download it illegally or summin). Go see Saw 2...now that was GOOD!,0
"Good season: This season like the previous season was funny, romantic and enjoyable. I like this actress and story line. Good 2nd season",1
"don't do it!: I own a Mac PowerBook G4. Bought this to transfer pictures, and it almost always crashes my laptop-or any other mac I have used it with. Piece of junk. Other ""memory sticks"" or ""flash drives"" seem to work fine with my computer. Throwing it away. Wasted money.",0
"avoid: For anyone thinking of buying this , DON'T !!! It's a horrible record with no soul. I met this singer once and she was a total con with her phony attitude . This is like the start of the whole Spice Girls , Britney , Christina , Jessica era of pop music that killed the music business AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!",0
"Awesome.: This Hot Pot is the greatest invention ever. It's pretty portable, and it's great to have around when you want to quickly make tea or have a late night snack of ramen. The concept is just amazing. Whenever I'm feeling too lazy to leave my room to go to the kitchen (I live on the 4th floor, and the kitchen is on the 2nd), I use this pot, and water boils in a matter of a few minutes. It's super quick. You can even MAKE ramen inside the pot and control the heat knob. Just make sure you unplug the pot when you're done boiling though, otherwise you can boil the water dry, and that's not good.I'm really glad I bought this pot though. It's a college survival essential.",1
Stupid Movie: All I can say is this movie is not worth what I paid for it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I am very disappointed.,0
"Our kitten eats the pellets...: We have a 9 week old kitten that we recently adopted from the local pound and she's been eating the pellets, which we think is causing her to have diarrhea. We just discovered that she's been pooing under the coach as well. Maybe Feline Pine is good for certain cats, but not this one. Also doesn't seem to absorb the smell very well......UPDATE: It turns out our kitten had coccidia, which was causing her diarrhea. Perhaps she was eating the pellets because of condition - I'm not sure. We stopped using the product in any case.",0
BRAVO!: Great acting and directing make this tragic movie absorbing.This viewer definitely recommends this to any Julian Sands fan and purveyor of vampire fare.,1
"one of the best movies of all time: this is one of the best films of all time.great cast, great directing, the story is very real like,and its very chilling",1
"So much camera for so little money!: I bought this camera to replace my old Fuju A200. Having already owned a Fuji, I knew mostly what to expect in terms of quality, but the enormous leap forward from the A200 to this is like going from DOS to a fully integrated Windows environment. This camera is small - you can fit it in most pockets - but it can do almost all the things a fancier camera can. The digital zoom is great, and the internal settings which allow you to select different shooting conditions, ISOs, and even take video amazed me. The LCD is big enough to see clearly in most conditions and can be set brighter or darker as you need. I never once missed having a viewfinder. Honestly, I cannot think of anything bad to say about this camera. Try it, you'll LOVE it!",1
"A predictable formula: This book is so predictable. The dialog is unnatural and repetitive. I love animals, but the huge emphasis on the two dogs in this story adds to the air of unreality. Romance novels are not by definition ""reality"" reading. However, this book does not even have a gripping story and is poorly written in comparison to other writers of this genre.",0
"Vista compatibility depends on Vista version: When I bought this drive, I had Vista Home Edition installed on my PC. The drive was not compatible and Vista kept saying it could not locate drivers to install it. There are no such drivers available on Western Digital's website nor anywhere else I looked on the Internet. I later formatted my computer and installed Vista Ultimate Edition. When I plugged the drive in, Vista found it immediately and installed it. It now works flawlessly.",0
"Time to play the OVERWEIGHT game.: Have any of you guys actually seen triple h lately. The man is obese. I have to admit before he left on his four-month vacation, back in June 2005, he was in pretty good shape. Then he came back to the WWE on their special homecoming episode in October 2005 and man he was huge. It looked like he was the one pregnant, not Stephanie McMahon. It seems like triple h has been having too many burgers and not lifting enough weights.It seems to me, that the only thing bigger then triple h's ever-increasing waistline is his gigantic nose. I think it's wrong for a guy like triple h to write a bodybuilding book since he is so terribly overweight, its like Stevie Wonder writing a book about bird watching. He needs to spend more time in the gym and less time at the WWE buffet table.Overall, I did not like this book because I have no interest in bodybuilding what so ever and I'm straight. By the way the cover to this book is so GAY!",0
"Works as advertised: Taking one pill on an empty stomach should have an effect, if so try taking the full two pill dose next time, if not then I suppose it won't work for your physiology. If it does work for you as it does for me, try experimenting with combing it with other nootropics such as Lion's Mane, l-theanine, etc... I suspect I'll continue to use this in some form.",1
"Spend a couple hours of your life with 7 vile people: Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell. Isn't stalking hilarious? And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen? I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson, who have been fighting over her for the entire film, that she just wants them ""all to be friends"". To which they both reply the classic cinema line, ""Ehhhh... ok.""",0
"Bad Software: I bought this Hard Drive based on the One Touch OS Backup feature and the price. The Drive seems to work fine, but like another reviewer, I get a ""Allocated Memory Fail"" Error. There are newer versions of the software available on the tech support website for the software, but I get a ""bad block"" error when trying to install the newer version. I have emailed Tech support to try to resolve this problem and their only suggestion is that maybe I have a cluster size set too small on my Hard Drive. (my Hard Drive is NTFS with the default cluster size of 4k, this backup software seems to only work if the external hard drive is FAT 32 - this may be causing the problem - I don't know)The File backup feature seems to work fine on the software.I will be returning this and buying an Iomega external HD, as I have a friend that uses the Iomega and is very satisifed with their drive and software for full OS backups.",0
"False advertising: As mentioned by other reviewers the set does not actually include a ""digital copy."" The claim is simply false. The requirement to install a viewer and enroll in services is the worst kind of bait and switch. Digital Rights Management run amuck. And to say that you get a digital copy, when in fact you get a digital stream should be actionable by a class (for any aspiring JD's out there). UltraViolet is no great deal for consumers and should probably be shunned. I returned this falsely labeled product and cancelled my pre-orders that included ""UltraViolet Digital"" Copies.Years ago Sony used music CD's to install root kits on PC's, that was actionable. Sony had to make users whole. Time for Warner Bros. to do the same.For the record, as a fan of comicbook movies, SF and fantasy, I rate the movie 3 stars. Though a quick look at the reviews shows a wide diversity of opinion. The movie is watchable and has some merit, but compares unfavorably to the better comicbook adaptations.",0
"Extremely noir; great acting but hard to take: I've sat through many rough movies over the years, but I actually had to fast forward several scenes in this one, such as ...SPOILERS coming..........the main character, Lou Ford, beating women to death.By the end of the film, you may well feel as if you had been beaten black and blue.It's only Ford's deputy sheriff uniform that protects him, for a while, from being suspected as the killer that he is. Casey Affleck is frightening, while the other cast members do solid jobs in their supporting roles.This is a strong and rather extreme example of film noir, much more violent and unsettling than most of these films are.",1
"Down from the Mountain: Live Concert Performances by the Art: I want a Refund! I have been a Bluegrass fan for 50 years but this DVD is a sad representation of what was advertised. For example, Johnny Hartford was once a fabulous banjo player, but in this DVD, his talents are confined to dialogue & chatting about the old times before he became a guide on a Mississippi River Boat! In fact, most of this DVD was down-home chatting in the absence of any form of quality sound. Video quality stinks and sound quality and content is terrible. This is no Eric Weisberg (Deliverance)equivalent! I don't know what the other reviewers have been watching but they should check out the Bee Gees or something else with decent sound & video quality!",0
"A disappointment, the music is great but the vocals detract.: Musically, 10,000 Maniacs without Natalie Merchant is still 10,000 Maniacs. This new CD demonstrates the band's intelligent approach. The music is polished and some of their best. Unfortunately, Mary Ramsey, while obviously a talented musician, does not have the vocal ability to lead a band. There's a little too much vibratto, too much clarity, too much ""made for contempory easy listening radio"" in her voice. The band needs a dynamic lead vocalist, and unfortunately, they just don't have it on this CD. It is a huge disappointment.",0
Stick with the NYS Preparation Guides: The Barron's LAST and ATS-W book was not at all helpful in preparing for the exams. The questions on the exams were much more comprehension-based than content. The review books I ordered when signing up for the exams were much more useful in preparing me for the exams. Stick with those!,0
"Happy grilling; Sad cleanup: I purchased this reversible griddle because I did not want a teflon coated cooking surface. Dr. Mercola recommends enamel covered cast iron, so I was excited when I found this product. It cooks fine, but the clean up is terrible. As a result, I haven't used it but a couple of times - once for turkey patties and once to grill zucchini. I used olive oil on the griddle to keep items from sticking and cooked at a low temperature, but it didn't seem to help much. I didn't have a big problem with the items sticking, but it left me cleaning for a long time! (I'm still working on cleaning it from the zucchini!)Did mention this is twice as heavy as a normal griddle?",0
"Such a waste of $: I can't believe I used this product and didn't do my research! I research EVERYTHING before buying and just figured I'd save about $20 by getting this cream... I now have a red bumpy rash all over my jawline and neck and I have great non-sensitive skin. It is starting to itch, what the heck do they put in this stuff? I thought (similar to another's review) that the bumps in the beginning were just part of the regeneration process.. but they won't go away. I am tossing this product immediately and strongly recommend that you do NOT buy it under any circumstances.",0
"Stopped working after 1 year: I received this alarm clock for a gift and at first really enjoyed it and waking to the Natural sounds. However, after only a year, an internal LED started flickering - very annoying at night - and then the digits on the display started disappearing. It progressed to where you could not turn off the alarm nor snooze it. I am disappointed that a $70 clock wouldn't last for more than a year.",0
"excellent: Excellent product, especially when you exploit the free conversion facilities out there like calibre - to allow PDFs to be converted into .mobi!",1
"Don't buy this product! It broke 5 weeks after I bought it!!: I have waited a very long time to but a Chi hair straightener because of the cost, just to have it break five weeks after purchase! I am so disappointed! I only used it a handful of times. It also stopped heating up this morning after making a loud pop noise. I have been unable to reach the company that I bought it from, so hopefully Amazon will help me out with this situation!",0
"You'll also need a hand-mixer and a good repairman: In the beginning, my KA worked very well for large batches of cookies and mixing huge cakes. HOWEVER it only worked for large batches. Things like pancake batter, a single coffeecake, 2 egg whites, and whipped cream don't have enough volume to mix in the KA. You'll need a handmixer if you don't want to stir those things up by hand.Another huge problem is that the thing broke. For the price of this KA, it should be reliable. Mine didn't even last a year, and I cannot find a repairman. Phone calls to KA yielded the information that I'd have to drive 3 hours over the mountains to get someone to look at it and see if it can be fixed. We can only use the mixer by constantly sliding the power level back and forth with one hand, while whacking the KA on the side with the other hand. My daughters are willing to do that, but I am not.",0
"Anglican mayhem: Theodora Braithwaite, intelligent and conscientious deacon, and descendant of a long line of bishops and clergy, brings her understanding of cathedral politics to the complex personal and political currents and possible motivations for the murder of its new dean. She also brings a thoughtful conscience to the disparities of gospel proclamation and practice in the Anglican church.This author knows the Anglican church in all its liturgical, theological and political details, but her love and knowledge do not blind her to the shortcomings and failures of the church as a representation of Christ with us.",1

"Don't be fooled!: I bought this cd for five dollars and that was about how much it was worth! The songs are NOT performed by the original artists, rather by some cheaply recorded fill in. The cd is also strange because it combines traditional romantic love songs with songs about a parent's love for their child, etc.",0
"Speedometer Pyramid: I purchased this speedometer on 8/18/2008 and when it got 57 miles on it, It quit working. The needle went all the way around and has not worked since. I would not purchase or recommend this product again.",0
"read it or weep.: If you have a girlfriend, If you have a boyfriend. If you have a wife, If you have a husband. If your thinking about getting a boyfriend or girlfriend. And If you are married or thinking about getting married, or thinking of asking someone to marry you. If you are having a problem with a mate, or if your mate is telling you that you have a problem, then you need to read this book, it is a great eye opener. You will see things from their side and get ideas that might help in a relationship. You will learn something, maybe even about yourself.",1
great product: Purchased this item for my 18 month old who loves doing sumersalts I love the colors and she enjoys takeing it apart while I put it back together. One I find something I really like I dont even hesitate on the price. My daughter will be able to enjoy this for a long time. Her lab husky dog loves sitting on it. the dog hair does not stick to it.,1
Cheap & Poorly made - would not work.: I bought this for a long plane ride so I could charge an MP3 player. The plastic on the small end was warped so it would not plug into the plane socket. Complete waste of money because it was unusable.,0
"don't have great expectations for this movie...: This movie stunk. There is no point to it. Ethan Hawke is awful... his only expressions are confused and more confused. I guess when you get too many stars up on the screen, the movie tends to lose something, eh? I'm sorry I even wasted the money to see this in the theater.",0
"Poor reliability: What a Piece of Junk!: I opened the box yesterday and I got several problems after then. First of all, the installation CD is bundled with ton of software and it took more than 100MB just to install the driver I really want, I don't understand why HP forces the user to install so many garbage products on user's machine?! Once I installed the software and wired the cable properly and then tried to print, most times it didn't work at all and keep saying paper jam. I then called HP product support line and they didn't solve problem at all.I used Epson and Canon print before and never find any problem. Shame on HP for producing such a poor product. Save your money and buy other products!",0
"Waste of money: Bought this trampoline for my son whom is only 90 pounds, had it for about 3 months and the bands snapped and the springs came off causing him to get hurt. I had noticed that other bands are starting to break also. This product is not safe at all.",0
"Mildew, Mold, Dampness: After owning this safe for two years, I do not recommend this safe. I regret using it because it damaged my things. At first I was happy, it was a simple safe to protect documents and photos.I soon discovered that a significant amount of moisture accumulates inside. I have tried desiccant packets to remove the moisture, however it builds up in large amounts very quickly. Now everything I had in there is damp, moldy, and smelly. :-(",0
"USED to be good: I have had this product for a little over a year now and it is terrible. I don't know if it's just a defective chip or anything, but it really got me mad. When i first got it the thing worked fine , but in the last couple of weeks it has been horrible. The signal strength has been either low or very low and i am constantly losing internet. I tried to call tech support once and it gave me some Indian guy that I couldn't really understand. Not only that, but all he did was tell me stuff i already knew like click repair on the connection in My Network Places and restart the computer. If they are all like this one that I have then I reccomend not getting this item.",0
"Toro Ultra blower/vac: Been using my ultra for three weeks now and the vac part is better than expected! It will easily vac up dried leaves and dried pod type leaves with seeds off my gravel desert landscape yard. You can get very close to the leaves without worrying about sucking up gravel! The magnesium impeller does not have any nicks at all yet,though I did purchase a replacement just in case. Love the variable speed control as well. I highly recommend this product.",1
"Adorable: I bought this for my 7 year old and he loves it. It operates great, just like a real vending machine. I originally got this because I thought it was a good way for him to put money in a bank, but you don't need to put coins in it. I highly recommend this. It's so cute.",1
"WOW!!! Wonderful voice and songs!!!!: This is a fantastic album of Goldfrapp...probably it's the best!!! She's a wonderful and sexy voice!!! My favourite songs are ""Ooh La La La"", ""Slide in"" and ""Satin Chic""!!!",1
"A real nailbiter: This is one of those domino movies, where one small action sets in a motion a long tumbling of dominoes, with one thing leading to another and, finally, to an inevitable disaster as the developments play out. There's a certain Fargo-esque quality, given the snowy Minnesota setting. Billy Bob Thornton gives the most memorable performance as the slightly dumb drunk brother of the college educated feed store clerk, with the third plotter bringing up the rear. At its heart is a question of how far people will go for a large sum of money. As usual, here and in countless other movies with the same theme, the answer is way farther than they should.",1
Absence of Lyrics Makes Song Book Un-Fun: I noticed the review that the book was without lyrics and thought I would enjoy the songbook anyway. I did not. It just isn't fun to play without the words.,0
"Witty, funny, and bizare: The Gothic, and mediaeval meet up with 20th century warfare. This unique and bizarre W.W.II novel is told in first person by each of the obscure characters as they move between chapters: from a group of fun loving, lost in their own little world U.S. Army Privates, Sergeants, and Lieutenants, to the stubborn, quirky Major and his Captains who are set out to defend a castle, that happens to be caught at the crossroads of the German counterattack in the Ardennes. And it wouldn't be a castle without a duke; he and his wife help to tell this surreal story.Witty, funny, intellectual----borders on the ridiculous----is there really a war going on.Wish you wellScott",1

"Optima BlueTop Cranking the Boat Tunes!: I decided to step up to an Optima battery in my 2006 wakesurfing boat this year...never really had an issue with the stock battery, but I wanted to ensure that there would never be an issue, plus I just installed a Perko battery switch to allow me to dedicate as much power as possible to my boat's stereo! We normally shut down and float with tunes for hours, and the last thing you need to have happen is A) get stuck without a battery, and B) get stuck on the water without tunes!The battery came 85% charged and I put it on the slow trickle charge and it was fully charged within 15 minutes, so I'm ready for the water! Now...if it will only stop raining here in Vermont to get out and enjoy the lake!",1
"gosh... you shouldn't have: I guess the generous folks at Universal felt it was time to give music fans another gift, so they yanked all of Fairport's albums out of print and left us with this worthless collection...The albums have been reissued in the UK, but unless Richard Thompson gets a guest spot on TRL, I'm guessing they won't be over here.",0
"All i n all great workout,but not much warm-up or cool down.: I saw the videos dec,98,thought they were fresh, new, motivating.I came from almost 10 years of Martial arts, so for me was pretty easy to enter in the swing of things,then when Billy came to Miami in january 99,I took all his classes,and I was appalled to see ,that for such intense Workout,there was little or none warm-up:Dangerous!Other than that, great workout!",1
"Ten Thousand More?: I loved the movie, but what I am curious about the most is why Lord Aragon allowed the ""Ghost Army"" to leave when they were facing another Ten Thousand plus army as they did the first? That didn't make any sense!!!!!",1
"Art Asylum USS ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-A: This 16"" enterprise ship is my very first star trek toy which i've just bought it on 4 October 2003. It is very impressive and enjoyable to me. It's a must star trek ship for collectors.",1
"extremely meaningful: I recently purchased this album, and it is awesome!! Ryan is a very talented song writer. All of the songs made me think because they had so much meaning to different points in my life. My sister recently passed, and the song ""Hit Me with Your Light, really hit me emotionally because it described our relationship. So if your ready to experience great beats and inspiring words go out and Buy ""You Stand Watching"" you wont be disappointed!",1
"Just poor quality cable: This cable is terrible. 3 months of use, probably 20 gigs, and it's done. stopped working, and i opened up the connectors, and all of the solder joints were barely attached. really thin gauge wire too.I expected a LOT better from Audio Technica. I bought it specifically because i didn't want a crappy, no-name cable. I probably would have been better off with a no-name one.",0
"broken binding: I know the cost was very low, but as soon as I opened the package the entire cover dropped off the book. bad bad shape. This kind of information should have been shared before I bought it.",0
"Great Price, Fine Product: I had my doubts about buying this product since I was unfamiliar with the brand. So far I have been using it for a few months and it's held up being switch around as my home theatre grows.",1
"Probably the best Budd/Eno team-up album of all time: Even more than ""Music for Airports"" and ""Plateaux of Mirror"", this album is the definitive collaboration album from the Budd & Eno archives. A groundbreaking classic of the ambient genre, this disc just gets better with time, especially in an era when the New Age and ambient genres have been overrun with imitators and dilettantes.Subtle, gorgeous piano and synthesizer work features throughout, with a richness and emotion that is hard to find on other ambient albums. When it comes to ""relaxation"" tunes, this one has the field beat, and I've spent many an evening, in bed, under the stars, with my wife or alone, letting the quiet, spare beauty of this disc spirit me away from the troubles of the everyday world.Anyone seeking to find the roots of true ambient should look no further. Budd & Eno were doing it long, long before most others, and they were doing it with a style and a gentle grace that has come to typify their collaborative efforts.",1
AWESOME!: This is one of my all-time fav. soundtracks! I bought it in June 1998 and I'm still listening to it! 'One' by Filter is just awesome! 'Walking after you' and 'More than this' are wonderful songs that describe Mulder and Scully really well. I also love 'Deuce' and track 13 and '16 horses'!!! Really great work!,1
"Look for others: The review is presented by a brief discussion of a disease and a care plan follows arranged according to priority. A CD also comes with the book. I can say that this disc really simulates the test coz the test stops if it determines your passing. But over all, the book is boring and is ineffective in helping you retain the lessons.",0
"very pleased: I am very pleased with this ring. It was a lot larger than I had anticipated, but it came quickly and was packaged nicely. I would definitely purchase from this retailer again.",1
"As fierce as it gets: I have purchased ten copies of this book, and I imagine I will be ordering more, to give to all of my artist friends. This is a powerful book that inspires the reader to take bold leaps in their creative journeys...it has become my artistic manifesto!",1
DEVIL'S EMBRACE: Bought this due to monther's request. She read this book ages ago when I was still young. A must have!,1
one for the record books: I knew Heigle would suck but I had no idea the casting of the men would be so wrong too! I couldn't sit through it. The book had such great potential as a cute movie but this movie really failed.,0

"Trash: This card is complete trash with design flaws, buggy software, and lack of support. Doesn't want to talk to my other wireless devices using 64biut encryption, only 128bit works. The windows driver won't work unless you're an administrator, and there are no Linux drivers in sight. Mine is going back ... today, and I strongly recommend anyone not to buy this junk.",0
"Very, very good: I bought this CD mostly because of ""No Place So Far"" which has gotten alot of radio play and because this CD is getting high praise from other reviewers. I was pleasantly surprised that, despite the fact that the musical style is a little too popish for my normal tastes, I really, really like this CD. Lyrically, this CD is very good. Erin and Brad O'Donnell are clearly very gifted song writers and their talents are particularly evident on songs like ""Only You"" and ""Hold On To Jesus."" In addition, Erin's voice is remarkable and although I really liked it on ""No Place So Far"" she sounds better on some of the other songs on the CD. I suspect I'll be listening to this CD for quite some time.",1
NOT HAPPY: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR BUSINESS USE.THE VOICE QUALITY IS VERY POOR AND THERE IS AN ECHO!USING THIS PRODUCT WITH AN AMPLIFIER DID NOT HELP QUALITY.,0
"Not impressed.: Not a good can opener. I was really looking forward to having a can opener on this spork which is as good or better than a GI P-38. I have been disappointed. I feel that I was generous in giving it two-stars, however, I may have been majorly let down due to my own hype and hope of it actually being something decent. I spent a LONG time trying to open a can. Also, I prefer titanium. I'm not a huge stainless steel fan.",0
"Really Dumb!: Sometimes a movie is so bad that it is actually fun to watch . . like THE BLOB or INDEPENDENCE DAY . . . but this one has nothing to save it. Full of clich√©s, including a Cheney-like VP, global warming presented as absolutely the origin of the disaster, the good guys surviving . . . something resembling credibility was needed and was missing. Even the ""special effects"" were not special. Don't waste your time on this one.",0
"Don't think 'deluxe', think 'small': It's no surprise that Rand McNally produce large print versions of some of their road atlas books: the so-called deluxe version is small in size and content. The maps are too small to be useful for driving purposes. The book contains predominantly half-page summaries of major US cities. While the cities are well covered, the atlas section is poor. I bought this to replace an older version of the basic Rand McNally US Road Atlas and wish I hadn't bothered. The spiral binding is a useful feature but what use is an open page if you can't see the maps?",0
"Only worthwhile cartoon now on nick: Nick cartoons have really gone downhill lately, EXCEPT for the Avatar. It's an excellent, extremely well-written, beautifully animated series that is very engaging, dramatic and funny all at the same time. It is clearly well-researched, and serves up lots of Asian wisdom, not just a lot of silly platitudes. I love this show. Hurray for the AVATAR! I can't wait to buy the complete series as a Christmas gift for my kids (and me!)",1
"Bad spring mechanism, bad packaging.: This item is designed to work as it should. However there is a spring mechanism that holds the wrench together to make it work. This spring is very flimsy at best, doesn't hold up to the slightest of tension. It will go out of shape with the slightest tug. I found it very difficult to unwrap the package without damaging the spring mechanism because the shrink wrap is totally wrapped around the product and spring. Once you pull of the shrink wrap, the spring will get bent and the entire wrench becomes useless.Of course right on the package itself is a replacement part number for the spring. How convenient, it must be a part they want to sell a million of because it'll keep getting bent/twisted and become unusable. This spring should be made from heavier duty material that won't bend out of shape so easily. If this spring mechanism is improved on, this product will be 5 stars, however as it is now, this is only a 2 star product.",0
"The best source of hands-on apps programming on the Web!: Rick Strahl really knows his stuff and it shows. The chapter om IIS setup helped me understand how to set the Web site server parameters better than I could with any other book or info (MS included!).This book clearly explains the different ways to create applications that do something useful on the Web. It details ASP, ISAPI and COM with lots of easy to follow Visual FoxPro code examples.It also discusses at length using VFP as a client and server using HTTP as your network.I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about database programming on the web or using the internet for your app distribution.",1
"Started out great, then burst.: Brian Freeman writes well and the story's pace was pitch perfect. I liked the first twist (even though I saw it coming) but the twist at the very end was awful. It's like the author cheated. I don't want to give any spoilers so that's all I'll say, but it ruined the whole book for me. Also, the sex scenes were poorly written. I'd rather have no sex scenes at all than have them written that way--more like technical instructions than passion.With that said, I'll definitely give Freeman another try when his second book comes out. I just hope he doesn't toss out another ending like this one.",0
"Don't buy it!: Where do I begin? . You must press 2 buttons to make it go. Every time. Very frustrating. It does not have enough power. It's difficult to clean compared to the Kitchenaid. It's painted plastic. It's not chrome. For the money, it is just not worth it.",0
"Simply didn't work: I purchased DirectTV for my other TV's, thought I could get away with an amplified HD antenna for my third, limited use brand new HDTV. I can't get anything better than fuzzy pictures on any channel no matter how many different directions I point the thing. This is on the second floor of the house too.....",0
"Warm bread: Small footprint. As long as you follow the instructions, the bread comes out warm and delicious. We already experimented with new recipes and as long as you watch the proportions, it works. Only complaint is the white writing on a yellow background, which may be esthetically pleasing, but very hard to read. Overall worth every penny.",1
"Chaplin is on trial once again and this time convicted.: For anyone who has read David Robinson's definitivebiography on Chaplin there is nothing new inKenneth Lynn's ""Charlie Chaplin and his Times,""unless you wish, as the author seems to, that Chaplinwas convicted for all the crimes he was actuallyacquitted of. The author attempts to support hispreposterous thesis that every move Chaplin evermade was either a conscious or subconscious responseto his mother's mental illness. There is nothingabout creative or technical process here, only a 1920'sprudishness and '50's red-baiting mentality. Many ofthe author's interpretations of sexual symbolism inChaplin's early films are truly not for the squeamish.",0
"Eating Pro IC70: Product met all of my expections. I wanted something beyond light duty and I got it. When funnel is mounted on top of machine it will not slip under kitchen cabinet. That is the only one slightly negative aspect, but is easily solved by pulling it off and putting it in the ice drawer. Fun to use and finally...no more half-moon ice cubes! No regrets having purchased.",1
Scammer: I found the original posting for this item being sold at $7.71 with $10.99 s/h You bet I jumped on that deal and this scammer refunds my money and tells me it was a mistake. Amazon needs to hold these idiots to the fact that the customers should not be penalized for a market sellers mistakes.,0
"Not true: This movie was well done, no doubt. But it's not true. Based on Joseph Merrick's own autobiography, he chose to enter the world of fairs and shows to earn his own keep so that he wouldn't have to return home to his step mother, who was abusively mean to him. He was very close to his real mother, though. He was not able to hold obtain a job because of his appearance, and people thought he was stupid because of the way he looked. But when he joined the shows, he said that he as comfortable there as he was uncomfortable before. (His words, not mine.) I wish they had followed the true story better, and at the very least used his real name instead of calling him John.",0
"This card shuffler is a complete waste money: What a piece of crap. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. I was really excited to get it in the mail, and I fired it up immediately. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get it to shuffle 1 deck of cards most of the time, let alone 2. When it did shuffle, it was lousy, I shuffled a deck a couple of times and got the same card on the bottom twice. Stay away from this and buy a more quality shuffler.",0
"Far from perfect, but well worth seeing: The story revolves around a team of news people who are covering the war in Sarajevo and the rescue of some children from an ophanage. It tries to say something important about a war and a place that was practically ignored. I've always been interested in learning more. This movie doesn't answer my questions. I'm still confused about the difference between the Bosnians and the Serbs and why they were fighting. But I did get a feel of the place which I never quite got before. And as films go, the story is a patchwork of pieces and not put together well. Woody Harrelson and Marisa Tomai are in it but their parts are quite small. This is far from a perfect film. However,I'm glad I tracked it down and saw it.",1
"THE *BEST*: I don't usually like latin music, but this is an exception! I totally recommend this cd to anyone and everyone. UFF's songs totally relate to teenagers and they're catchy. Even if you don't understand, you'll definately enjoy... They're the next big thing since menudo!",1
Caroline smiles like sunshine: Oh man! You should take a good look on the girl who played Miyo. Caroline Junko King! That was so impressive and eye-catching! But most of all.....man! she's so baeutiful! You should show more pictures of here in this website so i could see more of her often! Puh-leeeeezze! I'd be honored if you show pictures of her cause she smiles like the beautiful sunshine,1
"Excellent bargain, well worth the money!: This is an excellent neck machine without the big price tag of a professional or gym machine. The small footprint allows it to sit in a limited space and the weight is just right for an easy or extended, harder workout. If your gym does not have a neck machine and you need one this is the one for you!",1
"Beautiful Planet - Germany & Austria - Blu-Ray: Save you hard earned money, the cover is miss-leading, the content lingers on the same subject mater seems for ever.",0
"Essential Genesis work: Trespass(1970) is Genesis' true debut. Even though Phil Collins and Steve Hackett have not joined the band yet, they still manage to piece together some good stuff. Anthony Phillips is a great guitarist and this is his last album for Genesis, sadly. John Mayhew, the second drummer, does a good job until the real drummer, Phil, comes in. The album starts with LOOKING FOR SOMEONE which really isn't a great start because it is mostly just dark and mysterious. WHITE MOUNTAIN is an excellent border between peaceful and fast. VISIONS OF ANGELS may be the most beautiful song on the album. STAGNATION is the best song on the cd as it is peaceful, mystical, dark, and mysterious. DUSK is the lightest song on the album that's sounds a bit like Gregorian chant. and last but definitely not least, THE KNIFE, a powerful song that wraps up the album beautifully. This Genesis album you should definitely own!",1
Bad Quality: This is really shoddy. One rod broke after the drying being used less than one month. Bad Quality.,0
Not The Pirates of the past: I feel that this sequence was put together fast for the money. It was not at all the quality of previous Pirates of the Carribean movies.,0
"Don't buy this CD: If you don't buy this CD then I can get all of them to give to my friends as presents. DeFrancesco is a genius on the jazz organ and trumpet. His renditions of these standards and original tunes are unsurpassed in power, eloquence and sheer technical ability. Expertly recorded and designed to be played through a good system at a moderately high volume, this is a happenin', boppin' recording. Remember, don't buy it...I'm trying to get them all!!!",1
"Poorly Written and Predictable: Because I had heard that ""If Only It Were True"" was a bestseller in France and will be a Spielberg film, my expectations were high. Boy, was I disappointed! The writing style is horrible, and the dialogue sounds completely unnatural. Perhaps it lost something in the translation from the original French. If not, the author should consider returning to his job as an architect. I certainly hope that Dreamworks gets a decent screenwriter to clean this up for the film version. The plot is silly and completely predictable, and I confess that I only skimmed the second half to reach the ending because the awful prose and dialogue annoyed me. Don't waste your time with this one.",0
"very comfortable, love the fact you can reverse it: Its very sturdy & has great quality in the fabric...I know it will last me a long long time..plus I can reverse it.",1
"Wish you could build your own digital door alarm?: I too purchased this book, not through Amazon, but saw the reviews and thought I'd put my two cents in here. I tried unsuccessfully to put this together with my two sons. They sat there patiently as I read through the book and constructed the alarm. It was a real disappointment for all of us to not having a working alarm in the end. I then wound up rebuilding it a second time, again with no success. I took the book back to my local bookstore for an exchange and after a third attempt, still no working alarm. By now, I have hours invested in this project. I too tried to email the company and my message was bounced back. My neighbor has a working version of this that he and his son put together some time ago. My feeling is that the newer copies of this book may come with a defective alarm, which makes sense why the older review in this group is positive while the more recent reviews are so negative. I think I'll try to get my money back.",0
fatal fury the motion picture: consiterin that this vido was my 4 encounter with anime i belave it was well drawn . One problem i had with it was the lack of voice talent due to the fact that some of the actors wher used for othe voice such as ward perry did billy kain and geeas howerd,1
A great dramatic TV show which can be enjoyed by the entire family: I caught this show on Netflix's first and then had to purchase all the seasons. Every episode held my interest and I was surprised to find that it was not dated at all.I enjoyed Kris' relationship with Wildfire and the way it wound through the entire series. The characters were believeable and likeable without ever being sappy. I would recommend the entire series to anyone...and I have done so to all my friends.,1
"Bravo!: Charming and beautiful, Frances Mayes' ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" captures the spirit of Tuscany in wonderful flowing words. I could taste the wine and the food and see the olive trees in her terraces. I've fallen for Tuscany. Other readers may hate this book, but this one made me feel good. Life is beautiful.",1
"Another forgettable and boring band: This disc found its way into my home and turns out to be indistinguishable from any number of other generic, boring, unoriginal bands. You can certainly find many, many better albums. Try instead checking out anything by Elvis Costello or Ben Folds Five or Marshall Crenshaw or...",0
"hard to clean: this is very useful for holding a lot of stuff, and to separate my toddler from hot water coming from the faucet. however, since it has stuff in it, it is a mold cesspool. it is also very hard to clean, with tiny ridges all over it. the major source of mold are the deep ridges where the two parts slide together--which was originally a selling point for me, since that's what makes it adjustable. i cleaned it twice, but both times it took at least half an hour, since nothing really works well to get into those ridges. we also don't put plastic items in the dishwasher, so that is not an option. i am now looking for a wire basket that i can stick in the dishwasher from time to time.",0
"A must if you own even one Hamilton Electric: If you collect Hamilton Electrics, or if you have some in you collection, you'll love this book. It even includes technical manuals for the two electric movements",1
"No sound, no LED display --: This unit worked for about nine months then just stopped! No sound and no LED front panel displays -- just total silent. I thought that like most electronics devices, once it got over its teething period, it should be OK for awhile. But not this Toshiba. I just hate to put it in the trash bin but this will be the case since it is not worth to repair. Really a waste.",0
"Very elegant piece.: I'd say Rochereau and Franco had a good thing going back then. I still prefer either one on his own, but still I'd go for this cd, no question about it. This album gets a high rating as it deserves.",1
"Flaw: Loud Noise Warning: This item is fun and the LED display is cute.But there is one badly designed play pattern. According to the accompanying manual, you should pretend-play with your infant by putting the phone to your ear and pretend you're having a phone conversation. It also suggests handing the phone over to your infant to also pretend to converse on the phone. That's all fine... except if you do it as the phone is automatically shutting off. When it's in the process of shutting off, the phone will ring. If you then place it next to your ear to pretend to answer it (as I did), you will be greeted with a loud ""BYE-BYE"" that is significantly louder than any real phone that I have ever used. I was surprised by its volume and I would not recommend letting kids place the phone to their ears when it says that. (But how will anyone remember when it's safe and when the voice will shout in their ear?).",1
"Item returned: I didn't want to rate this item because I did not use it. I had to contact the seller about returning it, because the hinges were broken off. Petco has a policy where you can return/exchange to a local store, but since the item was broken the seller requested that I just dispose of it properly. I then shopped in the local store and purchased an item that was unbroken and more appropriate for our need in addition. This item in the store looked very sturdy, I am not sure why the one I received was broken in the manner it was. Seller was very fair in customer support and solving the issue of the broken item. I would definitely buy from them again.",0
"kinda boring: living in the back woods of maine, i'm familar with logging, so i thought this show would be good. sorry, but i find it boring to watch them haul load after load of logs up a hill.i really enjoy extreme catch. and ice road truckers. ax men is a bit too slow for me.",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS if you have a Mac!!!!: The content browser software ""QPict Lite"" does not work.The manufacturer, IMSI, has no free tech support for this problem.They have shipped a broken version of the application. If you download the trial version of the full QPict software, it works fine.IMSI is shipping broken junk and they won't even talk to you about it unless you pay them!!!!!STAY VERY FAR AWAY FROM THIS ONE!",0
"Wonderful book and worth the time and money ! Siempre Selena: I was sceptical about buying this book at first, considering that isn't an official biography. But, I must say I WASN'T dissapointed. It was wonderful. It was well written, well organized, and gave Selena the credit as a singer and human being that she deserveed. My only vice about it is that is makes her father seem like a controlling freak, when the only thing he was ever guilty of is loving his daughter. Other than that, this book is most definitely worth the money. If you love Selena, you'll love this Book! :)",1
The Maintenance Man: Michael Baisden hit home in this one. This is the first book I've read of his and it is good. It truly is worth reading!!!,1
"Know how to use it before you buy it: I bought this thinking I could place it on the page of the book and it would be magnified. Wrong. You have to hover it over what you're reading in order for it to work. Would not have ordered it if I'd realized that. It's okay for looking up phone numbers or reading the small print, but not for books, which is what I wanted it for.",0
"Nice Tribal Progressive House. But expected a bit more...: Most of the songs on the cd are amazing except for 2 which arent really my type. Some of the songs might start up really good from the beginning when u start hearing the voice and drums kick in, but some of the songs might start up average and as the music goes by it turns really good. so basicaly like in a club u usually hear the best stuff as time goes later.Bottom line is, this is good progressive house but for that price i expected a bit more. But thats just my thing, dont hezitate to buy this!",1
"not much help: I was expecting a turn key guide - I just didn't see it in this book. This book had some good info but not detailed enough for me - a lot of high level, basic, common sense information. I have been a landlord for many years and own many properties. I wanted to use this book to tap into the lease-options market - I will need to keep researching. I am actually a little upset I purchased this book - it was too expensive for what I got.",0
"JUNK: I GOT THIS PHONE 6-9 MONTHS AGO, IT WORKED VERY GOOD AT FIRST, BUT NOW WHEN I TALK ON CORDLESS PHONE NOONE CAN HEAR ME, I AM REDUCED TO USING THE SPEAKER PHONE. PANASONIC'S CUSTOMER SERVICE REALLY BITES, THEY NEED A LESSON IN CUSTOMER SERVICE 101. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE, U CAN DO MUCH BETTER WITH YOUR HARD EARN MONEY!",0
"Junky!: This camera is by far the worst camera I have ever had. The flash is way way way too bright. I had to rig the flash to get it dimmer. The shutter has some type of delay. If you want a camera to get a quick picture of your kids when they are doing something cute, steer clear of this one! You get what you pay for!",0
"What I feared, and expected: Always trying to find something new and interesting, and with all the accolades this band receives, I decided to give The Strokes a chance. And like so many before, I was left unimpressed.Unlike other reviewers, I fail to see how this band can be considered revolutionary. Uninspired, repetitive, and whiney 3-chord rock was pioneered well before The Strokes came around.High praises demand high performance, and unfortunately, the search for the next great rock band will continue.",0
"A Favorite for Long Distance Runners: My son loved finding this in his Christmas stocking, and reported it worked very well during the last half marathon he ran a few weeks ago.",1
"Cheap, cheap...cheap.: Go for the better quality. These are too cheap and I'm sorry I took the cheap route. I haven't even bothered to put these in service. They fall apart just by looking at them.",0
"Very Happy: Never thought I would invite people over to look at my hot plate, but I do this one. I especially like the feature that turns the plate off when the time is up, making it great for pressure cooking. It does have a small fan underneath which makes some noise when it is on, no real problem, but it does not run absolutely silently.",1
"A Waste of Time and Money: My old D-Link router was giving out after several years, so I bought this one as a replacement. What a disaster! The set up program kept crashing during set up, so it took me almost 6 hours to finally get the darn thing working. It worked fine for a week or so. Then I kept having problems with all of my connections (notebook, netbook, wireless printer, PS3, and Wii). It got to the point where I had to reboot the router every time I wanted to get online, play a game, or print anything. Buyer beware!",0
Even I could do it!: I visited Andrew's restaurant in Toronto and wanted to duplicate the unique taste of his Asian cuisine. I made quite a few dishes and they were delicious! His recipes were written so that even a novice such as I could successfully complete a meal-- and it was fabulous. You have got to try it!,1
"Works really well: I'm new to building Cat5/Cat6 cables but having watched a couple of videos online I heard people say that crimping down a couple of times is a good idea. So I always do that. I have yet to have issues with a cord that I'm able to blame on this crimping tool :) ...usually if a cord doesn't work after I'm done it's because I put wires in the wrong order or didn't push them all the way into the RJ45 ""end-peice"".Feels like solid build quality.",1
gel gloves: I bought theses for my daughter and she loves them...They fit great and are very comfortable and they were the best price we found.We received them within days of ordering them.,1
"Large and very colorful photos: Full information. Very good selection. Not like other classic books, some even includes Ford Tarus, this book contains all real supercars. Wonderful collection for all automanias and scale model collectors.",1
Love this guy!!: Yes his humor is too RAW for some people but I find him to be a breath of fresh air. He tells it like he sees it and I find I usually agree with hiom.,1
"Great Seat!: I really love this seat! Of course it is rather large, but it is meant to fit ""big kids."" I have just ordered our third Regent today, because our 2 1/2 yr old has outgrown her Evenflo seat. We have two other Regents for our 6 and 4 yr olds. We have a Dodge Grand Caravan and the seats fit just fine. The kids always comment on how comfortable they are, especially on long car trips. I feel so much better knowing they are safer than the standard booster seat. My youngest is excited about getting her very own seat soon!",1
"wrong part: Amason said this part would fit my truck when I ordered it,However when I tried to install this it would not fit my truck. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it was the wrong part. Returned item for a refund. well made cover, good crome finish, great price, too bad it fit my truck !!!",0
"Not even close to the picture shown!: My friend and I run a preschool called Noah's Ark, so we are always looking for new ""ark"" related items to display. I was very excited when I saw this adorable birdhouse and couldn't wait to have it as a Christmas gift for our classroom. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to discover a colorless, birdhouse covered in so much moss that you couldn't even see the structure. The item delivered to me is a sad representative for the one pictured in the photo. I am relatively crafty so I have opted to keep the item so that I can fix it to my liking. However, for anyone who wants to order the object shown in the photo...forget it and look elsewhere!",0
OLDIES: I love oldies. This disc helps to complete my collection. I still need to get a few more. I need to listen to them more though.,1
"Sorry it works with XP: I have had this joystick for as long as it has been on the market, it has migrated for a 98 comp to ME, to XP with out a hint of problems. If you had problems with this Stick the problem must have been your comp. or you! It is to bad that Microsoft hit in some of the final nails in the flight sim coffin with it withdraw from this market.",1
"Pretty good while it lasted: I was pretty happy with this phone, especially considering how little I paid for it in April '04. One thing I particularly like is that the LCD displays a message when one of your other phones is in use. The illuminated keypad and backlit LCD are great. Though I really didn't use it, the handset speakerphone can be useful. The phone did not conflict with my Wireless G network. And--believe it or not--the handsets use standard AAA NiMH batteries; not expensive proprietary battery packs.But after a little more than a year of use, the phone has stopped working. I have owned a lot of cordless phones (VTech, Uniden, Panasonic, Sony, etc.), and the only two that have worked well AND lasted are both Unidens. So I'll be replacing my defunct VTech with the comparably priced Uniden DTC 646-2.",0
"Re-issue: This is merely a re-issue - at a new, higher price - of the original 1928 Okeh recordings. I wrongly assumed that this was some new find. It is not.For those not familiar with these recordings made before Mississippi John Hurt disappeared into the obscurity of sharecropping in Mississippi for 40 years, they are worth the price.",1
Healthy Treats!: These are very appealing to my small dog. They are a healthy treat and I also appreciate the fact that they are make in the USA. I can highly recommend this product.,1
"Garbage!! Bottle Leaks, Cheap Pads!!: I bought this a few years ago and thought it was absolute garbage. The cleaning pads they sell to go with it hardly pick anything up, they dry out within 30 seconds of mopping, not even enough time for me to sweep my small, small kitchen. The bottle of solution also leaked all over the place. Tried to fix it, but realized it was just garbage so It went back to the store. I have had bad luck with Swiffer products, have bought 3 or 4 of them now and I don't understand what the hype is all about. It's JUNK!",0
"in reply to the Doc: yeah your right, they don't make it to be 100% to the ""T"" accurate...it's suppose to be inaccurate, it's a sitcom. a t.v. show. UN-reality.The show is sad, funny, happy, moving and disturbing all at once. No one wants to deal with a death of someone they know or love, this show is meant to open that avenue of how some deal with it...but exaggerated. It's not meant to be politically correct. It's meant to entertain, which it does quite well.If your looking for reality and complete accuracy...American Idol is still running I heard :) I'll stick with what ""shows"" where started for to begin with, entertainment away from reality.",1
"Close, but no cigar.: While I appreciate that Rae Lawrence sought to warm the hearts of a public who missed Susann's original characters, this book (like ""Scarlet"", the ""sequel"" to ""Gone With the Wind"") is proof that some things are indeed best left alone. The characters in this work seem very flat, lacking the emotion, depth and vibrancy that made ""Valley of the Dolls"" such an enjoyable work.Anne, Neely, Lyon are all relegated to plots that are the fodder for typical romance novels that aspire to be good beach reading: adultery, Hollywood, death, a genre well done by someone like Jackie Collins. However, in Lawrence's text they seem only to be placed in these situations. The reader is given very little insight into any character's motivation or emotional reaction.And then there is the unfortunate ""second generation"" sub-plot.If you feel this is something you must read, please check it out of your local library. Your money will definitely be better spent elsewhere.",0
Wonderful show.: We saw this once on TV and my daughter just had to have it. This is where we got the best price for it.,1
"Cult movies , bad quality: All 50 movies are cult classics but the only thing bad is the sound quality, sometimes you just cant understand what the characters are talking about they should at least put subtitels, but thats not a big problem because the movies are fantastic.It realy pays to have this movie pack!",1
"Just because its popular doesn't mean its the best...: ...Or even very good, sometimes. I never liked this video. My two babies and later as toddlers would never watch it. The signing was just ok and not, in my opinion, good enough if you actually want your child to learn and use sign language at home. The animations were uninteresting and even I never could sit through much of it. Instead, I would recommend the Signing Time seriesSigning Time! Vol. 1: My First Signs DVDfor that purpose. My niece and her family very successfully learned to sign using these videos. While I never owned them, they used to come on PBS on Sundays and all of us (husband and 6yr old daughter included) used to watch them. I love the Baby Shakespeare DVD but was incredibly disappointed in this one.",0
"Where's the Monie?: This group is one of the worlds best kept secrets. Why has noone actually taken the time to produce these young men so the world can hear some genuine music? With all of the junk music that is out there ""Monie"" needs to be heard. There talent can compete with any of the groups out there. Such as Boys 2 Men, 112, Jagged Edge, N Sync to name a few. Are there any serious producers out there that would take the challenge to bring this group to the light? I could bet that they would make great music and (Monie) beyond compare. If you want to hear potentially one of the best kept secrets in the world, hear ""Get At Me"", and decide for yourself. I like the fact that they are not the usual rap group that cusses and disrespects women. There hip hop R & B style is refreshing, yet is music for the world. Big Willie K.C.",1
"No DaVinci code here: I don't know folks. I found this book to be slow, dry and repetitive. The basic idea was very interesting but it was not well developed.The story had great potential but it never quite made it. I would not recommend this book.",0
"Dreamer: A feel good movie. The area you see in the picture is outside Lexington, KY, an area I am familiar with from living there and driving the road where the rock walls have stood for over a century. I've not lived in the area for 40 years so watching the movie brings back memories. Even if you have never been in KY it's still a good movie",1
"Authoritative, easily understood introduction to daylilies: Diana Grenfell's guide to growing daylilies covers daylilies from 551-479 BC to the present. She clearly presents a broad view of this beloved perennial, with excellent insight. From cultivating to breeding, terminology to forms, colors and cultivar recommendations, this book is as good as there is on the subject of daylilies.",1
Hook-On High Chair: A great product for my Grandson when he visits. There is no high chair to move around.,1
NOT GOOD: does not tell you how many you get it shows you all of them but you do not get all of them you only get 1,0
Good Movie: Nice late night movie for me. I liked it. Good action and story. Some of the effects and sets were also well done.,1
"AWESOME doll!!: My daughter LOVED this doll! She asked for a UT Cheerleader Barbie for Christmas, and I had no idea there even WAS such a thing!Doll was delivered quickly and in mint condition.",1
"Buy ORGANIC and then NUKE it into OBLIVION: I agree with the other reviewers who cite the authors' numerous contradictions and extraneous information, this book could have been improved with some judicious editing.There is one disturbing piece of advice in the book that I would like to draw attention to: the author continually recommends using a microwave to defrost and heat baby food. This is extremely counterproductive, why spend the time and money making organic baby food only to nuke it in the microwave and degrade the nutritional content? Microwaving breaks down the molecular structure of foods making them harder for your body to recognize and digest.No, microwaving isn't the greatest evil out there, but in a book devoted to nutritiously feeding your baby it seems quite conspicuous!",0
"Good night picture but monitor breaks easily: Fuzzy reception, but night vision is better than another system I bought after the monitor jack broke. Regarding that power jack... it'll break very quickly depending on how often you plug and unplug it (or stress the plug when its in). I've had to open it and solder back down 3x. Batteries don't last long so you have to use the plug!If you buy one, just keep it one place. Otherwise, I guarantee you the power jack will break within a few months.",0
not the original but....: ...Mark of the Astrozombies is an entertaining romp that could only come from the twisted genius of Ted V. Mikels. I laughed until I cried! FANTASTIC!,1
"Censored: This is a review for the blu-ray, not the special.The blu-ray is censored. No option given for unscensored. Waist of your money. Who wants to pay for beeps!?",0
here is a good idea: all this book can tell u for tricks is where to put your feet and you're never gonna magically get good by reading.,0
"A Neglected Niche of Civil War Research Is Filled: Professor John O'Donnell-Rosales has compiled a comprehensive listing of Hispanic Confederate soldiers and naval personnel.This work will be beneficial to both those of Hispanic origin interested in genealogical research as well as Civil War students looking for further details on the true composition of Confederate forces.The idea that the Civil War was fought by armies and navies made up only of Caucasian forces is factually incorrect. Minorities participated on both sides in many different roles. This book documents one of those areas in a very informative, effective way. I recommend it!",1
"Keep rollin: Loved the series and love the DVD. I am A 53 year old woman who loved watching Mushie and Wishbone and Gil and Pete in the 50's. 20 years ago I lived in San Deaigo and taped spme of the episodes off TV, now I can't wait to have the entire series on DVD,",1
"This is the best book, very informative: This is a must read for everybody interested in preventative health based on biblical truths.",1
"My second purchase!: This is my second purchase of this cushion. I left my old one at a meeting and I seriously cannot do without it. I have a larger firmer one for my couch, but it is way too thick for driving and I have a had time reaching the pedals. This one is perfect for the car or to take with me to meetings. It is not too high and gives me great relief while driving short or long distance trips. I have a thin med height frame and weigh 110 lbs. I know some others complained about flattening but my husband has used it and he is 210 lb, as well as my son at 170 lbs.",1
"worst book ever: I have read some other books by this author and found them to be ok, but this may be the worst book ever written! The characters, story line, and dialogue were terrible and extremely unbelievable. Don't bother picking this up. It stinks!",0
"A life saver highly recommended: If I don't have anything to keep my 3 year old busy - this does it all the time. He never gets bored of it and for the price you can't go wrong. How many expensive toys with lights and buzzers end up in the garage but play-doh is everywhere, they just love it. And Mom and Dad can have fun too.",1
Sent to wrong Address!: This product was misdirected by USPS so didn't arrive at my home for three weeks after the promised date. I did not accept it and hopefully was credited. I would love to have used it but by the time it came I had purchased a different one.,0
"Worthless...: Bought this lemon after 20 seconds of consideration. A better title would be 'Selected Readings in Parasitology for the Armchair Academic'. No relevence for the practicing clinician(I'm in Quillabamba Peru). No diagnostic/exam help, no organized format from chapter to chapter, medication prescribing information spotty, nil use of art/drawings(maybe 6 'plates' thrown in the back pages). Change your 190 bucks into small bills and make a fire on a cold day, a far better return on investment.",0
"Bought A Second Pair: This is the second pair for our house. My 13 year-old son didn't like the buds for his iPod, so he bought these. He also uses them to watch movies on his laptop. My nine year-old daughter borrowed them and also liked them much better than the ear buds. Hence, pair Number Two. Much more comfortable and better sound.",1
"History is written by those who have hanged heroes: Why did I ever watch this movie...So much tought was put into how to make the Serbs look as much as monsters as it can possibly be, that you, misses Jolie, forgot that acting is what makes a movie believeble. And why not spend more time developing the characters and show their inner war in all that madness, if this was a story about love in a time of war. But no, this movie was made with one purpose only.What pains me the most is that 95% of the viewers will learn about history trough movies like these... I'm sure that events presented in the movie did in fact happen, but when you don't show what the other side did, are you really presenting the truth, if that was you goal, or was it?",0
"Krenz, Castle or Quick (her pseudonyms): I read all of her books. Have not been disappointed yet. This one about the girl who asks the tycoon to marry her (temporarily) and to keep her brother's electronic co. going is another winner. The bother has died in a plane crash, but she doesn't believe he is dead.",1
"Come over here preppy.: This is such a sentimental movie. I love how Jenny and Oli bond and go through their problems together. It is so well done and the music is breathtaking. I love it and I think the ending is so realistic and it made me cry, which is a hard thing to do. Do yourself a favor, and rent this movie!",1
"An Important and Influential Work: I read this book several years ago when I was just beginning to explore metaphysics. I didn't understand everything in it; the book is rather technical and quite esoteric. Nonetheless, it was a fascinating read, and the book affected me on an energetic level in ways I cannot explain. I was just beginning to open to channel around this time, and reading this book bumped up my vibration and opened up my frequencies in remarkable ways. Few books have ever had such a profound effect on me. I believe it was a crucial tool on my path to becoming a channel myself.",1
"Walt Disney's Treasury of Children's Classics: The book was supposed to be ""brand new"" and for the most part looks new but inside the cover is writing from a person that was giving the book to someone.",1
"Like Trivial Persuit, only not as good: I bought this game for my sister because of the good reviews, but I regret it now. Some of the questions are hard, but a lot of them are pretty easy so you win really fast. We played two games and after getting a few really hard questions wrong, I answered about four easier ones right and won the game before anyone else moved. The same thing happened the next game, only someone else won in about 5 minutes. Its a bad knockoff of Trivial Persuit and that's about it. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",0
"Don't Buy These Scissors, They Don't Work!!!!: Black&Decker; SZ360 3.6-Volt Ni-Cad Cordless Power ScissorsI bought 2 pairs of thesescissors because I thought I finally can get all those"" impossible to open"" plastic packages opened easily,and I thought how great they would be for my art projects, cutting fabric, etc. No such luck, they worked forabout a day, cutting easy things like paper & fabric (if you hold it perfectly taut). As I read in another review, it never did cut the blister packages, not even it's own!!! It just kept locking up when you tried to cutthings. It would not even cut thin foamboard!!! Now, it has just died on me, no movement at all. It would be a great product if it worked, it doesn't!! Kim White",0
Worthless peice of stress: So I bought it thinking it was all good waited until my Xbox subscription expired and I entered the code on my Xbox and I get an error message saying the code is invalid!

"cute stuffed animal: i got this stuffed animal for my nursery as it goes with the safari theme. i wouldn't consider it much of a toy you play with but maybe something a child of 4-5 could tote around, or you just use as a decorative stuffed animal for a kids room. the only downfall is that it does shed a lot, but you can tell from the image that it has long strands, so it wasn't too much of a surprise. very cute, :x",1
"Not perfect but very good DVD set: This is a great idea by the History Channel: putting 10 documentaries (each are 45 minutes long) on one DVD set. The DVD set is not perfect but it's a great addition to a collection. Out of the 10 documentaries 8 of them are really good, while 2 of them are really horrible (UFO cults, UFOs of the 70's).My Question is: Where is the ""Unexplained"" episode about Alien Abductions ?? This show was a classic and I don't understand why it's not included on this DVD set.But this set is still very good, and at this price you can't go wrong. :)",1
No Headset Jack: I purchased this item through amazon partner circuitcity.The extended techinical information about this phone is incorrect. There is no Headset jack. I wish I had gone to panasonic official site to confirm this. For me no headset jack means this phone is less then useless. I find it very strange that a phone of this price does not have headset jack. Needless to say I will be returning this phone soon as possible.,0
"do not buy this book: I purchased this book, read it from cover to cover, and cannot say that I found one piece of good information. Refering to examples of imaginary children? No medical training much less ANY college degree? Links to dehydration? Do Not Buy This Book! I would resell mine, but I'd rather be out the five bucks that it's NOT worth than give it to anyone else to read. Do your research! ezzo.info",0
"Another fine piece from Kerouac: In Tristessa, Kerouac writes about his time on the road in Mexico City. The book is broken down into two parts, a year apart. It is a sort of love poem to Tristessa, the morphine addicted prostitute that he is in love with.In true Kerouac fashion we once again live vicariously through his vivid writing of his experience on the road. His ability to bring the reader right into the middle of his world is the reason I keep coming back to him again and again.",1
"Not bad, but it tended to drag in parts.: Simply put, this movie was a little slow. It felt like a few themes were left unexplored or unresolved or maybe I was just too bored to notice they had been resolved. It looks like the trailers over-marketed this movie as they commonly do with Clooney films. If you're a diehard Clooney fan, this movie might be a subpar diversion.",0
Weak cup of Coffee: I was very excited about getting this machine only to discover that all varieties of K-Cups that I ordered produced one of the weakest cups of coffee that I ever had. I was able to return it but could not return the 100 Kcups that I purchased with it. Very disappointing.,0
Machine Gun Preacher: We were blown away by this movie!!! Great courage to do what called to do thru such difficulty and danger!!,1
Great Technical Analysis Manual: It is my opinion that William Jiler does a great job explaining technical analysis. Pattern explainations are backed by wonderful chart illustrations. Not only is this book a great tool for understanding technical patterns but Jiler explains why these patterns form. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in technical analysis.,1
"Best Information about Political Process of World War II: This book was a massive dose of how the politicians and business men who coordinated the war thought. If you are interested in politics of President Roosevelt, then this book is for you. It is also a great book to do a report over for a history class. It is both very easy to read and to understand.",1
"Chuck is basically defective: I bought one of these over a year ago. The chuck recently failed. It will no longer lock, no matter how much I fiddle with it. I thought, at this price range, I'd finally be buying a drill that would last.The chuck is pretty bad, even when it works. Good luck getting it more than a little tight.Other than the chuck, it is a pretty solid drill.",0
Huge Fan - Lots of Laughs: I have been a huge fan of Jeff Dunham since his first Comedy Central special aired. This DVD does not disappoint. I recommend it to everyone. It also makes a wonderful gift for someone with everything.,1

"Poor Quality: If you possibly can, avoid this stock pot at all costs. The pot itself is cheap, poor quality, and lightweight which causes it to slide all over the burner. The lid is atrocious. Looks like and feels like it was made from recycled soup cans. As the previous reviewer mentioned the handles do get hot another indicator of poor design. There are much better choices.",0
"Anyone can slap a cross on their chest ...: Anyone can slap a cross on their chest (or attend church) and claim to follow Jesus. This book gives the reader a much deeper insight into what Jesus' life actually represents. Jesus did not judge people. Jesus used nonviolent civil disobedience in a determined effort to bring about justice for the poor. He opposed war and a corrupt state. He befriended and advocated for the poor, the sick and the downtrodden. His ultimate aim was Love. In short, Jesus was an extraordinary activist in his times. And by extrapolation, the book intimates that if we are to truly call ourselves followers, then we too must actively engage society and seek justice for all. Highly recommended if the reader wants an authentic understanding of Christ.",1
"Carlosroco: As a big fan of Molotov, I was very dissapointed with this record, honestly dont waste your money on this record.

"great guide: i'm currently a pharmacy student and we used this book for our class. every chapter is easy to read and gives you every step along the way to the answer so you can pick up on how to do it without that much of a problem if you've never done it before. since taking the course, i've used this book as a reference several times to do my every day coursework and answer some other questions that i've received outside of school. you can't go wrong with this book or the one by Ansel.",1
"Limited Edition??: Would like to know from the informed or Disney themselves, if this is going to be a limited release? As with their ""Scarecrow"" release it was gobbled up by sellers on this site and others, where now you have to pay thru the nose for a copy of ""Scarecrow."" Same has happened to ""Secret Agent Man"" and the ""Prisoner"" sets.Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (Walt Disney Treasures)Secret Agent (aka Danger Man) - The Complete Collection Megaset 2007The Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40th Anniversary Edition)All these sets are overpriced, especially in todays hard financial economy. If any one knows please a provide your response as I would like to pay a fair price for these items without having to pre-order before the item comes out. I like to read the reviews after the items come out to see if my hard earned dollars should be spent. Nuff said!",1
"Another strong soulful organ-based CD by the Sanborn sideman: Ricky Peterson is a musician's musician. Although he has had a handful of recordings under his own name (on Warner Brothers and Ben Sidran's Go Jazz label), he is mostly known as the soulful and groovy organ player from David Sanborn's band. He is also known as a successful producer (Prince, Paula Abdul etc.)This record continues the Peterson sound, organic, groove-based soulful songs, with understated arrangements, featuring Ricky's soulful vocals on about half of the tracks. Guest musicians include David Sanborn, Hiram Bullock and guest vocalists. As opposed to his earlier solo records, the Hammond B3 dominates this CD. Really nicely mixed and produced. If you like Sanborn, Ben Sidran, or groovy keyboard-based jazz/soul - check it out. (And while at it, if you like it, check out the long-deleted Night Watch, which is probably his best CD so far).",1
picture not accurate: the photo looks great. Too bad what i got had slivered almonds - not a single whole almond in the box!don't waste your money. the picture looks NOTHING like what they send. They should have to put up a photo of what it really looks like. they wouldn't sell any!!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED and feel cheated,0
nice addition: Purchased for my dad for birthday and we all watched it. The effects are great and make the movie enjoyable to watch.,1
"Sounds Like Violence.....sounds great: Another awsome band from the good people at Deep Elm. Sounds Like Violence hail from Sweden and represent their country well. Grittily sung, sometimes shouted, lyrics with an almost sad, but frustrated undertone. I cant quite compair SLV to any other band I've heard....but I'll try. Picture early (EARLY) Cure meets My Chemical Romance with just a touch of heavyieness. Awsome heartfelt words meshing wonderfully with emotionally played instruments...pick this one up NOW, you wont be dissapointed.",0
"BLAH!!: I bought this saw for home use and had incredible difficulty cutting a straight line through 3/4"" plywood (even with a fence). The saw is very light weight and seems flimsy when trying to cut. It tended to pull to one side and was hard to get a line of sight correctly. When I finally got it to cut a straight line I noticed the saw was at an angle and the base was crooked. After messing with the base to get it straight, I still had the same problem. The blower works but it all ends up in your face. Spend the extra money for a better saw!!",0
"light and warm: Excellent blanket, amazingly light and warm. Some static problems but only when first spreading the blanket over the bed. I bought the king size and cut it in half to make 2 twins that work just fine.",1
Bull: This book is a pile of pants. The closest Paul Bruce ever got to seeing action was when he fixed army cars in N.Ireland. The publishers should be embarrassed for going to print with such a poor book which is full of lies.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,0
"Cuts thru the thickest branches!: Great for heavy work or regular square hedges, a little large for detail work (if you are trying to trim your bushes into circus animals).",1
The game is junk: i buyed this game it work fine then a week later it stop working i toke it back and brand new the touch pade dont work and all it come on tv screen is vtech when game is on the system. I tell others beware ware of produce. It not the coast of 49.95 on store shelf at walmart or any weres.,0
"great for the younger kids: These are ideal first puzzles for children. All the pieces are the same size and shape, so the child can get used to just putting shapes into a puzzle place. But then each piece matches it's corresponding animal/vehicle/etc by color and the design or pattern on the piece. I wish I had a video to show you of how excited my little 14 month old nephew is everytime his puzzles are pulled off the shelf. Hours, no joke, of enjoyment. He can't get enough. And he is learning to put puzzles together.",1
Delightful: John Ardagh is a very perceptive and cultured person. This book is an ideal reference if you want to find out about France and the French. Every country should have a book like this one written about it. This is serious reading coupled with just beautiful artistic writing.,1
"Not what I thought it would be: I didn't like this book at all. Emeril is not a genius. He might be a fair cook, but he isn't a genius. This book was nothing but a bunch of pictures of him. The recipes were less than average. I may try to return it.",0
"Music for the 12 year olds: So this is what all the little boys and girls listen to while the adults listen to Venom.

"Great for around a Dog!!!: I bought 2 of these units after my wife started having problems breathing, after we got a new puppy. We placed them in the rooms she's in the most. Her breathing problems have pretty much cleared up at this point. The units are a little noisier than our other units, but they are sitting higher (4' and 6' off the floor). But they are doing a great job for keeping down the dog dander. Thanks",1
Most boring movie: So slow and not exactly sure what the pot... I mean plot of the movie was. Don't waste you time with this one.,0
"Some good, but some bad too: The good is that this book does not overwhelm you with flashy pictures like a lot of Physics books do. However, the book loses 2 stars for too many typos. It seemed like every week I would get an email from my professor with corrections to the problems. I'm docking it another star for some sections which I think could have been explained better. The chapter on semiconducters was not very englightening. I had to read another book before I felt comfortable with the material.If they ever make another edition of this book, I'm sure it will be great, but this one is just a little too rough around the edges.",0
"Very Poor Choices: Well, lets see, I didn't like the songs it chose as the ""top ten"" and the ones they did pick sounded like they were recorded off of an old record or something. It didn't sound like how those songs sound on the radio at all. Over all a very poor collection. Lets set our standards a little bit higher guys.",0
"After Reading All That Negative Reviews...: I decided to delete this product from my Wishlist. I was planning to use these with a BMW 335i i.e. a low car, but reading how these got wedged under a car, most likely damaging the side rocker panels, I was no longer in the mood to buy these not to mention the ""projectile"" issue. Thanks but no, thanksI will get conventional metal ramps.",0
Don't buy it: It is sharp. It is cheap. But it is almost impossible to open with one hand. I was able to open few times with one hand but almost broke the skin on my thumb.So don't buy this one for a everyday carry knife. I own many knives by the way. Spyderco is the best but a little more expensive.,0
"Zircon STUDSENSOR Pro LCD: Who tests Zircon products? This piece of gosa has given me all of the problems I read of in the reviews, indicating studs where there are none and no studs where there are studs. Hope someone lost their job over this product's development...",0
timeless evil: The woodcuts in this book leap out at you with a ferocious and violent intent. I've seen the originals and the reproduction job here is nothing short of superb. It's hard to believe that such visions of the apocolypse come from Germany in the early part of the millenium. You can't miss this book! The engraving book is also way kool.,1
"An excellent book, covers most everything you need to know.: I got this book at Interop as part of a package, attending Professor Held's lecture they gave me the book. The book is really good, it covers IP and Frame Relay, telephonre operations and shows how to transport voice over both. It even includes examples of economic analysis that I found extremely usefull as I had to do this to get my project approved. The only area where improvement is required is that Professor Held's lecture included many practical application notes concerning latency that were not in the book. By the way, he provides his email address and responds to requests, so he might provide you with this usefull information.",1
"Dewalt Diamond Blade: I thought the blade worked great. I did find out after I had purchased the blade and angle grinder that they (Dewalt) recommend a 2-sided shield to attach to their grinder when using a cutting blade. I needed it for making curved cuts in 1/2"" porcelain tile and I was waiting on the item to complete the job so I put on goggles, mask and ear protection and went for it. You will definitely need to wear a mask and goggles and blow out your grinder periodically with compressed air as it creates a lot of fine dust. The blade cut through the tile beautifully - I made a few passes so the blade would not have to work so hard. I had tried cutting the tile with other diamond-tipped jigsaw and rotary tool blades and nothing compares to the efficiency of this blade and the grinder.",1
"Willful? Or being a child?: I was given this book by a helpful relative. Please read with a grain of salt - some of the ideas, like hitting a child with a small belt or paddle if they do not stay in bed, and then telling them you love them, are really off the wall. Bedtime is one of the most precious times in the world, and the idea that you would hit a child with anything as you send them off the sleep has to be wrong. We have had to deal with this on occassion and find the ""Nanny way"" works best, little talk, be firm and put them back in bed.would not recommend this book to anyone.",0
Disappointed: This soup has no flavor. Broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. I was so disappointed.,0
"Excellent product: I have tried most of the different types of space heaters out there for our unheated laundry room, but this one is by far the best. I set the temp I want and the fan on auto and it does the job quietly and efficiently and it is not an electricity hog. You can put your hand against it anywhere and leave it there with barely a feeling of warmth. If the room were not a comfortable temperature, I would't think it was on. What do I call it? Perfect.",1

"Simply Brilliant: It's amazing how well Sherlock Holmes translates into the 21st Century. I credit this to outstanding stories, and a stunning cast. The world's best known detective is brilliant in any era it seems.The fact that they've adapted this to the tech era is bold and fresh. I wasn't sure how well this could be pulled off, but I don't think it could have been done any better.I find Sherlock to be riveting entertainment. I can't wait for more, and wish for a very long run for this series.",1
"There are MUCH better choices: This printer was a gift(and I am grateful for the thoughtfulness), but darn it, if you're looking for a great deal, this one isn't it.1. every time it prints, it cleans the printer heads, wasting ink.2. it goes through ink quickly and you can't just keep on printing if one it out. Nope, it has to be replaced.3. You can't op NOT to print in color on the printers menu.4. Replacing 6 cartridges costs more that the printer did.I wasn't very impressed with the quality of the images it produced. I still love my Deskjet, and we've been using that instead.The one thing I do like about it, is that it feeds small items better.",0
Nia video: Cheesy program....not worth the DVD it was burned on.... Had I watched this when it first arrived I would sent it back.....,0
"Horrible quality. NOT what you'd expect from M&D!: About a quarter of the wooden letters were not sanded down at all, had sharp strips of wood chipping off the back, or simply hadn't been cut out fully. We even received the tiny inner parts of some letters that were supposed to be discarded before packaged. Had I not been there with my daughter when she opened the toy she could have gotten some seriously nasty splinters.",0
"A GREAT SCI-FI SHOW AND A GREAT LOVE STORY: First off, the dvd set is wonderful, everything works as promised. An amazing amount happens in the three seasons. Fortunately the writers were actually able to bring a very cool ending to the show when they found the show was cancelled. So the show runs from season 1 to season 3 quite smoothly. I am a male, and I really like the love story element in the show. Roswell is unique in its ability to bring off drama, suspense and comedy all in the same episode. You will not regret buying this and it is nicely priced, especially compared to such sets as Farscape and the last 2 seasons of X-Files.",1
"One of my Favorites: I would have to place this work on my top-five list for thought provoking books. The author does an excellent job weaving modern scientific thought with ancient biblical commentary. It is done in such a way that the reader finds the connection between the two topics to be much stronger than would be shown by other contemporary views on the topic.As with other books like this, I would encourage the reader to approach with an open mind as well as a bit of skepticism. The author presents some very interesting ideas, some of which seem highly plausible and some of which are a bit far-fetched. I think the phrase ""don't miss the forest for the trees"" would be applicable. One could easily get wrapped up in a particular detail while missing the overarching theme.",1
"Stupid: This is a waste of money the information is VERY clear quote ""regarless of the vehicle you drive, you need to know where you are going."" you would think if you want to go to Disneyland you would know where it is or already have a map to it. my opinion dont buy this it is stupid. there is some information but it isnt worth buying. I like the "" The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland, by Bob Sehlinger.""",0

"Lousy Product Lousy Comany Lousy Service: Unit is 6 weeks old and hardware malfunctions if it gets below 40 degrees, say, waiting for a bus! Has done this 4 times. Erases all data. Have to reformat entire unit! Palm customer service refused to give me the ""advance replacement"" warranty option advertised on website (you pay [$$$] and get a replacement immediately instead of waiting for repair). Said no units were available, even though their online store said if I was buying new I'd get one in 2 days. Of course, they have my money, what do they care? Dishonest advertising! This warranty feature was one of the reasons I went with Palm. Corporate office ""customer elevation"" personnel rude and admitted warranty data on web is out of date and said they ""couldn't be expected"" to keep it current. Honest, that is what she said! Will never buy from Palm again. Neither should you. Bought from Amazon, though, and Amazon was great., shipped fast!",0
"Perfect: My parents have used instant hot water and teabags since I was born.I bought this for them so they could have the convenience of bag-like tea, but use loose fresh teas of immense flavor.

"Excellent travel book, excellent value: An outstanding guide to a wonderful state. One book, of course, cannot cover all there is about any area this big, but this book does an outstanding job for Wyoming's history, lodging, attractions, background information, etc.As for any area, it's good to supplement with other specialized topic and / or area guides, but for a general guide to a large state, this one does a great job.Logically arranged, well-written, and very readable, you can almost read it straight through; it's one of the better travel guides available.",1
"built like a tank: My mom had a pressure cooker. I remember the little weight it had on top. This is my first pressure cooker. I was initially concerned about safety so after I bought this pressure cooker, I also purchased ""Pressure cookers for dummies"". I wanted to understand how this thing worked and how safe it was. that was two years ago, since I have used it fairly regularly. I greatly appreciated the quality and the rugged construction. It is heavy. It cleans up well and is easy to disassemble and assemble. The only thing I had to learn was that I was using too much heat. It clouded my chicken stock. I would recomend that when you first use this cooker that you use the recipes in the manual first. The instructions are detailed and geared to the pressure cooker.",1
"Get it right, Amazon.: I share the opinion of the two prior reviewers: Amazon needs improve the quality of the information on its electronic books. I have the Waley, Seidensticker, and Tyler translations in paper form. What I want is the Seidensticker and/or Tyler translations on Kindle so I don't have to carry those enormous tomes around. They're both hardcover books of well over a thousand pages each--Tyler is two volumes--and they weigh a ton. From the information given about this ebook Genji I'm not even certain what language it's in, much less which translation. Ebooks, for all their undoubted virtues, are completely useless when the publication information is so bad that consumers can't even tell what they're being asked to buy.",0
"Not impressed...: I went through this cookbook after going through the new Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook and what a disappointment! Not only does this book use many pre-packaged items (if I'm making it myself, I'd rather not use that junk), the recipes were dull. Almost every recipe was in the other cookbook and was MUCH better. I also purchased the More Betty Crocker Slow Cooker Recipes and MANY of the recipes were the same--picture and all! What a waste of money. Purchase the new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook and you'll be MUCH happier!",0
Where's the whole song?: Waited almost 5 months to get this single and the live version cuts off before the addded ending starts to play. I've tried to find where there is a video on here and none of my playing devices pick it up. In fact the cd itself doesn't even say there is a video on it. Still a big fan but not really worth the money if you have all his other cds and the concert dvd.,0
"HELP!: I am a 14 year old girl and I weight 184 pounds. I'm on this diet for a week now and to be quite honest, it is killing me. I'm so restricted from many kinds of food. Since I've started I have felt alot more tired and weak. Furthermore, I have realised that I eat alot less because of the fact that I am restricted. I do want to lose wait but I just can't with this diet. If u have any ideas of a good diet please tell me! Hope to hear form you soon!",0
"The ""horsepower"" of a different color: With all the media attention on the Balkans and the Middle East, the situation on Cyprus has faded four decades into history. Or has it? 007 gets pulled into a situation when M's boyfriend is murdered by a serial killer, and as the old saying goes: ""way leads to way"". He winds up dealing with a new terrorist group dedicated to ridding Cyprus of the Turks and the more moderate Greeks. One big feature about this book is that the hostility between Bond and M has faded quite a bit. She actually calls him James a few times. Oh, yeah--about the allusion above. Remember that scene in ""Wizard Of Oz"" where the horse pulling the carriage in the Emerald City keeps changing color? They explain to Dorothy that this is the famous ""horse of a different color"". Well, Bond's new Jag does the same thing--with the flip of a switch. Beats the Aston Martin he had in Goldfinger--the one with the changing plates.",1
"shitty album with one good song: After i had heard the one single for Floored, which is ""Fly"", i bought the album.Now i know why ""fly"" was the only single. This album sounds like it was put together in about 5 minhutes. You should get their 2nd album, ""14:59"" which is a much better bargain.",0
"Carolina Moon by Nora Roberts: Good story with final twist, that I enjoyed reading. I like books written Nora Roberts and JD Robb. I will read more of her books.",1
nice and easy to use: The wooden mat is durable and the seaweed us good quality. I haven't had trouble with it at all for the month that i've had it and it makes excellent sushi!,1
"don't buy it.: I bought Frigidaire FAA055P7A Air Conditioner about 2 weeks ago. but after using 2 days, it suddenly stopped working, and it has not worked since then. I called the customer support right after the trouble, but they are still taking time to fix it, and I don't know when I can get the fixed or new one at all.",0
"Frenchman Teaches Spanish: I invested in this set based on the reviews and recommendations. I have been disappointed and have not gotten past the first CD simply because Michel Thomas sounds like a Frenchman trying to speak Spanish. I'm sure his teaching technique is fine, but his Spanish pronunciation is poor. I've had several years of Spanish in school in the past, and native Spanish speakers have told me that my pronunciation and accent are very good, so I hesitate to listen to 8 hours of Spanish with a French accent. I'd have to say opt for something else if you want to both learn the vocabulary and the proper speaking habits for Spanish.",0
"This Is Really Disappointing.... Don't Waste Your Bucks!: I am a lover of rap music. The beats and rapping in this album are lousy. I had to use the fast forward button many times when listening to this album. I spent 10 minutes listening to this junk and dumped it straight into my store room. I hope that I'll never find this album again, as it reminds me that I've wasted my precious money on this piece of junk.Don't buy this album, unless you're into weak rapping and beats. I'll recommend ""The Infamous"" by Mobb Deep if you can still find it. Compare ""The Infamous"" with this and you will know what I mean.In short, I'm angry that I am ripped off buying this piece of junk.",0
"Let there be light--MORE light, please!: This is a great idea but there are better competitors on the market, and for about the same price or a little more. The best thing about this model is that it has a positive-click on/off switch that won't turn on accidentally in your luggage. The worst: not enough light to read by. Too bad!",0
"One of my favorite cds...: What can I say about this?? Hmmm...umm...IT'S AWESOME!!! Every single song on here will totally grab you. On some of blink's later songs, the lyrics became kind of meaningless and stupid(all the small things..true care truth brings... what the hell is that supposed to mean?!) but every single song on this cd is creatively wrote. On the song, 'Wasting Time,' I swear, I spent about 5 minutes pondering the lyris:'Sometimes I sit at home and wonder if she's sitting at home thinking of me and wondering if I'm sitting at home thinking about her, or am I just wasting my time.' the lyrics are a definite plus on this cd. even the lyrics on incredibly juvenile songs such as ben wah balls, or depends. I recommend this cd to ANYONE that likes good music.",1
Not a charger nor CD player: This isn't a bad item. I misread the product description. It is not a cd player nor does it charge the ipod. I would have been happy with one or the other.,0
"A Total Waste of Money: This is an awkward, difficult product...uncomfortable to wear; troublesome to synch up; clumsy to operate. It's over-priced, ill-conceived and definitely not worth the aggravation.",0
Useless: There is no point in buying this book. The recommendations for careers are horribly uninspired and nothing that you don't already know. I was hoping for some fun and new ideas to which an english major can apply but I was disappointed. Don't bother... searching on the internet is more rewarding than this book.,0
Don't turn your back.: I wanted a small portable grill for the deck and camping. Works fine for hotdogs but not dependable for much else. Flames easily go out. I saw a lot of possitive comments and was hopeful but it looks like this grill is headed for yard sale land.,0
Don't waste your money...it does not work at all!: I would have rated it NO star if I could. I bought new battery and it still does not work. I read the instruction from the manual carefully and change my camera setting correctly. It does not work. I was too late to get a refund because I found out too late (30 days return policy) DON'T BUY IT!,0
Fun and Pretty.: We've had several sets of these beads. They are so much prettier than the plastic ones and can actually be worn with my girls' little outfits and look fashionable. Also makes a great party activity / party favor.,1
"Rent this FIRST: This movie is HORRIBLE! If you give this movie a good review that's probably because you work in the advertising department for the production company. This movie does not even deserve a B raiting, C if there is such a thing. After seeing this movie I have decided that I can direct a movie. I wouldn't even use this DVD for a table coaster. I'm not gonna waist my time telling you what the movie is about, RENT FIRST!",0
"this product is different with the image: I ordered this item two weeks ago, and received it. I assumed this product is a Japanese one since the picture, but it is different from that picture. I haven't used this eyebrow razors, so I don't know how good they are; however, I really felt sad that I received the different products.",0
"Junk: Oliver Stone slandered an innocent man in the film JFK. The greatest film critic of all, Pauline Kael, said Stone was a lousy screenwriter, and she's right. And Oliver Stone's response at the end of the book to Gerald Posner's book on the JFK assassination CASE CLOSED (that proves convincingly that Oswald was a lone gunman) is just absurd!! Every sin Stone says Posner committed--and in fact did not commit in most cases--Stone committed a million times more in JFK! I've rarely seen greater hypocrisy than I saw in Stone's Posner piece. If you want to read about an irrational, paranoid, egomaniac, go ahead and read this silly book.",0
"Good place to start reading Eco: Of the four Eco books I've read (Name of the Rose, Foucault's Pendulum, Island of the Day Before, Baudolino) this is the most accessible and so it's a good place to start reading Eco and get a sense of his style of writing. What I liked most about this book is that (and I can say this without spoiling the plot!) because Baudolino states at the outset that he is a liar, the reader has to interpret the truth of the text as the story unfolds. This extends the book beyond the usual one-dimensional reading of fiction. If you like books to be bigger in this way then Eco is your man, and I'd also recommend Milorad Pavic. But let's not get carried away, here's a good place to start!",1

"Magical: Crowded House - beautiful melodies sung with meaning by Nil Fun. I find it easy to relate to many lines sung by Neil, and the clever double-meaning he puts in his lyrics. His voice carries the songs, and delicate understated guitar fills in the gaps as required. For lovers of melody, this best of compilation compiles many of CH's best, yet leaves off gems like Sister Madly. You could have a double CD and still leave some great songs off, this is how good they are. Get it today!",1
"Interesting concept but poor writing: I ordered this book after finishing the last Left Behind book. Despite the strange bi-polar reviews, I still gave it a shot, because of the idea. Unfortunately, an idea is not enough. The writing is strictly third rate. I give it two stars for the idea....",0
"poor quality: The item arrived in a timely fashion. The first 45 minutes played very well with good picture quality, but after the 45 minutes the DVD begin to freeze then showed video artifacts on the screen eventually the DVD just froze and would not play. I removed the DVD and cleaned it very thoroughly and played it again, but the results were the same. contacted the seller and requested a refund and they provided a full refund. Very unhappy and the DVD has no useful purpose. It is not playable.",0
"A Must Read for Widows, Helpful for Widowers: ""On Your Own"" is a well written, very informative book. The authors are able to cover specific financial, legal and emotional issues without being too wordy or losing the average reader in technical jargon. The content is applicable to widows of all ages and financial situations.I keep multiple copies in my office as gifts for any recently widowed individuals I meet.",1
"Read it with a grain of salt!: This book is good reading for background information on a variety of careers. If you are in high school or college and trying to figure out what career field might interest you, you should take a look at this book. Most people will not be able to achieve the majority of these career paths. I am surprised that fields like President or NBA player are included.",1
"I love this show!: I wish I started watching this when it came out. I watched the whole series over the weekend and was mesmerized. The cast, the writing and character development is great. This is one of the best series on TV in the last 10 years. I'll have to wait awhile to catch up on it but I'm looking forward to it.",1
"Disappointing: Philip Margolin has made a very nice living out of writing tightly-plotted thrillers featuring well-drawn characters. Unfortunately, he has accomplished neither with this book. The plot is implausible, the characters are almost uniformly irritating, and the pace of the storytelling is confusing--all building to an anticipated crescendo, except that there is no crescendo. The book ends with a whimper without even tying up all of the loose ends.It's surprising that a book this underwhelming could come from an author as accomplished and respected as Margolin. I suspect he had a publisher's deadline to meet, and the result looks rushed, undeveloped, and sophomoric--especially compared to his earlier work.",0
Very funny show: I bought this DVD for my husbands birthday and loved it. He wants to watch more of this series I also want to watch more,1
"Good album but still not original 2pac: This album has great production due to Eminem. I just don't like how 2pac's music is being put to shame. I grew up listenin to 2pac and is one of the best rappers that ever touched the mic or ever picked up a pen. His musical style is different than what is being put out today. Johnny J should have headed up all the productions on all the albums post Greatest Hits. Sure he may have helped produce some of the tracks, but I have heard most of the unreleased material that 2pac had before it was reworked and new music put to it and I think the original recordings were great and that the only thing that needed to be fixed was that they needed to sound clear and not sounding so much like a demo tape. This album was good but not orginal 2pac.",1

"very dissatisfied: I placed a large order and paid 10.21$ for ""Don't Take Any Wooden Nickels"" by Clark, Mindy Starns... The condition of the book is very old, yellow pages, musty smelling and curled corners.If I had only paid 1 penny for it I wouldn't be complaining.. The other books in my order are beautiful....how can I remedy this??",0
"Interesting and informative...: I am soon to be a first time parent of two international adopted children. I enjoyed this book because I found it to be well written and very informative. I enjoyed not only the stories included, but also the specific details discussed within each category. The author reminds/reinforces to the reader the general factors involved with raising children while also laying out quirky specifics relating to adopted children. I am very appreciative to people such as the author who have written about their process of adopting and raising adopted children. It is fascinating and helpful and makes me even more excited about our adoption process and bringing our precious children home!",1
This Thing Kicks: This is the best thing to buy if you play MtG. I've always wanted a huge book or something to look up cards but i found it on my computer(kick).I think this is the best thing WotC has done yet besides creating magic itself. People this is like the invention of bread for magic players around the world.,1
"One of the best books I've read: Don't Die, My Love was the first book of Lurlene McDaniel that I read. I thought it was one of the most touching books I've ever read. I cried so many times when reading the book. I don't know what happened to my copy of the book, but if I still had it, I'd read it at least once every two months. I found the way Lurlene inserted the information about the illness was brilliant. Most authors would come out and say excatly what the condition was and leave it alone, but Lurlene spreads out the information in just the right amount in the right spot.",1

"Does Amazon sell ""rejects""? Poor workmanship & quality.: Not sure if merchandise Amazon gets is seconds or rejects, but my husband purchased his second pair of this style boots because the first was so good. We bought the first pair through his uniform company for $135. When he'd worn them out (1.5 years) I looked online and found them for $90 here and we ordered them.Out of the box they were fine, but after 2-3 months of wear the stitching was coming undone. Now, after only 7 months of wear, the soles have cracked at the ball of the foot on both boots.We checked the Doc Martin website and they say that you have to contact your retailer for a return. There is no information on the Amazon website for arranging such a return. We're outside the return window, and if we return them anyway, according to the return policy, we pay shipping PLUS lose 15-50% of the purchase price as a restocking fee. Hardly worth the trouble. Very disappointed in this sale.",0
"JUNK! TERRIBLE, STUPID sequal: The original ""Jeepers creepers"" had one of the most exciting original openings of any recent horror film I had seen. The movie was innovative, original and very scary. This lame sequal is plain horrible. The opeining defines boredom and the film drags on and on and never even approaches the original film's genuine frightful feeling. The Creeper's freaky truck never makes an apperance, the sog that was tied nto he title and theme never is played and the Creeper siply flies around looking stupid and not scary. The entire movie revolves around a bunch of jocks on a bus, stranded on the road,which alone is beyond lame and boring. None of the characters are interesting, and I felt this was just a lame excuse for MGM to cash in on whatever money they coud gross off this as that studio has had very few hits recently. Don't waste your time with this mess like I did. On a scale of 1-10 I give this pile of junk a ZERO!",0
"Yes or No?? Definately NO ! ! !: I am reading this book as a textbook in my theology class. It's supposed to be a book for christians to stregthen their faith in Jesus. I believe that Jesus is our Savior and all, but this book definately makes me doubt. It constantly contradicts itself and is just a pain to read. It's supposed to be book a book that answers tough questions about christianity. It certainly asks tough questions like the one about whether or not Jesus' Ressurection really took place or not, but the thing is that it does NOT answer these tough questions. Chris, the Christian's response to the resurrection question is that the gospel writers are trustworthy people.. WHAT KIND OF ANSWER IS THAT?? I totally agree with Ant Phenom and WPhung on this. It is just a horrible book.",0
"Preaching to the Choir: This entire book can be summed up by a look at the index. There is an entry under ""death penalty -- arguments against"" but no entry under ""death penalty -- arguments for"". And there are arguments for it, no matter what Sister Prejean and other reviewers seem to believe...the issue isn't nearly as simple or one-sided as she would have you believe.",0
Very cynical: I was shocked to find this book sitting on the selves at my local bookstore the other day. The fact that someone would write a book about a situation that has even the remote possibility of not being true is beyond foolish.,0
"Nothing like what iowa's Cousin Rick Black Has!! Give us The Deer Burger Cookbook anytime!: Cut and Dry..

"Couldn't Be More Pleased--Price and Quality!: I bought this set last week and, of course, received it quickly with free shipping. I love the knives, which are really, really sharp and look great.

"Easily the best hip-hop record of the year.: Del (with help from the infallible Dan the Automator and Kid Koala) does it again and releases not only the best hip-hop record of the year, but one of the best records of the year PERIOD. This one is hard to compare to ""Both Sides of the Brain"" (which is also awesome) since the styles of the two are so different, but ""3030"" will definitely be of interest to fans of Del's previous records. Highest recommendation - If you don't like this one, you don't like hip-hop.",1

"An Eclectic Collection: Tracks from the Vault is a compilation of songs from other albums (mostly). While not their greatest songs, most of Tracks from the Vault's songs are pretty good, and (mostly) they're very different (as opposed to repetitively similar). A large portion of the songs are solely instrumental (Johnny's Wedding, Flower Among Them All, The Fairy King, The High Reel, King of the Fairies, Phil the Flutters Rag, The Fab Four - Four, and Oi Sins Tune) but that doesn't mean that they're not good! King of the Fairies and The High Reel are both especially good. Green Gravel is a cool folk-ish song, and Motorway Madness is a rockin' rock song. And dont even get me started in Dearg Doom, which is one of my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE songs.Best Songs:Dearg DoomKing of the FariesThe High Reel",1

That's all I can say about this movie in one word. I love this movie! This seriously is an amazing story, based on a freakin' true story might I add! Loved it! Had everything: children in their innocent youth, a young woman becoming a lady, a sad man who didn't know what he had, and to top it off, a war! For those who have never seen this movie before, I say to you: What the f--- are you waiting for? Seriously, this movie will move you, if not, become your top 10 movies of all time. Don't be ratchet!",1
"Misanthropic Safari: I read this book before a recent extensive trip to Kenya and Tanzania. I had never been to Africa before so the book, in large part, shaped my expectations of African people and society. I took it for granted that I would be robbed, maybe even as soon as I arrived at the airport. I even went so far as to wear ragged clothing and carry a cheap bag, in order not to make myself a target. Now that I have returned from my trip, I wonder whether the author and I visited the same continent. The people I met were warm and friendly. I never felt threatened and, to my surprise, was never robbed. Now I see that the author had an overly negative point of view regarding Africa, especially Kenya. I suppose every society has its good and bad sides. Unfortunately, the author focused all of his attention on the bad and ignored all that is good about Africa. This is probably a reflection of him and his own pitiful view of life and people, than an accurate depiction of the continent.",0

"Great product, slimy company: My feet would much rather belong to a very tiny person, so I need arch support. I ordered the WalkFits and find them to be just fantastic underneath a nice neoprene Spenco insole, but the company is a real horror show. Communication is nonexistent, and for what they charge for shipping and handling I half expected them to arrive the next day in a wooden crate- nope, it took weeks, and they came in an envelope in the mail. What was the other $6 for, I'm wondering?I'm very happy to see that I can get these at Target and CVS. I could use another pair or two but don't ever want to deal directly with the company again. There are too many legitimate, reasonable businesses out there.",1

I describe the book and say what I about it.: This book was AWSOME!!! I felt sorry for the mother of the two boys. She had to go through so much having her husband get sick then losing her son to find out he was kidnapped by a maniac.The kidnapper was really creepy and crazy. He shot a guard to escape from prison and even threatened his own sister for money. He kidnapped the boy for a hostage and almost killed him. Well I don't want ruin it by saying any more just that I really recommend SILENT NIGHT. Mary Higgins Clark did a spectacular job! It's very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

"Buyers Beware! DON'T BUY ANYTHING COBY: I got this in Oct, in less than 10 minutes, it died. I called Coby, they said ship it back, they would inspect it and replace or repair it. The process would take about 3-4 weeks. 8 weeks later, they now say it is backordered 2 more weeks. When asked about a refund, they said it would take 6-8 weeks! Get something from a company that stands behind their product. Coby obviously doesn't care about quality or customer service by their actions.UPDATED REVIEW:THREE months have gone by, no replacement, no refund, no calls being returned. If I could rate them a ZERO, I would! Don't buy a Coby product, you will be VERY SORRY that you did!",0
"5 stars for the Best Reggae Album ever!: The winning formula: Lee Scratch's soft dub touch + Cedric Mynton's very unique falsetto (especially for reggae)+ some very heartfelt texts = the best reggae album I have ever heard. This is the real thing; the pure stuff. An absolute must for any listener of reggae, but everyone should hear this uplifting music. Very spiritual. You'll see....",1

"Where's the sountrack?: Whatever happened to the kickass sountrack? Not the score, but the album that had Vinnie Vincent Invasion, Divinyls and Blondie among others? For such a suckie movie, the soundtrack was pretty cool. Where is it? I only have a copy on vinyl.",0
"Far too many editing issues: It's hard to take seriously or have any confidence in a book that contains so many spelling and content errors. For example, when describing the scientific method, the text lists four steps that don't match the key terms/glossary box on the same page. The first word after the first bullet on the first page is also spelled incorrectly. I could go on, but...very shoddy. Fortunately, I only rented the book and didn't have to pay full price at the college I attend.",0
very practical and helpful book: I ran into this book years ago when it was first published. It is very helpful for dealing with difficult relationships and learning how to grow out of dependency in relationships. Very readable easy to apply. If you find yourself being trampled on by others and feeling angry because you feel like others use you then this book is for you. I learned the importance of two letters by reading this book and I am happier for it. N - O. My wife and I like the book so much that we buy copies of it to give away to those who are struggling with relationship in this way. It is definitly worth having in anyones library.,1
"Short, effective review: This is a good, short book that will leave the reader satisfied, but also wanting some more. Short books often have the merit of being concise and accessible, but often not having the full details one would wish for. In a small space, David Holmes makes a convincing case that the Founding Fathers were in fact mostly Deists who were friendly to Christianity, but favored reason and abstract moral principle above miracles and metaphysical beliefs. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Founding Fathers or the guiding religious principles that drove them. Holmes book will illuminate much, but the curious reader will go further.",1

Samsung LCD TV LN-R328W - more a PC monitor than TV: I was impressed by picture quality on that TV and by great integration capabilities (input ports). I had it for 2 months and I started to notice dark spots on the LCD panel. I made about 20 calls to attempt fixing it under warranty just to hear them blame it on me or shipping for the physical damage. I used to be a big fan of Samsung but their products just need to be more reliable - I also had trouble with a Samsung washer not so long ago. Also pay attention to low quality of plastics used - the TV is very shaky on the provided stand - I would recommend a wall mount. Sound quality is so bad I would call this model a monitor. In fact it does look like a big PC monitor and not like a TV set. Nice speaker set is a must even for occasional music listeners as me.My rating is 2 just because it has picture quality I loved so much. Otherwise it is a worst buy I've ever made.,0
"A worth buy book: This book is an excellent book in interfacial instability. The problems presented are not new but they are still of great interest. The essays, i.e. the chapters, contain good explanations for some great works done by Lord Rayleigh,Chandrasekhar and others. This book is very useful for graduate students. It is worth the price.",1
"Do not order from 'Home and Beyond': Home and Beyond was back-ordered but listed it as ""in stock."" When the torch failed to arrive, I emailed them three times and heard nothing. Then I called and was told it would be at least another week before they restocked and could not guarantee a delivery date.",0
"Calamity Jane: My movie does not play because apparently it's a Region 2 PAL disc. Am I the only one in the world that didn't know what that means? For others who may be as technologically ignorant as I am, it means it's intended for use in Japan, Europe, South Africa and the Middle East, including Egypt. Region 1 NTSC is intended for use in the USA and Canada. It would be helpful if this was explained somewhere on the order page.",0

"Too small: I couldn't fit very many of my milk bags in it. Also, please note they must be flat or this doesn't work well. I took another reviewer's suggestion and just use ziplocs, now.",0
"Fits stove knobs perfect, easy to use: It seems like baby-proofing a home requires spending a huge amount of money on horribly cheap items that often don't work.These stove knob covers are the exception-- they are inexpensive, fit perfectly, a breeze to install, and do exactly what they intend. We recently moved to a home with a gas stove and our little one became obsessed with those loud, clicky stove knobs. These covers were the perfect solution for us and work very well.",1
"Logitech Attack 3 Joystick - highly limited: Disappointing, purchased because it has a USB interface and thought would be a nice update for my MS flight simulators.pros: Nice and compact, and good feel for up/down (pitch), roll right/left (banking), but ...Cons: NO left/right (yaw) Rudder capability! If you intend to use this for flight sims, and anything requiring some thinking and manuevering, this will also disappoint you.No driver CD, instead you are instructed to go to LogiTech.Com. But once there, the only thing you can download is some gaming software. Their menuing system had difficulty indentifying the joystick, in spite of being provided product names and/or model numbers as instructed.The controller says it has 11 programmable buttons, but I find no way of assigning any functions to any buttons using my MS simulators.Look elsewhere if you're searching for a 3-axis joystick.",0
"HD Radio easy to use: This Sangean HD tuner came as advertised. Easy to hook up to existing system and simple enough to use. As with all tuners, the reception is limited by where the antennae are placed - reception never seems to be where we house our stereo - but on a good day, with the right station, it's a beautiful thing.",1
"Unfinished product.: Be advised, this game is extremely crash prone and suffers from some extremely frustrating bugs - like character loss! The company admits to issues, and claims to be trying to fix them, but thus far they've done nothing.To top it off, there are big balance issues later in the game that clearly show the game was not fully play tested. Once again the developer claims to be working to address these issues - yet we see no patches to address them.The final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is short, expect only 3 hours to finish the main quest on normal, then you have to repeat the SAME GAME 2 more times to unlock all difficulty levels.What a stinker of a game.",0
"Smaller than I expected: It is way smaller than I expected but is still very cute especially for gnome ""collectors"".",1
"What was it all about?: I kept waiting to find out what the horrible secret in Cate's past was to cause her bizarre behavior. The ending - although a surprise - came at you way too fast - and rather like someone who said ""okay I think I'll choose so and so as the culprit."" The romance aspect had teenager written all over it - both with Cate and her friend. And the overall end - give me a break - that doesn't happen in ""real"" life. There really was no ""mystery"" in the real sense - you felt the murder was just a secondary consideration.What a waste of time! I could have used the time I wasted on reading the book to do something really productive - like watch my grass grow!",0
"A Fast Paced Delight!!!!: ""The Last Viking"" is seriously charming. The story is silly and sexy ;it captures you immediately. The characters Rolf and ""Merry-Death"" were so endearing!!! It was such fun to witness Rolf's fascination over all of the modern inventions that he came across.....This is my first book by Sandra Hill..I'm so excited to have discovered her and I can't wait to read more of her stories. Don't deny yourself the pleasure!!! Read this book!!!!",1
"This game is very entertaining, and fun!: Battle Tanx is a shoot-em-up game where you just battle against other teams, a tank that is trying to destroy your convoy, auto-gun turrits, or more. You have your own tank, that is designed depending of which team you choose. You can also pick up things like helth, ammo, other ammo, and shields. There are some choices like convoy, battlelord, tank wars, and more. You also select where your battle will take place. This is a VERY great, fun, worth big bucks, and good game. BUT, this games is not for kids 8 and under.",1
"Not what I expected!: I'm a senior in high school and have just read Zlata's diary for our historical literature class. Truthfully, I was somewhat let down by the book. It seemed as though with the announcement of her diary's publication, the entries changed from introspective to writing for an audience. Whereas Anne Frank was purely writing for herself, Zlata knew that her diary would be published, making it less impacting on my emotions. Granted, I could never comprehend what she had to go through and I feel for her, her family, and the lost innocence of her childhood. I recommend this book with some reservations.",0
"A Book I Wish I Had Written: I have been intrigued with number bases ever since I learned about them in 6th grade. It gave me an entirely different and deeper understanding of our base 10 system and set my brain up for understanding the binary system of computers later on. I have been toying with ways to teach students about this concept ever since and this was also one of my ideas. In fact, I have collected rubber alien figures with differing numbers of fingers so I can use them as manipulative examples of how and why other number bases would work.The only thing I do differently is place less emphasis on the binary system, until students understand a higher base. But I have seen others teach binary first and other bases later and that has worked for them, too.OK, this book is not for everyone, but I do think it is a cute and interesting introduction to other number bases and, for students for whom concepts like this are actually fun and exciting, it is definitely worthwhile.",1
"Cotton Candy Maker a Hit!: The cotton candy maker was a hit for my 4-year-old who loves cotton candy (but rarely gets it!). It's easy to use and the kids (and adults, too) really like the taste. It's good to know you can use granulated sugar and pre-sweetened Kool-aid mix to use once you run out of the packet of sugar. Although we only received one packet where I thought we'd get 2, that single packet will last a long time. The AC cord is a little short (we place the the candy maker on a lower table to help my daughter gather her own cotton candy) but overall, it was a great purchase. Definitely have parent supervision as the plate that spins the cotton candy gets very hot as stated in the manual.",1

"Lowen and Navarro at their best: L&N combine terrific harmonies with an accoustical backdrop. The quality of the album demonstrates their strength as musicians and singers, capture the qualities of a live show with nearly the production values of a studio recording. Their music touches the heart and appeals to people young and old.",1
"Wonderful Book Packed With Useful Info: I've seen Dr. Colbert speak on ""This Is Your Day"" with Benny Hinn. His book is just as great as his talks. He is a medical doctor who uses a holistic approach to health mainly in a proactive and preventitive way. This book is easy and fast reading. It is jam packed with useful information on what everyday things we can avoid for better health. It includes information on detoxifying the body and gives people a ""heads up"" on harmful things that we come into contact with everyday that we don't think even twice about. It is a great book and I highly recommend it for people to see what things they are really exposing themselves to every day and what you can do live a healthier life.",1
"Disappointed: Was not a fan of this book for a few reasons. First~ The story line. I kinda had to start skipping pages because it just got to boring. Second~ While I did like Rafe(he is what made me finish this book), I could not stand Kerry(she was just dumb and whiny). Third~ The price is rediculous($12.99)?! Fourth~ This is just a personal preference, but why are the covers on the kindle books for this series so ugly and the paperbacks are beautiful?",0
"Transcendence: Vaughan Penn is the most gifted singer-song writer I have encountered in years. Her voice is incredible, the perfect blend for the music she has written, and her lyrics are both personal and profound. After I got my first Vaughan Penn CD, I immediately bought the other three. Of her four remarkable discs, my very favorite is whichever one I am playing at the time. She probes rich Spiritual Truth and everyday personal life events in clear, common language. The variations she establishes with her voice and the musical layers she puts down on each track means that her music never seems to get old, even with repeated listening. My humble opinion is the Vaughan is one of the best things that has happened to music since rock 'n' roll.",1
"This movie is not as advertised!: This is supposed to be a fun, qwirky, cute childrens movie, but it's anything but! After just under halfway through this movie, my child was horrified and I took it out. It's like someone got drunk and thought it might be cute to make an animated version of",0
"For completists only: Some interesting facts tossed ala salad with other excerpts and interviews. I learned a little of Oldham's personality and thoughts, but history is far more interesting in many other books. You won't waste your time with this book, but it probably won't excite you much. Not much else to say.",0
"~ buyer beware ~ Just for show item ~: This is a "" only for looks "" item. It is not very warm. I put this as a decorative piece over my feather blanket. It does have some discoloration. It looks like it has sat in the sun for a while. The upc regular price is $99.99 not $150.00 as stated. It does come with flyaways that need to be trimmed. Do not pull them the material on top is nice loking but will tear or fray if pulled. I doubt this will make it out of the washer...Much less the dryer. Becareful with the bed skirt it is so thin it needs to be placed in place do not pull it or you will tear it in half. Also you will need to order the next size or bigger. The Californis King I ordered barely fits over the top of my full size bed. This is not children friendly. It is a nice to look at set but needs to be handled with care. The pillow shams are nice.",0
"Not the Govenor of CA: This is not the movie! There is a certain frown or laugh I get from people when I mention Conan books. They relate everything to the movie, not having a clue of the magnitude of these stories. See for yourself and you won't be dissapointed. Gore, guts, and beautiful women. Oh yeah, and a heck of a great story teller. Pure fantasy! Enjoy it for yourself.",1
"Good even handed skim through several centuries: I was surprised to read the 1 star reviews.Obviously they have neither read nor studied from this text.I have used this text for two successive 7th graders. We all found it very readable, interesting and fair.There is nothing about converting to Islam, Buddhism, Christianity or any other religion. The religious information is taught as part of understanding of the history of a particular time.Also this is a middle school text and only refers to historically important aspects. So obviously neither the number of Muhammad's wives (one of the complaints) nor the number of slaves owned by George Washington were included (arguably more historically relevant).If you truly want to know a little about World History, this is a good place to start.",1
"sound quality of mp3 download is poor: I agree with all other reviews to date regarding the quality of the music itself, but be aware that the sound quality of the MP3s are poor. The machine that ripped them must have been under stress at the time as there are numerous skips and dropouts throughout the album. Listen to the audio samples. The imperfections are representative of the entire recording. I personally find it quite distracting.It looks like the album is now out of print. I would recommend trying to get your hands on a used physical CD.",0
"The authority on courtyard housing, then and now.: Not only are California's courtyard neighborhoods thoroughly documented, but Polyzoides et al thoroughly explain this housing typology, its evolution, and its finer points.Whether you have a casual interest in California history, or a need for deep professional understanding of the architecture, I think you will be delighted by this book.I should also mention that Stefanos Polyzoides, one of the authors, has a firm in Pasadena which has recently produced some exceptional courtyard buildings to add to this lineage. (Seven Fountains, in Hollywood, and Mission Meridian in South Pasadena)",1
"Great fitness book!: I bought this book a few weeks ago, read through it, started the workouts and it's pretty solid. If you want to obtain an exceptional fitness level, buy the book and DO the workouts. There a are a variety of different workouts involving running, biking, bodyweight exercises, weights, agility training, etc. You definately won't be bored! Why 4 stars and not 5? The only issue I have so far is that a few of the exercises in the workouts are not in the exercise descriptions. But, if you have any sort of background at all, you'd know what they are, and if not, do a web search. I'm sure they'll correct that in the reprint. Overall, great book!",1

"Good Value: I purchace this radio to replace an old worn out Sony headset. For the price the radio does what is expected. The lower price of AA batteries compared to AAA would make it a better unit if it ran on AA. My experience with Amazon.com has been excellent. Be sure to compare prices from outside sources. Do not rely on % discount off Retail, no one ever paid those origional prices after 60 days of the product introduction.",1
"Too Crude? Too Mean-Spirited? Too Bad!: At long last, someone got the guts to kick some sand in the face of the lying conservative bullies! Al Franken is a national treasure and I'm thrilled by the success of this book.As someone who actually reads the newspapers and watches the news, I've known for a long time that the ""liberal media"" was nothing more than an invention of the radical right, but I'm thrilled to see a #1 bestselling book finally knock it down for good. Anybody who can read the chapters on the outrageous way that Al Gore's campaign and Paul Wellstone's memorial were covered in the press and still think the media is controlled by liberals is truly beyond help.You keep giving them hell, Al. This proud liberal is sick and tired of being called anti-American and blamed for 9/11 and every other ill that's ever befallen this country. Finally, someone tells it like it is. Thanks, Bill O'Reilly, for being such a thin-skinned little wimp and bringing this book lots of extra publicity.",1
"If you want flowers, ask a florist: Nashville Skyline is straightforward, easy-rolling, upbeat country guitar. It could have been enjoyable, but unfortunately it comes from a genius in introspective, turbulent, political and emotional statements.

"Sadly Disappointing..........: I enjoyed Chocolat and Blackberry Wine so much, I couldn't wait for the paperback of Five Quarters of the Orange to come out in June, so I went to the UK site and ordered it. I couldn't wait to receive it and get started. Sadly, I was disappointed. There really were no characters in this novel you really ""cared"" about. I found myself admiring 9 year old Framboise' grit, but just didn't ""care"" for her much. France itself seemed such a vital part of the novels, Chocolat and Blackberry Wine, yet this novel lacked the charm which appealed to me in those novels. I also bought Coastliners at the same time I ordered this one and I'm actually filled with more trepidation than excitement to begin reading it. I still enjoy Joanne Harris, and will continue to read her novels, but this was just not one I would recommend to my friends or choose to read again.",0
"Pittsburgh Steel Industry and Union Formation: This is a very good near source material for the Steel Industry in Pittsburgh, the abuse of the workers and including the horrendous working conditions at that time. It is graphic and shows the collusion of the state with the corporation which the workers had to contend at that time. It is a very good read to understand the motiviation for Unions in this country in general and in the steel industry in particular.",1
"Excellent wrap-up: I've thoroughly enjoyed reading the trilogy and thought the first 2 adaptations into movies were great. This one is just as good. In the third book, there was A LOT of detail on the secret society and its players. Some people really like that, but I thought it dragged the story and the action did not pick up until about 70% into the book. This movie, thank goodness, deftly left out those details without getting us lost. I also appreciated that they left out the majority of Erika Berger's story. In doing this, the movie moved at an excellent pace.I've said it in my other reviews of the first two movies, but I cannot emphasize enough about Noomi Rapace's depiction of Salander. She makes the films!!",1
"WHAT?: The songs in the movie is super great, but the soundtrack.. what happened?? Where are the songs sung by Kelly Preston? The producers made a mistake when leaving those out.",0
Tully... An exploration of life: This book is the best I've ever read. The life of Tully and the troubles she went through shows the stregnth a woman can have. She lost a lot but still was able to survive and make a life that she could claim as her own. I would recommend this book to any budding psychologist or to any woman who thinks their life is tough,1

"HANDS DOWN THE BEST EARPHONES I HAVE EVER OWNED: I am so impressed with these earphones!!! The Quality, the Sound, the Comfort, the Price!! I read the reviews and thought I will give it a try for a few bucks more than the other set. I am so HAPPY with these earphones!! Its just so much MORE than I thought they would be!! The comfort wow- its like you wearing nothing at all, and the sound is in incredible!!! THANK YOU for Making these!!! Thank for the people that gave the positive Feedback, that help me decide to order them! :)",1
"References other commentators too much: This book has good information however the arthur referrences other commentators too much which is a destraction for the reader from the main points of the book. Also, this book needs to be more simplified...enough that even a 10 year old can understand it as a new Christian.",0
"Great substitute for sugar: Splenda is a great sugar substitute. The taste provides nice sweetening. Better than Sweet n' Low, for example.It is used just as sugar is, so one can easily (without any measurement problems) use this in recipes instead of sugar.Enough in the package to last quite a while!",1
Best non-stick skillet ever!: I am so glad I got this non-stick skillet. There were other T-Fal skillets in Target that were obviously not the same quality as this one. I am so glad I read the reviews and did not settle for anything less. I am completely satisfied. One morning my husband made scrambled eggs and we forgot to clean the skillet until the next morning. I put it under water and it just wiped clean. Awesome--no sticking at all even overnight! I haven't used it in the oven yet so I can't comment on it's performance there. I use it nearly every day and it is the best non-stick skillet I have ever had.,1

"Great little camera with solid image quality.: I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my mother. My mother was never really into taking pictures, but when I loaned her one of my digital cameras for a trip, she ended up taking quite a few pictures and enjoying it. I thought this would be a nice gift, and I was right. She loved that it is so small and easy to take with her.Build quality is generally good, though the battery door is very flimsy feeling, and the tripod mount is plastic. The lens is average in aperture and range, but of good quality. The pictures turned out nicely, although you will have to deal with an occasional blurry corner. It's also very easy to use, with a great screen.I would have liked it better if it had an image stabilizer, but you can't have it all, and at the price, it's a trade-off you have to make. My mother will not miss it, as I'm sure she has no idea what it is anyhow.",1
"A Landmark Collection: ""The Man I Might Become"" is a landmark collection that shows a welcome maturation of the gay community - an acknowledgement that to understand and accept the self, we must understand and forgive others. And for many gay men, there is no figure more ""other"" than one's own father. Yet, as the title suggests, coming to terms with one's father is also a way to truly see oneself. The best essays in the book (notably those of Joseph Hansen and Bernard Cooper) are superbly written evocations of the knot of father-son love, scary and deep with feeling.",1
Don't waste your money: The only redeeming thing about this product is its comfortable handle. We bought nylon since our last metal masher had to be tossed due to rusting. We spend more time getting the potato out of the narrow masher segments than we spend mashing. It is very frustrating. Stick with the wider segments. We have since replaced it with another metal one with wider spaces - an Oxo one with a comfortable handle. I will give 5 stars to Oxo's customer service. I contacted them about my disappointment and they are giving me a replacement product of equal value.,0
"Sam's Sandwich: This is a GREAT read aloud story for elementary age kids. It teaches rhyming, prediction, advanced vocabulary, etc... I attended a Readers Workshop for struggling readers a couple years ago and they showed us how to shred some paper in your hands before you read the story and at the end, after you've ""unfolded"" the story, pretend to take a bite. After a few chews, cough into your hand blowing shredded paper all over the kids. I wasn't sure how that would go over on a live audience so I tried it out on my son's 4th grade class... They LOVED it and asked me to do it again! I ordered this book to present to the teacher and class ~ the kids will be able to take it home and share it with their families. Thumbs up!",1

Don't waste your money: Got this movie to try out a new 120hz lcd tv. It did show things in 3d but even worse than in the 50's when 3d movies on the screen first came out and they were bad. Go for one of the new 240 - 600hz led tv's that are out now. You need the much higher refresh rate of the scanning to really experience the 3d effect. Those tw's also come with advanced optics (glasses) that enhance the experience.,0

Cloverfield: Its a great monster movie for the times we live in since we dont see that many monster movies out anymore. Other than the camera angle its worth buying it.,1
"Bait & Switch: I specifically ordered the ""Excalibur Forever Flashlight"" from Instapark, because my research indicated that the no-name Chinese copycat versions of this flashlight were cheaply made garbage. I could have paid 1/2 the price from other vendors for the knock-offs, but I wanted a better quality product, so I paid more to Instapark. Well, when the 2 flashlights arrived, they were both the Chinese knock-offs; in fact, 1 of them was obviously previously opened and returned. I have called Instapark and am awaiting a return call, we will see if they make this right. However, if they do not have the product they advertise, they MUST advise you and allow you to cancel your order (not only because it is the right thing to do, but also to do otherwise is CONSUMER FRAUD in violation of federal law! Imagine paying for a new Porsche and receiving a Hyundai. This is no different.",0
"Scratchy velcro side touches skin: I do not have a large hand or wrist, but the medium size does not close completely and so the scratchy velcro side touches my skin. The wrist support I have for my other hand has an inner cloth sleeve, a better system of thin and wide velcro strips that go through buckles instead of the 4 bare straps here, and better materials. If you really want this I suggest you overestimate your hand size and not expect a quality product.",0
"Most movies no match for Three on a Match: Three on a match is truly a great movie. With stars like Bette Davis, Joan Blondell, Ann Dvorak and Humphrey Bogart what else would you have. The story is of three school girls and what path their lives take. The one who has it all is the most unfulfilled of the three. She gets involved with gangsters and ends up making the ultimate sacrifice. Don't miss this one!",1
Spanish: I just received the book and have only looked at the first two chapters. It seems like a good book and approach to learning a language. The book focuses on what is most likely needed information when first enter a Spanish speaking country. I would recommend the book.,1
"Devastating and Moving: I can't add anything new to the much-deserved praise you'll see in other reviews; this book is one of the best I've read in a long time, perhaps ever.I read it in one sitting and cried--SOBBED--at the end. How many books can move you that quickly and that deeply?",1
"Baby Boomers Not Ready: This book was dedicated to Baby Boomers. I don't think that they are ready yet to acknowledge that they are approaching the age of 60, much less think about their mortality. Census numbers reveal that 6,000,000 Baby Boomers are already dead. They are not ready for this fact. This was an excellent book, but it has not opened up the conversation that it should have stimulated. [...]",1
"Baby loves the warm wipes: This item is definitely not a necessity, but baby sure loves the comfort of warm wipes. However, there are a few downsides to this product. The instructions say to replace the ever-fresh pillow every 3 months and to re-wet the pillow every 1 week. I found that it dried out and browned unless you wet it every 3-4 days and the pillow only lasted about 2 months. Also, I only place about 1/3 of the package of wipes in the warmer and put the rest in a ziploc. The plain white wipes warmer also looks nicer in the nursery than the plastic wipes tub.",1
"Wonderful album: I would give it 6 stars - exceptional work, my vote for best album of 2004. Anja's introspective, dreamy voice draws you in to the music - resistance is futile. Blind My Mind is one of the best songs I have ever heard, period - Flunk absolutely nailed that one. There are many other outstanding songs on the album (e.g. Play, Morning Star, Balcony, and Skysong), and not a weak song in the bunch.For those who were hoping for a repeat of Sleepyhead, my advice would be to approach this album on its own merits, otherwise you risk missing out on a gem of an album.Flunk, if you read these messages, please come and play in San Francisco some day, maybe at a club like Bimbo's - you have many fans here! And I hope you are getting the recognition you deserve.",1
"Completely worthless -leaks everywhere!: I just bougt one of these despite the price tag because it advertised itself as being absolutely leak proof. The very first time I used it, it started leaking out both ends, dripping urine all over my white carpet. Needless to say this item is going straight back to Amazon. I just wish I could now bill them for having the carpet steam cleaned. My suggestion is steer well clear of this thing. The fittings don't seal correctly and clearly there are some manufacturing problems. I will be buying the $5 urinals instead that have caps that don't leak. What a piece of junk!",0
"A Rather Different Henty: This particular Henty is rather different from most. Your ordinary Henty is an action/adventure story, and begins with a boy who, while mischievous, is almost supernaturally 'good' in other ways. He gets in trouble in home and is forced out into the world, where he does good and very well, thank you.A Girl of the Commune, on the other hand, begins with a boy who is, in a word, lazy. And the action/adventure features, while present, are subsummed under the romance and character development bits. Oh, and the book is a mystery. Not so much for the reader, but for the characters.Altogether a good, if different, Henty.",1
"Dont buy: Everything that happened to other people happened to me. I have an Ibook, used the lock for about two months total. I bought it last year and used it for the month of October before I started to just lock my office. During that month I never set the lock to any combo. It remained at the 0-0-0-0. I used it for one month this year and it is already broken. I was having trouble with it for about two weeks before it final broke. That brings by total time used to six weeks of normal use.

"The Reluctant Widow: Poor editing has ruined what would otherwise have been a good story. There was hardly one page without a distracting spelling error.

"Life is full of gray areas: Meryl Streep portrays an inflexible nun, dedicated to the job of keeping things the way they've always been, and staying fully in charge of the school and convent which she leads. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a priest with great compassion for his parishioners, and especially for a young altar boy whose father beats him on a regular basis. Streep's character chooses this very compassion to challenge the priest and, using an incident reported by another nun, she works to discredit him and banish him from the parish. Streep and Hoffman are wonderful actors and without their performances this would have been a much less powerful movie. My husband and I had diametrically opposed views of what the truth was in the gray areas of the film, which says to me that it was a wonderful springboard for discussion. I did feel that it was a little slow at times and that there should have been more proof for Streep's character to act as she did.",1
Tipped the scale: My 2 1/2 year old son had the potty basics down. Pee-pee was pretty easy but he WOULD NOT do #2 in the potty. I ordered the video and he loved it! I saw a definate change in his potty habits within 2 days (watching 2-3 times a day). After 2-3 weeks he was using the potty without my wife or I asking him. Even if it only knocks a month off of the childs learning curve you are going to save money on diapers :-),1
"It is a good source to help get ready for the cot test: Even though this is a good source to help you get ready for the cot test, it is not enough. Don't rely only in this book if you want to pass the test.",1
"The Big Four: I read The Big Four by Agatha Christie for school and was amazed to learn what a great book it was. I have read many other books by Ahatha Christie, but none of them even compare to this one. This book was a great read because it was action packed with many surprising revelations.The themes of this book would generally be to never jump to conclusions and never give up. These themes are clearly exposed throughout the book and make it even more meaningful for the reader. The age level i would recommend ranges from young adults, beginning at 12 because of difficult words and mild violence, to adults of all ages. I recommend this book to anyone in that age group who wants to read a great mystery.",1
"Good book for Balkan studies: This is a good reading material, recommended for those who are doing research related to Balkan's history.While you may want to get this book in a printed format, it is freely available as a PDF, simple googling will help to find it. As it was written in 19th century, I am not quire sure what ""copyright"" is Amazon referring to in the preview section. (Correction: on Google Books you can't find vol 1, they scanned only vol 2, which covers Bosnia,Dalmatia,Montenegro)",1
"Photographic Loser: I generally don't write reviews unless my experience is very good, or very bad. In this case, it was very bad. The quality of a printed photograph is horrible. I tried it both from a Win XP machine and my MacBook running OS X. In both cases...bad bad bad. Maybe I got a lemon? I'm tossing it into the garbage and buying an HP. There is no reason to keep a bad printer since they are virtually free with the initial supply of ink.",0
"Excellent book: I use this book continually, and suggest it for anyone who loves essential oils and wants to learn more. It is well organized and written in a lovely voice. The information is accurate and extremely helpful.",1
"Wonderful movie.. poor DVD: This is a terrific movie - well deserving of five stars! I really enjoyed watching it and cried a few times. I was just frustrated that it was a Pan & Scan instead of the original widescreen, meaning you lose a good portion of the picture, which took away from the experience. I was aware of this before purchasing and bought it anyway because it seemed to be the only way to get the movie. However, I certainly didn't buy an HDTV just to have the sides of my movies chopped off and stare at black lines. When will the era of Pan & Scan come to and end? Not soon enough for me....",1
"Great paintball game: This game is truly a lot of fun.I used to have a paintball game for windows 98 that was a better game, but this game is good for a paintball game. It's just like being in a paintball tournament.Buyers beware of your sellers, I bought this game and it was guareenteed to work, and it worked fine the first time, the second time it started lagging, and I tried it a third time and it wouldn't get past loading screen. I hadn't taken it out of my ps2 and I explained the situation to the seller and they told me that since it had worked the first time I must have caused the problem. So just beware of the sellers, even if the game is tagged great condition or like new.",1
"Biased, Driven By a Pro-Homosexual Agenda: This film gives a very biased point of view. Scripture was taken out of it's biblical context, and any scripture that refuted the film's objectives were ignored, including the many that call sex outside of marriage a sin.If you're looking for an honest, fair and balanced documentary, don't waste your time.",0
Rock Solid Router: Configure it and forget it. This little baby just keeps working. Add an external high gain antenna and you can cover your entire house.,1
"If you are a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse fan you'll love it!: My son's favorite show has been Mickey Mouse Clubhouse since he was about 18 months old, he is now 4 and still loves it. So when I heard about this movie I really wanted to get it for him. He will not sit through any movie, but he will watch this over and over again. Sometimes back to back! I am not a huge TV fan for kids, but this is educational and fun so it is great for every once in a while. My son loves it and I am happy with it too.",1
"Do not buy this printer!: I have been a loyal Epson ink jet user for many years. In addition to the C84, we currently operate a C42 and a photo stylus 2200. All 3 printers are used heavily for various job types. Only the C84 is problematic. Two weeks ago, the printer stopped printing black. Thinking it was out of ink, I replaced the cartridge ($). This did not fix the issue, so I called Epson, who charged me to talk to them ($$). I was advised to run several print head cleanings, and to shut the printer off overnight. Still no fix. I was then advised to drop the printer off to a ""local"" tech, who charged me $45 just to do a diagnostic ($$$). After a week in the shop, I was told the print head is damaged, and that it will be cheaper to buy a new printer than to repair this one ($$$$). I will replace this printer - you can be sure it won't be with an Epson.",0
Pnoney Baloney: Listen carefully to the tracks. They are cover bands copying the original music. When is Amazon going to get wise and get rid of this kind of junk that wastes our time?,0
"Probably the best legal thriller writer: He is probably the best, not for writing a suspenseful book, but because he has an amazing gift for words and it is very difficult to predict in which way his books will go. Grisham may provide a faster read, but you do not get as much out of it. However, Burden of Proof is not as good as Presumed Innocent because it takes a while to build momentum and the details of Dixon's business become a little stifling.",1
"I can see her in her voice!: Once you have seen Kristen Chenoweth in action (check out YouTube) you know not only what an extremely talented musician she is, but also how fabulous she is at acting out and conveying each piece to an audience. She is the WHOLE package! This CD is a great sampling of her extreme talents!",1
"Moulin Rouge!: I LOVE this movie!! Ewan McGregor is a great actor and Nicole Kidman is a great actress!! This movie illustrates Truth, beauty, freedom, and above all things, love. I recomend this movie to everyone cause it is sooo great!!!",1
"Not 8 gauge by any stretch, Not Worth 5 Bucks.: I think that they should take the 8 gauge off the ad because it is certainly not. I did not expect much quality for the price but it is not even as they describe and it will only hurt the performance of your amp and system. Pay a little more and get a quality kit. The right wires and fuses will make a world of difference. You get what you pay for and in this case nothing.",0
"Lousy product!: Bought these thinking they were a steal, but was very disappointed when I first tried them out. I bought these for one reason and one reason only: To be able to charge my iPod using a wall outlet. And guess what: Wall charger DID NOT work.Don't bother buying this product. Waste of money and time.",0
Music Stand: Ordered this for my son who plays the trumpet in school band. Very sturdy and nice wide ledge to place music on. Music won't fall off. Highly recommend.,1
"Great deal on great shoes!: Brooks Women's Vapor Running shoes are wonderful. I got a fantastic deal on Amazon. I am so glad my friend e-mail me about them. I workout in them every day. They are very comfortable, just the right amount of support. Love them!",1
Return costs are more than my order.: The overall process of recieving the item was good. However I recieved the same item for a gift and wanted to return my item only to find out the return address is in Great Britian. The return costs would have been more than the item purchased. If I had known the return address was out of the country I would not have purchased from this perticular vender.,0
"Best Show EVER!: When I found out that they made a series about King Henry VIII I was like I have to watch this now! I agree with some of the others post, do not rely on this series for a lot of in depth history. Don't get me wrong there are some very powerful political history points in this series but the episodes are just not long enough to cover all of the historial points that were happening then. Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a great king! I own the first and second season, about to order the third and watching the final! Definately a great series!",1
"Very interesting: This is a very interesting and engrossing book. It answers a lot of questions as to who Benedict Arnold was, what was his background, and most importantly: what compelled his treason.",1
"The Best: This is without a doubt their best!! Stipped Raped And Strangeled is one of the best songs i've heard by Cannibal Corpes and i have all their albums. F*cked with a Knife is awesome. All the songs are good but the standouts are: F*cked With A Knife, Stripped Raped And Strangeled, Pulverized, The Pick Axe Muders, And Bleeding. To bad this was the last of Chris Barnes with CC, I think he does better in SFU and George does better in CC. This is the best.",1
"cheaply built and no repair parts available: This toy is great fun, but is so cheaply built, and poorly engineered that the wheels fall off with little provocation rendering it useless. The axle connector on the left side wheels are soft and crack with just a little normal play. My son was very dissapointed, as was I ($20 down the drain) and contacting the manufacturer proved fruitless.We actually got two of these trucks (GraveDigger and Superman) and BOTH are now broken. The toy was hardly used, but the weak/soft plastic did it in.",0
"Transcendant: Definitely Maybe ranks alongside Sgt. Pepper (concept), Murmur (College radio / alternative), Nevermind (grunge), Too Far to Care (alt country) as truly seminal works of rock and roll. This album single handedly resurrected Brit-pop and stimulated interest in a genre that was in dire need of a jolt of energy.In terms of debut, almost nothing compares to the end to end brilliance of Definitely Maybe. Amazing lyrics, otherworldly guitar by Noel, and the best chops in rock by Liam, culimating with the incredible ""Slide Away"".If you only own 10 CD's, this is a must.",1
"Registry Mechanic is bad/deceptive-doesn't rid all/auto-renew,,,: I am a software tech. I first ""free trial"" V6 online-1. Finds 131 errors, but will only fix 4 (must buy full version!). SHEESH!2.

"No photos: This cookbook is one of those books that whatever you have left over in the fridge, you can dump it into a casserole. I'm not impressed!",0
"My favorite book ever!: At the age of 14, I first read this intriguing story back in 1978, right after it was published. I've read it more than 100 times, going through 4 copies. I even took a pilgrimage to the small mountain town of Nederland to see some of the places mentioned in the book. It is an excellent read. It is a wonderful trip back in time, not only to our disco era of 1978, but back to the year 1900. I recommend this book for all history lovers who like a bit of fantasy and a lot of romance.",1
Char-Griller Side Fire Box: I have only tried it once so far but it seems to work perfect; looking forward to using it more this summer,1
"broken up to small pieces: The chips tasted stale and were so broken up from poor packaging that I could only eat a few from each bag. The bags were crammed into a box that was lightweight, and thus, the problem. I will not be ordering them again.",0
GREAT BOOK!: A thorough look at the relationships between Jimmy Hoffa and the Mob. I always wanted to know the real truth behind the Hoffa disappearance and this book tells it like it is. Absolute truth after reading is a no brainer. A very good book told by the man that killed Jimmy Hoffa. They also unearth the Crazy Joe Gallo murder in Little Italy in the 70's. I lived through all of this and was mesmerized by it then but could never find out the truth. Well here ya go...Its all here for you. I reccommend this book to everybody out there that is interested in the underworld and the truth behind some murders that you never knew.,1
Good information: I found the information good. Specifically I liked the review of design options for a surfboard and their relation to performace. It was what I was looking for.,1
"Spirit lifting and Soul awakening: This is a book I have read for years....it centers me and makes me aware of mind, body and soul. Healing and conscious awakening. Sets your spirit in a loving, caring place. Highly recommend. Great for gift giving.",1
"Insight and directions for a satisfying spiritual life.: For anyone who has reached a 'dry' place in their spiritual life, Pastor Blunt offers a truly new perspective on reaching a way of life where I can have intimacy with God. It's not about 'formulas' but about principles that deepen my relationship with God. The author is clearly writting about what he has learned in his own walk with God. Highly recommended if you are ready to grow.",1
"Amazing, Beautiful Spirits: I enjoyed this book very much! Being an owner of two of my own wolf-dogs, I could identify with this author and his wife. It is an amazing & unforgetable journey. Many trials, but it is all worth it! Animals are such wonderful teachers, as Lobo was. For you, Lobo, thank you.",1
Ridiculous: Ok people.. there are actually two bolts that hold your rack together. Why would this lock make your rack secure? Any idiot could just unscrew the other bolt and get anything you had on your rack plus most of the rack itself. This product is completely ridiculous. The design of this bike rack is very lacking. They should design the rack with security in mind and not charge extra for it. Seriously.. isnt that part of their job? Who would want to buy a rack that is easy to steal? If you bought this rack then you are much better off just using a chain and a decent lock to chain it all together and chain it down to your hitch.,0
"Ouch.: This is the worst movie I saw in a theater. No one with an iota of good sense should see it. It cheapens the historical event it intends to honor. Even the explosions, the one thing Michael Bay can do well, aren't worth watching.Spend your money on From Here to Eternity instead.",0
"Ugh: Yes, I'm not gonna deny that the singer has a great voice. And the band plays very well. But I also liked them back in 1993 when they were called RADIOHEAD!Come on guys, be a little original! Don't waste that voice trying to imitate someone! Do your own thing, I'm usre it'll work out fine.I'm giving them an extra star because of their ability, but I'm feeling VERY generous!",0
"MARVIN PAUL FARBER COMMITTED SUICIDE AS PER THE HARRIS COUNY CORONER'S OFFICE IN HOUSTON TEXAS: Mr. Farber left me several ink hand signed books of his all dedicated to ""his best friend"" and my name. I had known him from about age 9 until the day before he shot himself with a .38 caliber pistol in his small tiny little apartment in a hispanic neighborhood of southwest Houston on a Friday the 13th. He was atleast to me a kind, warm hearted and loving man and I shall always miss him. What is important is that his memory not be besmurched by the statement that he was murdered - he was NOT - but rather he killed himself because he was in severe pain suffering greatly since 1990 from advanced mutliple sclerosis and HE WANTED TO DIE. May his soul & his memory live in peace always. I do NOT claim to have been his blood brothers but he thought of me as his brother that much I know for a fact.",0
Terrible product: This film was delivered to me in good packaging. But upon removing it from the packaging i discover how wrinkled it was.Secondly with all the tools and tint soap the tint was the worst to put on. I have done alot of tinting in my days and this tint by far is poor quality and not worth your money.,0
"Save Our Sounds: One of my favorite History channel programs. The program is about ten years old now, so I'm sure the technology used to save our sounds has improved. In any case, it is important work and I hope our government continues funding for this preservation project.",1
"This movie was very bad!: I was very dissapointed by this movie. It started out okay, but then it dragged on and on. It was so stupid and pointless. The only good character in the movie that I cared about was Teddy! He was so cute and funny. Anyway, don't rent or buy this movie becuase it is a waist of your time and money.",0
"Does not hold 8 cups: I ordered this product because it is similar to an undershelf wine glass holder which I really like. Although it has 8 hooks, it does not hold 8 coffee mugs. I even tried my smaller fine china coffee cups and they nested on the hooks, which would eventually lead to chipping. It barely fit over the cabinet shelf, although the closely spaced hooks are the main problem. Buy this product only if your coffee/tea cups are very small.",0
"Ha Ha: Don't even waste your time reading the reviews, buy this book and start reading NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This series, the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini, and the Goose Girl series should be required reading for every young adult girl on the planet,",1
"Boring: Totally unoriginal in its plot. Couldn't hold my attention for long, because the ending is so easy to figure out. Even if you are accepting of about all costume romance, this may try your patience.",0
"Rock On!!!!!!!!!: It is quite amazing to me to see so many wonderful songs on one CD. There is not one song on the CD that I do not like. I love all of them. You can also see how Def Leppard has evolved over the course of a decade and a half. You have ""Bringin' On The Heartbreak"", then you have songs like ""Rock Of Ages"" and ""Photograph"" in the mid-80's ""Pyromania"" days. In the late 80's, Hysteria came out, and songs like ""Animal"", ""Armageddon It"", and ""Hysteria"" showed how the band had refined it's sound and would continue to do so in the 90's with hits like ""Let's Get Rocked"", ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"", and also ""Miss You In A Heartbeat"". Def Leppard is one of the best bands ever and this is a wonderful greatest hits package that anyone who loves rock n' roll will love. And I also love the intro to ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" !",1
"No Words Can Describe The Final Chapter In The El Mariachi Trilogy Except EPIC.: Antonio Banderas returns to the role that made him a star in DESPERADO, which also made Robert Rodriguez a household name and a star out of Salma Hayek. And this time, it plays out in epic fashion, like the final chapter in Sergio Leone's ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."" Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Eva Mendes, Danny Trejo, Mickey Rourke, Enrique Iglesias and Cheech Marin also star. A fitting conclusion to the story continued in DESPERADO (I've not seen EL MARIACH, so I can't comment on it). Star power, a smartly written story and explosive action combine to make an action-packed good time. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.",1
"Buyer Beware: This item is listed as a ""spray cleaner carton"" and then goes on to clearly indicate that there are ""24 - 3-Ounce bottles per carton.""You can imagine my disappointment when one 3 ounce bottle showed up after paying $3.47 for the product and $5.74 for shipping (TOTAL $9.33).I figured the shipping was so high because the package would consist of 24 bottles.Outrageous, frivolous, and downright THIEVERY!!!",0
"Enjoyed frisbee, but light stopped working after moderate use: Only used on maybe 5-6 frisbee games. Used it lighted for 2 of these games.LED stopped working, figured it was a battery problem, but swapping the battery doesn't solve the problem. Seems to be a problem with the electrical contacts or the switch.Can't locate a warranty.If anyone has a fix, please share!",0
Starts off great but runs out of steam fast.: The show starts off great. Lauren Lee Smith for the first half hour is bewitching and hard to take your eyes off but then... it's over... by the end of the show she's just another whining jealous ex-lover pining away for her man.I have to give Eric Balfour a lot of credit for his lack of modesty. The scene where he is dancing naked with Smith needed a George Costanza voice over explaining the affects of shrinkage.All in all a horrible film and big waste of money.,0
"RIP-OFF: I HATE THIS ALBUM!!! The only good song on this album is the first one but the rest of them SUCK. The rest of the songs are only slow, acoustic crap. DON't BUY THIS ALBUM...PLEASE!!!",0
"great battery: this battery is just as good as the canon standard battery, and lasts long. I am very pleased with it.",1
"Software is junk, machine is SLOW and LOUD: I just want to save someone the headaches I've had since I bought this machine three months ago... I've had nothing but problems with software glitches since I installed this machine, I've had to uninstall and re-install three times, including spending an hour on the phone with customer support (who was great, and why this thing got two stars!) and even beyond that, this is the slowest, loudest printer/copier/scanner I've ever had. I thought this was sort of a 'higher end of the lower end' of all-in-one units, but this thing isn't worth much...sure wish I had my Epson still!!",0
"Probably gave me a sinus infection: After purchasing this Neti Pot, I used it, and later that day a friend asked ""You didn't use tap water, did you?"" The directions specify to use lukewarm tap water, but my friend claims this can be very dangerous and make you really sick. The next day, when blowing my nose, my mucus had a significant amount of blood in it, followed the next day by a very painful sinus infection that has so far lasted a week. Of course, I can't guarantee that this product caused it, but I won't be using it again without distilled water. Here's a NPR article describing how dangerous this can be:[...]",0
"They already did this without anyones help: poor, poor pm5k.........their never gonna get it right.........with each new release, they seem to knock off another better band..........with this release, they try to be the misfits, and it doesnt work.........the only good osngs on this entire album are ""wild world"", and ""murder"" save your cash...download these two tracks and forget the rest",0
"A Can't Miss CD: Any rock fan would be fool to miss this collection. It has all of their greatest hits. It has songs that will make your feet shuffle about in ""Wild-Eyed Southern Boys"" and ""Twentieth Century Fox"", while mixing in some mellower rock songs like ""Fantasy Girl"" and ""Caught Up In You"". Plus, it includes their other big hits such as the ballad ""If I'd Been The One"" and their all-time greatest hit, ""Hold On Loosely."" The price also makes this a can't miss for anybody who enjoys hard rock.",1
Karisatk: This movie was one of the worst movies . I have ever seen. It did not make any sense and the plot was meaningless. Do not buy this movie.It is a waste of your time.,0
good book: I bough this book to replace the one a friend loaned me and we lost. It was a good book and we shared it with friends.,1
"Rah! Rah! for the Ya-Ya's--Vital Women of the South: The Ya Ya Sisterhood is every woman's dream relationship with her fellow woman. The other as support and strength and vitality. How the men pale in comparison as lost loves or simply husbands. It's one woman's search for her mother as a person. The search for the feminine and balancing the ying and yang. How can she be an accomplished person when she doesn't know if her mother approves of her? How can she commit to the all-too-perfect love of her life if her mother doesn't love her? Reconstructing her mother's past and her relationship with the Ya Ya's helps her identify and solve her dilemna. A wonderfully thoughtful, yet joyful journey.",1
More than just a recipe collection: I like this book and flip through it quite often looking for inspiration. Beginners probably won't find it that useful as there are very few illustrations but most foodies will enjoy it. The author recounts memories from early life as they relate to food and so the book is more than just a bare recipe collection; it is eminently readable as well. I particularly like it because it provides a lot of simple recipes for the 'basics' and also gives a pretty good selection of make-ahead side dishes.,1
"If You Hate Plotless Movies, Read On!: Get Shorty was a very disappointing movie dumped on some good actors. John Travolta, Rene Russo, and Gene Hackman do O.K. with the hopelessly aimless plot they are given. I found this movie a torture to watch. The script is very weak and what plot there is skips back and forth like a hopscotch game. There is no persuasiveness or depth to this movie. If you like well-crafted plots and movies that enable empathy with the characters, avoid this movie!",0
"AWESOME MOUSE: The Logitech MX700 does NOT disappoint.The installation was a snap. I set it up, let the included batteries charge overnight and I was good to go. The batteries last quite some time. It was a bit of a change to place the mouse in the recharging cradle nightly, but once you get used to it, it's a no brainer.The mouse works well on all surfaces, including solid black. My MS Intellimouse Optical refused to track on my black desktop. Performance is second to none.If you are looking for a full featured, realiable wireless mouse, you will find it with the Logitech MX700.",1
Don't do it!!!: The price on these was to good to be true.....you might think that these would be just as good as the more expensive ones! THEY ARE NOT!!! they lasted about 3 weeks before they started cutting out.,0
"The most stupid phone ever made: I am wondering why there is no rating of 0 star or even negative stars, sony errison desn't even deserve the 1 star I chose.This riduculosly stupid phone has one big button and a so-called ""Joystick"", both just need one single touch for you to get into the ""M-mode"", and get charged by every bit of data transferred to your phone. And there is absolutely no way to deactiviate it, even if you spend more than two hours to just get the unprofessional AT&T; or Cingular customer service to deactivate this stupid service on their end.Another stupid thing is that they send me a software CD which is totally crap. There is nothing in the package talking about the CD, but I just thought why wouldn't have a try. The stupid hand-made-like software just can never be succefully installed, and what is worse is that you can no longer uninstall it either.[...]",0
"great for the price: I wanted an extra powersupply for my toughbook, and this was priced UNBELIEVEABLY low. It came right away, and it works. It is a bit flimsy,,, but it is not my main use item. It WAS so cheap that i tried to order two at the same time,,, but the vendor would not let me. If it lasts... its another amazon-ACE deal.",1
"One of the very best: I get a kick out of the ""1 Star"" reviewers who thought it was too repetitive, or too long, or just didn't get it.Keep in mind, this novel is written in a unique style that takes some getting used to. I remember the first time I read it, I didn't get it at all for about 100 pages and actually stopped reading it. But then my sister said it was the best book she ever read, so I reread it with a new perspective.The ""running gags"" are my favorite parts, but just the way it is narrated is refreshing, even thought the book is 50 years old. If you have a small home library, this book should be a part of it.It's hard to rate my favorite books, because there are so many types of books that are so different. But I would definitely put this in my overall Top 10.",1
"What a fantasy!: This is a treat to look through years of Beard's incredible scrapbooks and imagine yourself among all the wilderness, the wild animals, the wild women, the wild times. Truly a male fantasy. You never tire of looking at it and discovering new images every time.",1
What a treasure ~ !!!: I love this book. Being a single christian is hard on it own. This book give insight on the true call of the single christian.,1
"Tech Review: I purchased this external optical drive to go with my new mini laptop. It works great, is silent, and fast. I love it. The only draw back for me, is that it is slightly heavier and larger than the laptop. This is not a big deal though, as it is quite sturdy and well made. I believe it will travel well and will be extremely useful for those times when I am provided CD/DVD materials as opposed to flash drives.",1
"The Syncing is off on the videos: Did you just lay out $120 for the Pink Floyd WYWH Immersion Set? Have you watched 'Welcome to the Machine'? Are you upset that the syncing of the animation and the music are WAY off. Same with ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"". I feel EMI should send us all replacement discs with this FIXED.[...]",0
"good and hot: This makes good and hot coffee. Well made, brews a full pot fast (5 min, roughly) and hot. Hot was important to me, I like steaming hot coffee. It's not as hot as a percolator, but its satisfying. The carafe works well, too. I spent what seemed like too much money, but I've been pleased.",1
"I can't deny it....it's really bad: Don't buy this disc...It stinks. No, I'm not talking about Rod's voice...I'm talking about over-production, overuse of electronic, synthetic, sampled garbage. Rod has real talent...he should use it. If you like ""Every Picture Tells A Story"" or ""When We Were The New Boys"", stay away from this one.",0
"Dont turn out the lights: I first read this book as a teen and was so intrigued with it. It scared the heck out of me. I was looking online and found it and had to buy it. This story has evil dark secrets, heart wretching scenes of sibling love and a wicked good ending. This is about the sins of the past haunting and taking revenge on the descendants of a family line. And it get where it really hurts ... the babies. This is a sick twisted look at how far pain and dispair will take you and how the love of family will cause someone to survive at all costs. I recommend this book to anyone that loves a great mystery and good scares. There is no racey scenes or really foul lanuage.i think that you will like this.",1
"why after one cd?: Give me a break.The band is terrible and it doesn't matter who's playing on it.John is a great singer but not here,not with those songs.Bruce can't play rock or metal he's a session guy and always will be.The two other guys well if you saw the band live it's far to be a driving machine the drummer is very very green and not very good and the bass player is washed-up.If you want a live album buy something else.Plus it's the same songs as the first and only cd so why ? Money ? Probably learned it from Kiss !",0
"These Were Great!!!!!!: After seeing the painting by J.L. David, ""The Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine"", I wanted to learn more about the woman who was kneeling at the foot of the altar--Josephine. I was looking for something that would be enjoyable to read and would give me information. These 3 books were perfect! They were not hard to read at all, because I'm 13 years old and I undertstood them(of course, you can't exactly go by my judgement; I read Hamlet and understood it). I liked how they were written in a diary format. It's like you are reading Josephine's inner thoughts. Even though they are fiction, they are packed with historical facts. If you want to know more about this amazing woman, enjoy history, or just want a good read, these are the books for you!!",1
"overrated: I tried to read this book, but it was too silly. Not lighthearted, just simply SILLY! Could not finish it. The ridiculous Wendy, so boring.",0
"Do you love shooting?: I just wanted to put a note in here that this is an extremely fun game if you love to shoot.This game is also excellent for people who do not like the nauseating experience from other shooting games that shake the screen too much as you move.Even though the stages are replayed, they get harder and you get to unlock other paths not found in the arcade game ( I believe)I had a blast with this game!",1
"Simply THE BEST Version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION: In my opinion, this film is the very best version of film adaptations of Jane Austen's PERSUASION. The casting seems perfect and the subtle physical transformation of Amanda Root (Anne Elliot) is incredible. Having recently seen the new PBS/Masterpiece Theater version (didn't like the casting on that one), I think that the only place that it excelled over this version was in making the relationship between Mrs. Clay and cousin Elliot clearer--that the cousin wanted not only to marry Anne so he could inherit the estate, but to also have Mrs. Clay as his mistress on the side to prevent her from marrying Sir Walter Elliot and possibly producing a male heir to beat him out of the property. That flaw was probably due to some footage ending up on the cutting room floor. Overall, however, this earlier version is vastly superior and may be my favorite adaptation of all the Austen novels to date.",1
"Never received chocolate! Avoid!: Company delivered chocolate, but it was stuck at post office and never arrived. Promised to resend. Product never arrived. Avoid!",0
"Ho-Hum: I was looking for a starting point for making bags...this is not it. They have a few cool bags, but I was looking for something a little more ""practical"" and frankly, a little more ""cool"". You know? Buy this book if you want a coffee table book, but don't buy it for anything else...",0
"Incredible book!: When I purchased this book I was hoping for a great chase and I really got one. Once I started reading, it was hard to put down. I felt like I was chasing Booth myself. It's a very fun read and if you are a Lincoln fan, this is a great book to read and enjoy.",1
"A phone book of characters in an inane novel: This book cannot be read without, to quote Peter Medawar, ""a desperate gasping and flailing around for sense."" Although it starts off promisingly enough, this book quickly degenerates into semi-philosophical musings and one-dimensional characters. To make things worse, the reader is expected to keep track of a multitude of minor characters who crawl over and mess up everything, like ants at a picnic. Save your money and read the white pages instead.",0
"Wholley Disappointing: I love anything Irish and this book was enthusiastically recommended to me by a friend. Well, I wish I would have saved the $14.00 I paid for it at Barnes & Noble and bought it used at Amazon or eBay for $0.69 or something. I agree with A. Scanlon's review (although they obviously are more learned on the subject) - I keep thinking to myself as I'm reading, ""Okay, can you get to the POINT, man?"" Mr. Cahill keeps veering off into these long-winded asides and I haven't come across anything vaguely historical or comparable to other books I've read on the Irish ""civilization."" It simply does not hold my interest. But, in all fairness, I should probably finish it, but I have a feeling it's going to be a real chore.",0
Runs small!: These boots are very nice. Too bad that I cant fit them. I wear a size 10 and they were too small. My girlfriend who wears an 8 fits them perfectly. I gave the boots to her for a gift. I would definitely recommend ordering a size up!,0
"THIS BOOK IS FANTASTIC: THIS BOOK IS A VERY GOOD BOOK. IT IS SO EASY TO READ. I LIKE THE WRITING STYLE OF THE AUTHOR. IT ONLY TOOK ME FOUR HOURS TO READ THE BOOK. THE BOOK HELP ME TO SEE THAT MY BEAUTICIAN HAS DONE A LOT OF BAD THINGS TO MY HAIR. (LIKE USING A LOT OF HAIR SPRAY AND GIVING ME PERMS TOO OFTEN.) I AM LOOKING FOR A NEW ONE AND THIS BOOK IS GOING TO HELP ME MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES THIS TIME. I THINK THIS BOOK IS FANTASATIC. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MY HAIR BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I LEARNED WHAT I SHOULD NOT DO TO IT IF I WANT HEALTHY HAIR.",1
geeat classic: This movie is for those who love comedy and an alternate reality of the present.A psychopathic general and the possible end of mankind. Peter sellers plays several persons in this great dark humor war story.,1
Very Basic: This book is very very basic with common sense ideas on how to start a practice. Not much real help.,0
"Cool Music: This is def a good cd, I heard of Anthony Robustelli, when i got a free sampler cd from the big summer classic in brooklyn, and the cd blew me away so i bought this album. Itz a really cool cd, that had funk, soul, and jazz all mixed in for a grooving feeling.. he composing songs extremely well, and the cd has its fast flowing songs, along with itz slow jazzy songs.. If you like, Soul, Jazz, and Funk, you'll really enjoy this cd.",1
Worked great! Until it didn't.: It gave great foam for the first six months and didn't run through batteries too quickly. Then it stopped working altogether at about 7 months out. It was getting used about three or four times a week (at most) during it's life so I'm thinking next time I'll just buy the $2 one at Ikea and say goodbye to this dude.,0
"NOT his screenplays: This is a book of photographs, which I wish it said on the cover or the description. I thought it was a book of his screenplays, which would make it great reading and valuable indeed. You can't judge a book by its cover for sure.",0
NOT ENOUGH POWER TO DO THE JOB: I PLACED THIS PRODUCT UNDER MY EXO TERRA TERRARIUM BUT WITH ONLY 8 WATTS OF POWER IT DID NOT HELP DRY OUT THE SUBSTRATE IN THE TERRARIUM SO I AM BUYING THE EXO TERRA DESERT HEAT WAVE IN A LARGER SIZE WHICH IS 25 WATTS AND AM SURE IT WILL DO THE JOB AS I HAVE USED THEM IN THE PAST.,0
"Tales told by a fruit-loop: <sigh> Here we go again ..More than 90% of people think David Fraudster Icke's books are revealing and truthful. How sad. How very very sad. You people are seriously ill if you believe this noted con artist and deceiver is revealing anything other than misdirection and bulldust.Then again, given how conditioned, programmed and brainwashed society is today people will easily fall for any kook who says something they ""feel"" is right. No questions asked, Three bags full.Stay away from this book if you value your sanity. Then again, since most people are braindead already it won't matter much and will just be IcKEing on the cake. hehehe",0
"Nelly lost his touch: i hate when rappers come out with a remix of their best tracks, it's so boring you've already heard the tune be4 but it's just fliped---nelly just changed some beats and added a fewe artist---there is a good side to the album tho' becuz it has the new hit single Iz U---even tho' this isn't nelly's greatsest track nor is it the worst-- the only reason you should buy this cd is you're bored of the original verson and wantto her the remixes or as nelly likes to say the renivationsp.s. go cop nellyville or country grammer first so u kno the differences w/ the remixes-",0
"Battery Life Unacceptable: Just like every other review, the batteries suck but it works well when it works. Collar is much too stiff for the right fit on a small dog.",0
"WHAT A WASTE OF PAPER! TRASH!: I thought this would be entertaining, interesting atleast, but is it? Of course not! This is the stupidest book I have ever read and I hate it. There was nothing helpful, nothing on Chaos Magick, it's a bunch of inane chatter with about twenty words on each page with rediculous pictures. I HATE THIS BOOK!",0
a good memory: I got this card and I am completely satisfied with it. It has had no problems and I cannot remark on its speed as this is the first compactflash card i have had. I just cannot figure out how to get the rebate for it yet.,1
"Bedford Intro to Drama: I love this book and how it gives the history of the plays, the period it was created in and information about the playwrights. I bought this book because my granddaughter is studying theatre and was having problems understanding the language usage of plays dating back to the Roman/Greco period and medieval times. Together we correspond over our webcams and go over the text. I actually enjoy it more than she does. Perhaps it is because I don't have to take the tests or write the papers.",1
"Cheaters: Cheaters was a very real book that takes whoever reads it into someone elses life. Through lies, cheaters and real friends. It shows how cheaters cheat and how the ones that get cheated on react. It's sad, funny , and crazy at times and it tells it all like it is.",1
"Exhilarating: This movie delivers fun with a punch. The coupling of sheer thrill of escapism and banal reality doesn't get any better than this. I enjoyed it tremendously despite considering myself fairly unacquainted with the overarching ""culture"" the story is set in.The profound attention to detail (casting, characters, musical score, pacing, backdrops and numerous other unknown transparent factors) that went into the making of this exquisite movie is hard to miss.",1
Failed On First Day: I bought this charger a few weeks ago and it shorted out the first day when I plugged it in.,0
"Excllenent vampire film that transcends the genre!: I'm not sure if I agree with the blurb on the DVD cover about this being ""the best vampire movie ever,"" but if Terrance Mallick was Swedish and decided to make a vampire/suspense movie starring two tweens it might've come out like this film. So much is communicated without language in this film. 'Let the Right One In' quiet and slow paced yet never tedious. The cinematography & directing are both equally beautiful and unsettling, and the performances by the two child leads are compelling throughout.",1
"Nice, but a little pricey: Bought this to throw in my BOB, it's nice, smaller and lighter than I anticipated which is good for keeping the real estate in my bag a little less crowded. The downside is that it only carries a limited amount of supplies. Basically, if someone get's shot on the hunting trip you can hold them over, if two people were shot the 2nd guy would be out of luck. (which I suppose would be pretty unlikely) Anyhow, I also like that there is a survival and first aid book to walk you through details as well as little note cards in each individual pouch explaining what supplies to use for different types of injuries. In all I'd say you could probably piece this together with more of the crucial supplies yourself for less, but if you're lazy and just want it done for you, then this is it.",1
Interesting: For someone new to online dating this info could be helpful. It's all about snaring a man off a dating site. It's different.,1
"Don't bother.: Save your money. After two weeks, it starts to completely dry out. It did remove some of my plantar's wart, but you're probably better off getting the gel.",0
"An overkill textbook: As a textbook for an accounting systems class, this text is extremely cumbersome and long-winded. The authors seem to want to beat every subject to death, which results in excrutiatingly long chapters. Much of the material may be relevant to information systems majors taking it in a series of two classes, but is probably not suitable for an accounting major class. The writing style is boring and cryptic in many places. Look into the Gelinas/Sutton/Oram or Bodnar/Hopwood books for much better content and readability.",0
"Great Recording!: The best tracks in this CD to me personally are Mad Scene Aria from Lucia (2nd track) and Dongshimcho (the last track). So, so, so beautiful! Since I heard her singing first 12 years or so ago, I have always been a most loyal fan of hers. She just has the most pure and beautiful, if not the most powerful, voice. And the way she looks when singing is genuinely beautiful as well. Definitely a must-have for any classical music fan who can value the real quality rather than the commerically blown-up success! One more tip: The CDs and DVDs by Korean artists such as Shin are more readily available at a website called HanBooks.com. Fast delivery and lower price.",1
"love it!: In my search for a great dip book, I found it in this one. I did a lot of searching and browsing and came upon this book. The recipes are easy to make and delicious. I also like the little tidbits at the beginning of eat recipe, along with recommended dippers.",1
Good program with nice graphics: I was able to make some nice business cards using both my own photos and the program's graphics. Labels are nice too. The only problem I had was the program having all the types and styles of cards and labels I could purchase. I struggled a bit figuring out how to print on some sheets. It would have been nice to have better directions or help subjects in order to answer my questions. For the price it is a good program.,1
"Keep Your Cash: The title says it all, I mean how desperate are you for a movie plot, the animated version was better.",0
"In simple terms: do not read this book: This is simply a bad and boring book. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is strained, the storyline incoherent and much too bloody. I can`t beleive anyone who has read Auel can like this.",0
"Disappointing movie: Being a die-hard Star Wars fan, I was very disappointed with this film solely because of the acting. Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor were the two bright spots in the movie, but Hayden Christensen was horrible. I know that he's portraying the downfall of the main character, but I was very disappointed. As far as Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson, I feel that they could have replaced them both with cardboard cutouts. The acting on both parts was just plain flat.I enjoyed the action scenes (I laughed out loud during Yoda's lightsaber battle) but I cringed everytime Anakin and Padme were on the screen.",0
I am glad not the first one: My son seems to likes parts of this video but not nearly like any of the others. Baby Mozart is by far the best one of the series. Any of the other DVD's work to keep my sons attention. If Baby Newton were the first one we had purchased we never would not have bought anymore. Maybe when my son is older he will like this one better. But at 1 year he has no interest. I would not waste my money on this one for a younger baby. You are better off getting Baby Mozart or one of the Baby Dolittles.,0
"Good Hulk Fun!: This volume covers issues 40-43 of The Incredible Hulk 2nd series. Breathtaking art from John Romita Jr(enhanced by the improved coloring process and the good-quality paper). Bruce Jones' writing style is quite different from past Hulk authors but perhaps that's part of his appeal. I like how he uses Banner's transformation sparingly, to help build suspense. Overall, this Hulk volume is a good read and is highly recommended.",1
"A real joy: I bought this CD for the Schumann 4th. I have his 4 symphonies in Sawallisch interpretation which I like very much (the Dresden Staatskapelle is wonderfully caught), but in the case of the 4th, I have always found his tempi were too quick. This is particularly evident in the first movement, where Sawallisch seems too hurried and also in the beautiful slow movement. In contrast, Furtwaengler tempi in the four movements immediately win you over. The sound is dated, of course, but the ears quickly adjust, and musically it's a wonderful experience. The Haydn too is a joy to hear. Highly recommended.",1
"Bulky, feels gross, not worth ordering: I read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart, which worked nicely. I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately.",0
"Very good vacuum for the price: I was pleased to find how well this vacuum works. It picks up everything visible on the first pass, and is so powerful you barely need to push it, so the whole floor is done quickly. It is easily switched from floor to hose, or from carpet to bare floor. The bag is easy to change, and both the bags and the Hepa filter are helpful for indoor allergy control. The headlight is especially bright and well-placed. The only problem I've had with it is that the onboard storage for tools could use some improvement. I seem to keep knocking tools out of place, sometimes when wrapping or unwrapping the cord, but that is a relatively minor problem with this effective and easy-to-use vacuum cleaner.",1
Salamunovich and Lauridsen are Masters with THE CHORALE: Robert Shaw and Roger Wagner [ God rest their souls ] must rest assured that the Choral art is in such hands.It is a blessing that the talents of Paul and Morten are available to us in the twenty first century.BRAVO ! AD MULTOS ANNOS!,1
"Yamaha RH2C Headphones: 'BAD' in just three letters.This is the lowest quality YAMAHA product I have ever used. I own a lot of YAMAHA musical instruments/PA equipment including Speakers, but this is the worst I ever came across.Horrible in every aspect, from the production quality to sound.YAMAHA should discontinue this product and prevent further brand erosion.",0
"Good value but.....: It was designed too small for a Canon Rebel 300 with a short lens and shoulder strap. The camera and lens will barely fit in the case without the camera strap. (Even if the camera strap were removed, the strain on the nylon zipper would soon lead to zipper failure.) The concept of a case of that type and utility at such a good price was great, too bad it is not practical. Too bad.",0
Our son's favorite: AT 19 months he loved dancing to Bill Staines' songs. We often play Little Cowboy Lullaby before he goes to bed - now at 20 months he will go and put it on himself. We are getting 4 copies for the rest of the family for Christmas.,1
"Best since TR3025: In my opinion is this the best TR since 3025. The picures are of good quality, and there are loads of new battlemechs and vehicles. The book introduces a new clan weapon the ""protomech"", and give you the rules how to use and build them. All in all an excelent piece of work with loads of information about all the mechs and vehicles.",1
Easy to use: The layout of the keyboard really makes it easy to use this device. I find myself looking for things to label. It's great. I love the built in feature that facilitates removing the backing from the label. It works brilliantly. The only thing I wish were different is that it does waste a decent amount of tape before and after the printed text. Small issue and doesn't diminish my overall impression of the unit.,1
"Too strong: Oh dear, where can I start? Well, hubby took a whiff of this and instantly said, ""No hun. That does not smell good."" To top it off, it made me feel dizzy. I had to scrub it off of me. Glad I purchased a sample and not the full size.",0
"slight disappointment: I was hoping for more images and pictures based on the description of this product. I recieved the book and it was very light in weight, felt like I purchased a paperback....even though it is hard cover....the quality of paper and print is not of a collectors edition for the typical collector.",0
"Detailed look at Chinese politics: Everyone knows that Deng Xiaoping dramatically altered China's political and economic landscape. Few, however, realize to what great lengths he stretched himself to do so. Dr. Michael Marti gives a detailed inside look at the factional wrangling that dominated Chinese political affairs in the early 1990s, which set China upon its current developmental path. Well-written, well-documented research, easy-to-read despite the density of information provided, I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Chinese politics.",1
"Oh My God.: So this is the prequel? I can't believe this book received a good grade. J.M. Barrie already wrote a great prequel to Peter Pan (Peter Pan In Kensington Gardens), so I don't see why these two authors felt the need to write another one. There's just no mystery, no excitement, no...nothing. If you're a fan of the original, most likely you'll find yourself disappointed.",0
How Sad...: I love Jesus Christ with all of my heart. I am from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (His name is FIRST!)and that does not mean I love Him any less. This book does not contain all of the facts and is not fair.,0
"Very POORLY Designed!!: I bought this bag because it looks great and seemed very comfortable. However, when I got it home and tried to pack it for my newborn I realized it just wouldn't work. The design is not well thought out at all...the bottle holders on the inside make it hard to organize and fit much of anything without having to stuff it all inside. And my baby's items are still VERY small! Also, I don't know about other bags but the changing pad on this one seems very narrow and short...again okay for a tiny infant but would not be useful for an older baby.",0
"Fantastic!!!!!: This pedometer is the best. Makes my goals easier to obtain, while keeping track of my progress. After purchasing mine, I ordered another for my husband.",1
Best usage for me was on my wet hair: The product just glides on the hair when wet which means less friction on the hair. I then blew dried my hair. May have to reapply for the moisture but may leave your hair a little frizzy if you use to much of the product when the hair is dry. This product is paraben-free and propylene glycol-free.Made in Canada,1
Trans Rocks: You have a be a fan of the style of music Transiberian Orchestra plays. I'm a fan of theirs and this album includes some classical undertones which makes this it even better than their normal creations.,1
"Carpentry Textbook: When starting out with very basic knowledge of carpentry and building, this is the perfect book for learning. This book explains many aspects of carpentry, tools, and equipment. This book also explains the importance of zoning and would be beneficial for all interested in the construction or carpentry industry. You could benefit from this book if you are interested in making improvements to your land or home.",1
Favorite book growing up: I think every child and adult should read this book. It's hilarious and imaginative. Roald Dahl writes the best children books. This book also made want to go into science,1
"Wonderful, informative and great illustrations: As a real nature lover and biologist I was very impressed by the detail in this book. I can't wait to give it to my friend's kid to see if he likes it as much as I do!",1
"You never knew anyone could fail to make a box. Until you see this.: Amazon sent me this thing, and sadly I didn't open up the box until it was too late to return it. They sent me one that clearly someone else had been using, or trying to use, until they gave up because it's awful. The one they sent me is filthy, missing all the screws that you are supposed to use to put it together, and full of holes from where the last person tried. I tried too, because I figured at this point, why not? It doesn't fit together right, the doors don't stay shut...and that's sitting on my living room floor. I can't even imagine how fast this would fall apart if I actually put it outside. If I could give it zero stars, I would, but the site won't accept a review without at least one star.",0
"Breathless Perfume by Victoria Secret: In my opinion this is the best perfume ever. I was very disappointed when Victoria Secret discontinued it. The scent lasts for hours after applying. And the scent is amazing. Not overly floral, NO musk what so ever, not fruity- just perfect. Very feminine. I was so excited to see that I was still able to purchase it through other vendors who had apparently bought extra stock.",1
"AMAZING ALBUM!!!: Definitely two of my top 5 favorite CDs right now. The first album is a little slower-paced, and the second one has a little more dance feel to it. Great chill out music to relax to that will take you to another place! ;-)",1
"Great pumps: Relatively comfortable pumps and great looking - I can typically wear them all day without pain until about the end of the day when the toe pain kicks in a bit. they are suede, so the back of the heel gets that shiny look to it if you wear them driving, but that happens to all suede shoes. Overall a great shoe for the discounted price and very wearable",1
Finally... The worst movie EVER: This is a total waste of time with no redeeming features.Could have just set up a camera in front of some lower middle class high-school on the last day of school of and come up with a move better than this.Don't waste your money on this like I did!!!!!!!,0
awsome!!!!!: The best boots by far that i have ever owned. my buddy got a pair of oakley SF boots the same time i got mine. we both wear them everyday and his are falling apart like a cheap sneaker....!,1
"I took a chance and glad I did: I hesitated for one year in ordering the pie shields because of the negative reviews. I finally decided to take a chance because I've been using the four piece foil shields and hate them every time I did use them. I am so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews because I love them. I got the smaller one for Mrs. Smith's or Sara Lee frozen pies and they fit perfectly. The larger one fits my glass pie crust baking dish.I also got a silicone one for the bigger ones, just to try. I love all three just don't expect the smaller one to fit your large pie dishes or the the larger one to fit the frozen pies. Each one has it's use depending on what you use the most. Two should do the trick. As far as the crust getting too brown I check it when I have 10 minutes left and either take it off to keep it from getting much browner or leave it on to perfection. Hope this helps all of you that are undecided. One of those items that I say *why did I wait so long.*",1
"Left wing extremist political views ruined it for me.: The book had great potential but the author ruined it for me by inserting his left wing extremist political views into the story. He tried to make the reader believe that all right wing conservatives are racists, what absolute bigotry. He villified legitimate gun dealers with the false assumption that a person can hold a valid Federal Firearms License after being convicted of a drug offense, what utter nonsense.",0
"Best cookbook ever: Thank God for this book (well, Diane Philips should get some credit, too!). It is PACKED FULL of great recipes, plus tips for doing them ahead of the party so that the hostess isn't totally frazzled by dinnertime. It has variations of many of my favorite standby recipes, plus new ones with updated flavors. Excellent.",1
Lasted about a week past the warranty: Worked well for about three months and then started leaking out the bottom. Just after the 90 day warranty expired. Will never waste money on Mr. Coffe products again.,0
DO NOT BUY for toasting: I agree with most the posts here. I bought this in hopes of baking small items without needing to use my large kitchen oven but ALSO to toast bread daily. The toasting feature is absolutely horrible. The toast needs to cook for a VERY long time and you need to stop and rotate the bread or it will burn on one side and be untoasted on the other. Very disappointing product. I do not recommend!,0
"I ordered this , and returned it: I ordered this checkbook wallet , and when i recieved it , I ralized it was too small, I could not even get my check book to fit into it. I contacted Belt Outlet and was told I could return it and my money would be returned to me. it was supposed to have a 100% guarantee.I returned the item , and have not heard from Belt Outlet , nor Amazon.com , nor has my money been credited back into my account, as I asked. This item was ordered and returned in December. 2006.",0
"Must Have for Toddlers!: This Alphabet Bus is awesome helping toddlers learn their ABCs. It not only sings the alphabet song but it tells you the letter when pressed and it tells you words that begin with the specific letters. At 19 months, my daughter loved it! The alphabet song can be memorized with time but this toy teaches letter recognition... awesome for learning! I would HIGHLY recommend this toy for learning ABCs and Letter Recognition. Money well spent!",1
"Not what I expected: I ended up sending this book back. Didn't like the formatting of recipes. While it did identify which recipe was associated with which blood type, this was not very clear. There also seemed to be a lot of ingredients that were not available in the typical grocery store. I think the recipes could have been a little more user friendly. Time was needed to cook most of the recipes, not geared for a family on the go.",0
"Don't Waste Your Money!: So I planted up two of these topsy turvy and several other tomatoes in pots. Let's just say all the benefits it gives you.....larger plants, more tomatoes.....I have yet to see. My pots are twice the size of my Topsy Turvy's, loaded with fruit. The upside down plants have yet to produce any fruit. All were planted at the same time at the beginning of May. Also, they dry out very quickly.",0
Pure Garbage-don't waste your time!: This book has absolutely no plot at all. The sex scenes in this book are actually stomach churning. The characters in this book are a bunch of immorals with no redeeming qualities. It's like a bad porn movie with no plot!!!! This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read!!,0
"Unti does not have backup battery nor head phone jack.: Just bought an unit locally because it has a CD & dual alarm times. The radio reception is very spotty where I live and I need two alarm time settings. In addition, my MP3 units are not IPod.However, I am looking for a different unit because THERE IS NOT BATTERY BACKUP & IT DOES NOT HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK.I do like that a seperate MP3 plug in.",0
"Clicking is broken: I wish I had read the reviews. My first one of these was broken out of the box. About 20% of the left clicks didnt actually click. I thought it was a rare defect so I returned it for a replacement. After about 2 months, this new mouse is doing the same thing. I click and nothing happens, or I double click and it only registers a single click.What use is a mouse if it wont click!?",0
"Boring and free of music and creativity: Yawn. Another pile of rap steaming with stink. Justin Timberlake is not the least bit sexy or talented. Watching him on the VMAs he dances like a trained monkey in a chorus line, and his whiny voice is nasal, thin, and without any redeeming tonal qualities such as range or beauty or melodic presence. IMO, only the most tone deaf people would buy this load.Sexy Back is trite, juvenile and unutterably boring, the lyrics sound like jr. high schoolers panting over their personal libido. At age 25 or so, you would think Timberlake had matured a little and/or had gotten himself a bit of voice training.Not a chance.Here is a mean faced guy with a waay nasty attitude who ""dogs"" other artists and criticizes them for having no vocal talent. Talk about Projection! Timberlake should look at his own stuff before he EVER opens his mouth to sing OR rip at other artists. Save your bank. This CD hit the trash can after one spin.",0
"Flimsy, breaks easily: I have gone through 2 plastic Kensington keyboard trays in as many months! Not only do the screws fall out (I just read that using super glue will help this) but the screw sleeves on the tray are plastic and just crumble apart. Terrible product. And what a pain to have to remount another one after already having this thing attached to the underside of the desk--- do it right the first time and buy a different brand!",0
"Toaster Oven Baking Set: Awesome baking pans, easy to clean, and nest nicely. Helpful for me, since my storage space is very limited. Pans can be used in the toaster oven or regular oven. A great product!",1
"This is not the play.: I hear a lot of people claim that the ""No Fear"" editions are the best way to read Shakespeare, but if you're reading this book, then you are not reading Shakespeare. Well, actually, I suppose you may be reading Shakespeare on one half of the pages, but on the other half you're reading, oh, sort of the vague imprint of the play, like a track in the dust.You may think I'm just being a snob, but the truth is these ""translated"" versions that are all the rage these days just don't do the play justice, and the ""translations"" are misleading, because they take ambiguous language and pin one specific, modern definition to it, a definition which is often wrong and always too narrow. It's like eating soup out of a sieve; what you get out is simply not what you put in.If you want to read ""King Lear"", then read ""King Lear"", but don't waste your time with this distant cousin.",0
"Very disappointing film noir: As a huge film noir fan who was aware of this film's importance to various directors I admire, I was very interested in seeing this movie and then extremely disappointed by it. Some of the acting is fine but some of it is atrociously bad. The story is preposterous which would be fine if it were more entertaining. And the film as a whole is a big dud. If you're looking for great noir, check out ""Double Indemnity"", ""Chinatown"", ""The Maltese Falcon"" and others. Hell, even rent ""Detour""--low-budget and dated but far superior to this film.",0
"Dress Up That Wriggler: The original Wiggler Cover is a Plain Jane. If that's what you're looking for, fine.But, if you want to give the Wiggler a ""touch of class"" and ""beauty"", try the Sage Green Glazed Cover.",1
"within six mos there are rust spots all over: Title states it all. Very pretty altho shorter handles than I expected. Within six mos, over 40% have rust splotches...anywhere from where they were soldered together at joints to even where you put your mouth.",0
"laughable...: I remember forcing myself to read this hot mess of a ""novel"" almost 6 years ago. No shade, but I think it's totally pathetic that the author is posting comments w/ attitude based on the fact that this version of the book is now out of print. How is that relevant?? The point is that she put out a subpar product. Period. Who cares if it's been edited and revamped now? There are a lot of us who spent money supporting her in the beginning, but you decide to wait until AFTER folk spend money on your book to come correctly? And then want to cop an attitude because they give it ""bad reviews""? Disgraceful.Feel free to go ahead and rate this review ""not helpful"" - just like you did with all the other unfavorable reviews.",0
"Ok: This story is based on her life, it was interesting while reading it but looking back at it, it was kind of lame. I guess its just like every other celeb book..",0
"Powerful metaphors`: The way colours are used to represent different approaches to change is a powerful metaphor. Combined with the models presented in the book this offers managers a guideline to succesfuly implement change. The plentiful notes in the book lead to more background reading material. Do not skip the introductory chapters, I found them very interesting.",1
"Simply Christmas Music: I was searching for more of an acoustic type music, and this was too much piano. This is good if you like piano music.",0
"Boy was I fooled.: Ordered this Crock-pot as it's advertised as being made by Rival, which is a made in the USA company. Well surprise, when I receive the item, it's made in CHINA!No mention of RIVAL anywhere in paperwork or on the Crock-pot as shown in the picture. Company on sticker is Sunbeam, which has apparently taken over RIVALand now manufactures the items in china.,,,,, very disappointed as I was trying to buy American made product.I'm not going to return it, as other reviews state it's a very reliable item, but I am disappointed in the way it is advertised.",0
You're not getting what is shown: The picture shows the classic nut can we all remember - metal - and with a cloth-covered spring snake. This thing is a dinky plastic container with a very short plastic-covered snake. It has a round plastic top on the spring. When you open the plastic lid the snake slowly rises up about six inches and makes a squeaking sound. Not at all the big snake that jumps out with force. Cheap junk.,0
"Tandia: I found the book engrossing but slow to start just as the power of one but I never realy connected with tandia and I was to say the least dissapointed with PK. Even though i know the gaol was most likely to humanize him in this book. I felt his ideals and basic charecter remained the same but, for some reason the thought of him as a main stream adult didn't apeal to me as much as him as an adolescent child or even a mine worker. The ending is good but i wasn't sure it was done as well as it could have been but then agian my name isn't Bryce Courtney, i wonder if there is a sequal.",1
"Works on Verizon XV6800 with Windows Mobile 6: Bought this keyboard at a price low enough I was willing to take the chance for something that isn't officially supported.I downloaded the driver for the XV6700 and almost everything works as its suppose too. The exception(s) are the secondary 'blue' functions (shortcuts) don't seem to work. For example the ""J"" key has additional functions (almost all keys do) by pressing the blue ""Fn"" button, they are ""Notes"" and ""Apps."" On my PDA/phone the second shortcut function ""apps"" doesn't work, I only ever get the ""notes"" shortcut. For me this is only a minor issue that by itself wouldn't rate the one star reduction.The reason for the keyboard only getting four stars is the lack of a dedicated number row of keys.Overall worth the extreme deal Amazon had between Christmas and New Years.",1
TOTAL RIP-OFF: Incredibly boring book that takes advantage of the blair witch popularity. the burkittsville part is last and of course the shortest part of the book.,0
"Pretty good stuff except for the smell...: This product works well and fills a need, as there seems to be nothing like it in retail stores. However the smell is very strong, so beware if you are sensitive to chemical type odors.",1
"OK but not what I expected: This album consisted of 3 CDs. I was looking for traditional renditions of all hymns, but some definitely were presented with a folksy downbeat that I didn't appreciate. Of course, I'm a product of the early 1950s vintage hymn. Other than that, the sound quality was fine and the choruses were professional-sounding.Some would probably have rated this higher but they had different expectations.",0
"What Battery?: I concur with all comments concerning the battery. What a piece of [...]! Although I don't have this Panasonic model (I have a Panasonic KX TG2215 - unfortunately, a much more expensive model), the battery is equally worthless. I'm on my second (and LAST) battery within a year. I'm giving the phone to my girl friend's elderly mother who doesn't usually spend more than 15 minutes on the phone at a time, which is the absolute outer limits of the in-use-battery charge. I seriously doubt I will ever buy a Panasonic phone again.",0
not sturdy: this blender and its bottles are very useful. the bottels however are pooooorly made and break apart at the top where the lid screws on and the bottom.,0
"Great DVD with One Exception: This DVD could have been as good as they come: an intriguing film, mesmerizing dance sequences, great cinematography, and a soundtrack that makes the tango sound better than anything attempted before, if it weren't for one thing: the film is letterboxed at the wrong aspect ratio! So, fans, beware. This elaborate co-production utilizes some of the greatest talent from Argentina, Spain, Italy and the United States. Shot by Vittorio Storaro in Univision using Technovision cameras and lenses, ""Tango"" is supposed to be framed at 2:1, an aspect ratio that lies somewhere between the Academy Standard (1.85:1) and CinemaScope (2.35:1). But for the DVD someone approved a 1.75 transfer that hurts some of the exquisite compositions and the larger-than-life feeling the movie had in theaters. To confuse matters farther, the DVD jacket indicates the film is presented in the scope aspect ratio. Not!!! Aw, well, it's a very good movie nontheless.",1
Should have known better!: I took a chance on this cd and lost. I should have known better. The cd is completely spoon-feed material. If you are excited about your last purchase of Summer Ibiza Hits than this cd may be for you. This cd smacks of commerical dance music with stolen elemnts of the progressive house/trance sound. Some of the transitions are as smooth as gravel.,0
"Not Authentic dim sum cook book. Great recipe book with misleading title!!: This is no doubt a GREAT recipe book--easy steps, ordinary ingredients, beautiful photos with clear explaination. However, this is not an authentic dim sum cook book!! Most of the recipes--I will say more than 90% of them, are not ""dim sum"". I could see the author loves dim sum and she was also very creative, but putting ""dim sum"" equals ""Asian finger food"" doesn't feel right to me. Dim sum has its own origin and it refines very fine breakfast or brunch food that only served at ""tea restaurant"". Most dim sum don't serve with dipping sauce. Things like chicken skewer would never be called a dim sum dish... I guess if you are looking for a more authentic dim sum cook book, this should not be your first choice. However, if you are looking for a nice, easy cookbook of Asian style cuisine to delight your friends and family, this might just be the one!!",0
"Worthless: Buying this battery was probably the worst electronics purchase of my life. This new battery worked great for a few weeks. And then my phone died. Not only would the battery not charge, but the phone wouldn't turn on even when it was plugged into the wall.Look. You can buy a whole new phone for just a little more than the cost of this battery. Go do it.I swear, I will never buy another Motorola phone ever again.",0
"Regina Belle: Regina Belles Best of Cd is amazing! I love it from start to finish.Every single song is a hit! I have always respected her talent, and I am thrilled to have all of her hits on one Cd for my listening pleasure. This music sounds so good, that I could not take the Cd out until I had heard every single song on it, and I am pleased. This was a good purchase for sure.if you are fan of Regina Belle..do get this Cd asap.",1
"Perfect: Great book. Bought for our 1 year old son, hopefully he will have this a long time. The Berenstain Bear Books are great books with great meaning behind them. Helps to teach your children not to lie.",1
"Sci-fi, slapstick, horror, and more...: This movie cracked me up! Every scene in this movie made me laugh - sometimes it was a slapstick laugh and sometimes it was an ""oh my god, I can't believe they did that"" laugh. Patrick Voss (Robot Monkey Lab, special effects guru) wrote - with Adam Hackbarth - and directed this hilarious parody of two X-file-esque agents caught up in the alien abduction of a family of inbred rednecks. The special effects range from finely detailed to deliberately funny, but are all very well done and are the backbone of the entire movie showing the great talent of Patrick Voss and his crew. I guarantee you will have a great time watching this movie. I will warn you though that this movie has some really raunchy humor in it. Recommend highly!!!",1
"Great whistle: I bought this to replace the whiste my grandson got with his train set. The dog actually did eat it. The dog like this one too but I got it out of her mouth before she turned it into tooth picks.Grandson is two, and loves the whistle. Its just the right size for a child or adult. Easy to use and makes a very entertaining sound.",1

"without a doubt...the Worst Movie Ever !: This movie, without a doubt, is the worst movie I have ever seen. Anyone who enjoys movies, even terrible ones, will NOT want to see this movie. This is a complete waste of time & I was mad at myself that I sat through this movie for nearly 2 1/2 hours. All this movie was about was Englishmen & women sitting around talking, eating...Servants sitting around, working, talking and eating...the rich talking down to the servants...by the time the murder happened you will not care & even more so this is the most boring murder mystery ever...again all the detective did was talk to people who wouldnt talk to him.Trust me people, this movie ...",0
"This guy thinks he's so clever: Yeah - this is an interesting read, and well worth picking up. The content is naturally very complicated, centering on self-referencing systems and other mathematical mind-twisters, and I think the author's pompous approach of playing with those notions in his presentation of the ideas does less to illustrate the points than it does to confuse readers. If you have the patience to sit through a conversation with a serious mathematician with a penchat for puns, you'll gain some interesting new perspective from this one.",1
Painting Baby Animal Treasures: I cannot believe that someone is selling this for $298.47. The books original value was $22.99. This is not a collectors item and if you are looking for the book at a more reasonable rate see the authors web site and you can get a PDF version and save yourself alot of money.I love Peggy Harris' work and have almost all of her books. This book is fantastic!,1
"Stand Alone Plush Tiger: This tiger does what you'd expect it to do - nothing. It looks realistic which is great! My cats were completely freaked out by it. My daughter loves it and keeps it near her bed. If it was romped on inappopriately I'm sure the seams would start to rip after a while. As it stands, my daughter often sleeps with this (got it 4 months ago) and it shows NO signs of wear. Very pleased!",1
Heartbreaking True Story: This is a beautifully written story from the heart. The author tells about going through a life altering experience and what it is like to come out on the other side. This was a local event that was highly publicized. It is like reading someone's private diary. This is a courageous man who shows that forgiveness is the only way you can move forward with a tragic event such as this. God Bless.,1
"This film is boring and insipid!: Maybe I'm not as articulate as the usual film critic, or self-indulgent for that matter, but after viewing 'Round Midnight I thought it proper to tell the persons in the jazz populace not watch the film! That is,unless you want to over-serenaded with ballads and blues oriented chord progressions! Francis' obsession with Dale Turner is what one might call ""icky"". Dale Turner himself, is a garbling fool whose speech patterns simply annoy the viewer. The friendship that the Parisian and the ailing be-bop musician form is anything but inspiring. It is riddled with montages and various rescue missions. That is, Francis coming to the aid of Dale, drunk in the alley, thrown in the police wagon, captured at the hospital. Francis, get a life. Oh well, jazzers send me your hate mail, tell me how I don't understand the deep deep beauty and ambience of the film-please, I'm waiting!",0

"Infatuation With Malevolence: This is where it started with Dying Fetus. This album consists of the ""Bathe in Entrails"" and ""Infatuation with Malevolence"" demos.

"This book changed my view on life!: Even if you're not a Rollins or a Black Flag fan, you've gotta read this book. It makes you think how people can treat other just for doing what they love, playing music that moves people. Rollins puts a perspective on life like no other. This book will move you as well as entertain. It's is in my top 5 of best books I've ever read. Hank tells, like no other!",1

"Bummer: There is no manual included, no disk either. I've been struggling with one problem after another trying to get a connection, each time I solve one problem another pops up.

"Cooks great eggs; unit poor quality: I had a love-hate relationship with my egg cooker. Loved the way it cooked eggs but it was very difficult to clean. The poaching tray was terrible as it was impossible to clean. Supposedly it is teflon but it is not. I don't know what it is, I just know it's not teflon and egg sticks horribly even with butter. The inside aluminum tray for boiled eggs is difficult to clean and the paint or coating on the base unit started flaking off into the eggs. I used it frequently for about 3 years and threw away the poaching tray. The only way to actually clean it is to put straight vinegar in the base and let it run a cooking cycle. But then your house stinks of vinegar.Bottom line - great design, very poor materials.",0
"Permanent is not a compilation worth purchasing.: What were the manufacturers of this compilation attempting to do besides make more money. The songs chosen here all good but then again every song Joy Division made was good. This compilation takes a couple of tracks from both studio albums and throws in several non lp singles. The songs which were chosen do not begin to show the range and overall greatness of the band. This was the first ablum that I bought by Joy Division and it was so dreary that I almost gave up on the band. I did buy the much better compilation ""Substance"" which is a much better representation of the band's music. After listening Substance I decided I had to buy the box set Heart and Soul which is wonderful. ASo if you decide to purchase a joy division album please do not start with Permanent. Almost any other title is a better starting point for a fna than is Permanent.",0

"From Sari: My ex boyfriend used to adapt a quote from the old movie LOVE STORY when he would joke and say 'Love means always having to say Sari' I hope this translates so you understand. Well, now he's really Sari as in sorry because he broke my heart into tiny pieces small as rice. I saw this book in Japanese several months ago and never thought I'd need it, but found it in the US also. I think the authors are american because the publisher is american so what is interesting is that their ideas to help heal a broken heart work anywhere in the world. So I write this to say Domi Arigato. Thank you so much for this helpful book.Regards from Sari.",1
"Greta Scacchi's character: I agree with the Amazon.com reviewer, but the subject of my comment is something else:Interesting that so many pepole assume that Victoria is Frederick Pope's mistress. I figured she was his wife. After all, she did inherit the estate.It's unfortunate that people think that sex can't possibly be that good unless it's illicit.(Not that I believe that sex between unmarried partners is illicit-- but marriage gives sex a stamp of propriety, at least in our society.)",0

"Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",0
Limited usefulness: This book and document holder has limited usefulness for both. The height adjustment does not stay up on its own very well and it cannot hold a document over 6 inches in height unless extended. Magazines and periodicals of any thickness will not do very well since it will not support their weight. Since the top clip is only good for something up to 1/2 inch thick and the bottom does not retain well it has limited usefulness for books of any thickness or binding stiffness. The stand does not snap into place so any disturbance will likely cause it to collapse. Pass on this one. I wish I had.,0
"big pants: I had thought these would be similar in fit with the pull on pants but with tabs. How wrong was I. I am a small size and can't get these to fit properly, they are huge. The tabs come undone also(when they re pulled tight. I am sorry I bought a case, what a waste of money.",0
"The World's Greatest Music: This cd is an awesome cd because it combines all of Madonna's greatest hits. Anyone that is a fan of Madonna is sure to love this cd! Also for anyone that has never listened to any of Madonna's music, this would be a great choice because it offers many great titles that explore her career. It's great when a cd combines songs that have been popular that everyone loves because instead of having many cds you can just pop in one. If someone wanted a cd to explain the past decade or so, this would be it. Madonna has been a public icon for so long and throughout our changing times Madonna has reinvented herself to provide amazing music. The music that Madonna has created can express any emotion and is sure to put a smile on your face!",1
"The 2001 printing of this book is five stars all the way!: The 2001 printing is stunning - glossy paper, beautiful photographs, and Sharyn Craig's usual excellent material.The 2009 printing is something called a ""Print on Demand"" and the quality is atrocious. It is made out of flat paper which makes the photographs dull, lacking contrast, and quite plainly AWFUL.C&T; should be ashamed to put out a product like this and Amazon should be ashamed that they sold it without notifying the consumer that it was a print on demand substandard product.",0
"Be prepared to hate your life: I have been using XBOX Live for 11 months. Online play usually works, but often lags and drops. I do not have similar problems on comparable PC games, so I doubt this is an issue with MY ISP. Since games are usually hosted by other XBOXs, your results will vary with every session. I recently tried using a friend's console with my profile. I had to enter all my information twice because it timed out... not that big a deal. However, when I got home I was prompted to recover my profile online. So I entered my info... timed out. I entered it again... timed out.

Terrible.: No wonder the author got this book out so soon after Enron's fall. He filled the book with the work of others and then threw in old essays on the failures of capitalism that have no connection to the Enron scandal. Don' waste your money on this book.,0
"The way I look at it: The way I look at it is, my own life I mean I'm 14 and my life is almost exactly like that book. I have 2 best friends that are like sisters to me and they would do anything for me, I've dated a total geek, and my mom is in love with T.V. This book is the best book ever, I mean I couldn't even put it down when I started to read it. It's about this girl named sophi (fifi) who is going through some real hard times with boys, friends, her mom, and the internet. It was written in poem form, which I love. I think anybody over the age of 11 should read this book because it talks about more teenage things than childish things.Signed,Lacie",1
"Best Clippers Ever: I normally don't comment on my purchases but I was so impressed by these clippers I'm making an exception. I have been shaving my head for over 20 years and in that time I've gone through many clippers some cheap some not so cheap and these clipper blow everyone one of them away. Normally it would take me 30 to 40 minutes to cut my hair and beard then shave the remaining stubble but with these clippers I was done in 10 minutes. They are so pleasant to use no pulled hairs, no going over the same area many times and the best thing no loud buzzing motor just a nice gental hum. It was a little bit hard to swallow the price tag but after using them I would have paid even more there just that good. The build quality is excellent you can really feel that these will last a very long time.",1

Great musical trip: A great video of a musical Good Will trip. The orchestra was just fantastic. The Korean folk song Airiang played by a full orchestra brought tears to my eyes.,1
"Awesome song!: This is in my opinion, one of U2's greatest love songs they've ever done.It's so hard to believe that this song is actually over 12 years old because it shows none of it's age even in 2004. This is a really deep, creative, and angst-ridden rock song with Bono's incredible vocals and amazing lyrics.The album ""Achtung Baby"" is a must-have because it's the most innovative rock album of the 1990s and should be bought but this single is worth getting too just for the B-Sides which unforuntately weren't on the 1990-2000 collection due to the labels bumbling management of it's conception.This is one of U2's greatest songs of the 1990s and still is popular today and that's saying a lot!",1
Fun movie!: This is a fun movie where you can just lose yourself and enjoy the ride. A lot of funny parts throughout too.,1
super easy review of kirekegaard: Well developed synopsis of the most important contributions from Kirkegaard. Only the very top of the iceberg has been touched in this book however. The idea of making it a comic book does not add anything. It confuses and is not funny. The book misspells two important Danish words.,0
"Simply Bad!: This is simply a bad book. It contains almost nothing but the author's tall tales, and very little concrete information or advice.

"Please enter a title for your review: After finding the first two seasons thoroughly engaging I was surprised to find the the writing take a dramatic downturn on this third season with the characters becoming more one dimensional and the overall outlook becoming more cheesy and sanctimonious than Touched By An Angel. Plot devices were continuously recycled, oppresive governments, corrupt military officers/scientists/corporate execs, Quinn's damsels in distress and white knight act, the sliders constantly being surprised by how things in each new world aren't what they appear and taking the long way to figure out something that is easily apparent to the viewer. In addition to creativity being traded in for formulas certain episodes shamelessly rip off the creatures from the film Tremors and an X-Files episode where a noisy generator motor powers a light keeping creatures at bay.",0
"A difinitive look at The Prince of Soul: As a fellow author on soul music and as something of a historian on Motown and its artists, I thought I knew everything there was to know about Marvin Gaye. Mr. Turner's book quickly proved me wrong. Trouble Man turned out to be a difinitive look at one of the most talented, and obviously one of the most troubled artists in the history of modern popular music. Drawing on exhaustive research (particularly about Gaye's father) and utilizing first hand interviews (most notably with Gaye's second wife, Jan), Turner crafts a tome that has you coming away from the book with a clearer understanding of what made Marvin tick. Although not quite as in-depth as Divided Soul, Trouble Man moves quickly, and is entertaining without being scandalous. This is a must-read for all Marvin Gaye fans.",1
"Don't bother: Couldn't last past 1st chapter! Found it ditzy,, no real story. If a novel hasn't got me in during the first few pages, it's not worth it. This was one such novel. Unimpressed. Won't be searching out this authors work.",0

"The Ultimate Authority on Cake: Like other reviewers, I no longer use cake mixes because this cookbook's recipes are so superb. Perhaps it's not the best cookbook to give somebody with little baking experience, but if you *care* about your cake, this book is the last word.I have never had a recipe from this book fail. I've made two wedding cakes from it with no special skills or experience besides my iron determination. Beranbaum's idea of sweets, however, is sometimes more ""sophisticated"" than what people are used to. For example, I made the flourless chocolate cake for a family gathering. It was seriously awesome (my grandma and I gorged on it until we could eat no more) but it remained largely untouched by the rest of my family, whose idea of awesome cake is the sheet cake covered in crisco roses that you get at the grocery store.",1
"One of 10 I would bring to the desert island....: Train catches the essential Earle. Great musicians on this album. Fantastic stories, good music, wonderful ""comback"" compilation of old and new. I was priviliged to see SE in his first live show after getting out of the grey bar hotel at the Vic in Chicago. Still the best show I have ever seen. He was truely moved on several occasions and once had to turn his back to the crowd because of it. I have been to dozens of shows in my day but never experieced a show where they turned on the lights to the theater and turned on the recorded music, and nobody left. SE came on for a 4th encore and said "" I don't know where your staying tonight but it can't be here, so I'll do one more and you got to promise to go"". Well he went into a acoustic version of Someday and made everyones night. What a great album and eclectic talent.",1
"Warning about galvanized metal: Hi. I just wanted to warn dog owners about the danger of using galvanized metal for feeding or watering their dog. Galvanized metal has a coating of zinc which will leach into the water at a toxic level. Probably should also bypass the plastic waterer since they also leach pthalates and coloring into the water, especially if the waterer will be exposed to sunlight. Your dog deserves fresh, pure water so please buy the stainless steel automatic dog waterer. Toxins in the water may not make your dog acutely sick, but will degrade his/her health over time. sp",0

"Have a pencil handy when reading the 100th anniversary edition: I bought the ""special, 100th anniversary"" edition of this book I had never read (though I thoroughly enjoy the television adaptation starring Megan Fallows). Montgomery's writing is wonderful. Unfortunately, this edition is marred by many typographical errors. Most that I have encountered so far (I have only read about a fourth of the book as of this morning) seem to substitute ""n"" for ""r"" -- producing ""on"" when ""or"" is intended, ""oven"" for ""over,"" etc. By far the most jarring is seeing Marilla rendered ""Mania"" -- including twice within two pages. It's a shame that the publishers can't do better when putting out what purports to be a ""special"" edition of this classic.",0
"Stooges protest Columbia: I have not seen the DVD yet, but am quite perturbed that Columbia has been so slow to put out all the stooges on DVD. First we got 7 episodes, then 6 and then 5. Now, they are giving us 4 with two of them already in previous DVDs. Lets all protest Columbia so that they will get back to their senses and finish the first job which is to release the rest of the episodes as they started. Then they can do what they want with colorization, etc. I wrote them 3 letters in the past and they never responded. Anyone that can break through to them, I encourage you to do so. I feel better, now.",0
outrageous price: this item almost doubled in price in a couple of weeks. Are they nuts! They can keep it,0
Best Book on the Subject: I've had alot of conscious out-of-body experiences in my life and read many books on the subject. This book really hit the nail on the head! The most detailed and accurate book on the subject with lots of exercises that really work! I recommend it highly!,1
"As Stupid As They Come: This book is a waste of time and money. The advice is awful and not realistic. Women want men with style, cash, and some degree of looks. This will only make you look weak, desperate, and pathetic.",0
Insul knife: After years of cutting insulation with a utility knife I have to say this product is wonderful. This knife is a great time saver. Try it and you will see.HOWEVER---I was not satisfied with how sharp the blade was.I sent it to a sharpening shop to put a proper edge on it.That's all.,1
"I got fooled!: The Bear's guide used to be an excellent resource. Now, it's been watered down into a series of books rather than all the needed info in one book, I presume to make obscene amounts of money. So, save yours! There's better info online, and it's free!",0

"dissapointed: the worst of judas priest. the singer lacks everything including his own personality.the 5star reviews must be from teenagers that never grasped the true talent of judas priest. the intro to every song is draw out but the rifs are quit good to say the most. they will never be judas priest again untill halford comes back.the music would be a little better if they dumped the punk ""ripper""(please) owens.",0
"Very Good Distribution, But......: I have been using Linux in one form or another for almost ten years. First was Red Hat 5.2 back in 1996 so I have been around Linux for long enough to know what a distribution is supposed to be like. This one is VERY good with one exception which is not their fault and that is....no DVD playback! The video player will not work and cannot be made to work, even with a decryption download that is available. The YaST installer won't even install it! I am not advocating illegal actions such as copying and distributing pirated DVD's, I only want to watch the ones I have so I have to dual boot with windows if I want to watch DVD's on my computer.The version I have been using is the free version from opensuse.org (if you can get the bandwidth to download 5 CD's worth).",1
"Blurry Pictures, bad battery management: This is probably the worst camera I have had or seen. The picture quality is horrible, most of picture I shot would have the blurriness indicator (red palm); it wasnt just the picture would be blur, but i would be all dark. I can understand a camera might drain pretty fast, but this camera take too long to power up even when battery is fully charged(I would have to open the battery cover and push the battery in to get the camera to power up).",0
"Weeds jumped the shark!: Season seven appears to have fallen victim to age. Seasons one through six appeared excellent at first then dropping to very good and then falling off a cliff with season seven.Season seven picks up three years after the conclusion of season six with Nancy leaving prison. That, aparently, is where the writer(s) must have experienced a major breakdown in creativity.Before season seven one could enjoy the experience of spreading out watching each week over time. However, with season seven, one finds it necessary to watch the entire season in one sitting, just to get it over with. You might hope for some salvation of Weeds but, nothing really saved season seven.Still great acting and the presentation showed slight creativity but, with such poor screen writing all that is left is disappointment.",0
"dont like it: This stuff leaves streaks on my windshield after I use my wiper blades, reducing visibility.",0
"awesome!!!!!: I almost died when I found ""Know Your Role"" in the video store. I've probably watched it three-hundred times, and i never get bored with it. The Rock rules in the WWF!",1
"Flexible hose nozzle: This hose nozzle functions as claimed. It's operation is very smooth, and the water flow is extremely flexible, varying from stream to soaker function. The ergonomics allow for comfortable handling, even for prolonged periods. Additionally, the shut off is effective, with no dripping when turned to the off position (reached by rotating in either direction). In summary, a very effective product which is well worth the price.",1
"I should be a right wing propagandist, they'll buy anything: Yet another skewed accounting. Rife with out of context ""facts"" and pure speculation. $20M in revenue? Really? I need to join the right wing conspiracy squad and put out my own rehash of this drivel. And I have a bridge for sale too. This wasn't worth the time it took to watch. I kept hoping that it would go somewhere but was disappointed. Not surprised though.",0
"great for beginners, but too few references: This is a great introductory book. Beautifully edited, very well written, with a lot of information to start digging each subject; I just missed a few more references in each chapter, and also more references to journals and not just other books, and then I would have been a 5 star.",1
"Horrible product!!!: I bought Br. Bronner'castile soap in 3 scents.After started using it,my skin became itchy and dull looking.Before using Dr. Bronner,we were using a different brand,just as healthy but in a bar.On top of my skin issues,I had to scrub my tub after each shower due to the awful residue that this soap was leaving.So,I decided to put it away until a few days ago when I found a dish liquid recipe calling for this soap.I made the soap and all I can say is that again this thing is awful.My dishes and my sink have the same residue as the tub.Love the lavender scent and the fact that is pretty natural,but that's about it.",0
"Good for belts and wristlets: I bought this to replace an old belt/tie rack that had seen better days. I am a female and dont wear ties, so mine holds belts, small umbrellas and wristlets, and it works great. I wish i could have gotten it for the 7.00 its listed at now but its cool.. i still like it",1
"Art:21: Art in the 21st Century (Season 3): I was amazed that these artists made it to a show on television. The work was boarderline awful. The only interesting artist was the glass artist, I thought his work was well done. Most of the other artists were on a par with elementary school children, young elemtary school children. One artist went to the dollar store to buy colored plastic containers to hammer onto her art. Yuck!",0
"Don't bother / Ni te molestes.: The only worthwhile items on this CD are numbers 8, 9, and 11. The rest is an amalgamam of depressing songs, mostly ""pregones"", making it the primal reason this compilation stinks, as Puerto Rican music is usually very upbeat and full of life. I have a feeling that whomever decided on most of these particular songs had a hidden political agenda, as the lyrics have an ""independentista"" double entendre to them.I should have suspected, since the album contains two numbers with Andr√©s ""El J√≠baro"" J√≠menez, a once-promising artist who got too high on his political horse. I guess he must think of himself as the Puerto Rican equivalent of Silvio Rodr√≠guez, ""y realmente no le llega ni a los talones"".Don't waste your money, that is, unless you're into the ""blame the Yankee for every problem in Puerto Rico"" mindset.Oh, and one more thing: ""¬°Ni siquiera es bailable!"" Now, isn't that proof enough that it's not an album representative of Puerto Rican music?",0
"even a girl can like tough books...don't forget about us: i think it is dissapointing to hear people complain about how this book isn't as good as the movie. in fact, perhaps it would have been better if i hadn't seen the movie first because the originial ideas of Chuck Palahniuk are the WORDS, not brad pitt or edward norton. if anything, this book proves it's point to you if you thought is was worse than the movie: 1. you like things 2. you like to buy things 3. you want things 4. you need society 5. ""you're the faker."" this book deserves more recognition than any movie screen can offer, unfortunately somewhere between birth and our ""20-something"" lifestyles, we forget to read. i don't deny how much i'd like to take a peice of brad pitt and take him home with me, but he is not the brain nor the words of the original inducer. Chuck Palahniuk isn't the common house name brand. and brad pitt is? how ironic, chuck.",1
"Good, but not as good as the previous books in the series: I just reread this after rereading the other two books in the series. This was still very good, but I didn't like it quite as much as the first two books. I thought it dragged in places despite being a short book, and I wasn't terribly satisfied with the ending.However, it's still very good, and obviously a must read if you already read the previous books.",1
"*SQUISH* Just Like Grape: There's a scene inThe Karate Kidin which Pat Morita talks to Ralph Macchio about walking on the road; walk on either side, you're okay, but if you walk in the middle, you're going to get squished just like a grape. This movie is that grape.If it was trying to be funny, it wasn't and if it was trying to be dramatic, it wasn't. It seemed to be trying to do both and ended up failing at both. Bit of advice to the writer, paraphrased fromDead Again: find out which one you want it to be and make it that way.",0
One of the worst: It is impossible to understand how a prof can choose this book. I am an grad student and forced to buy this book. This book contains no useful engineering applications whatsoever. It is very confusing and hard to follow. I had to purchase two other thermo books to finally understand what was going on. End of chapter problems are very hard and not enough sample problems. I have too much negative things to say about this book than positive.,0
"Superficial but somewhat interesting: The first section of the book that describes types of toxic people is interesting. The section that tells you how to deal with each type of toxic personality is also somewhat interesting, if incredibly obvious.The section that lists 'toxic faults' is ridiculous. One would have to be a perfect person, both in terms of looks and personality, in order to be found acceptable by the author. I understand that she focuses on outward appearances because of 'first impressions', but she takes it to such an extreme, I suspect she has some issues with her own looks.",0
"Works Great - A little Slow: This shredder works well. It chips (cross cut) the paper so I have a much more secure feeling than I did with the my old standard shredder. The only minor drawback so far is that it takes slightly longer to chip the paper. That being said, I haven't had any problems with jamming even with credit cards or cardboard weight paper. The unit is nice and compact yet it holds a fair amount. The top shredding unit is a little heavy/clumsy so it maybe difficult for someone who is frail to handle emptying the unit easily. It is great for home use.",1
XSLT Book - it's not worth it: I would not recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn XSLT. The code examples are hard to understand and the writing rambles. It would be just as easy to read the w3c spec.,0
A great album: This album is truly a great album. Released in 2005 internationally it is still rocking in 2008. All the songs are good most are great I recommend it highly I have already ordered their 2007 album can't wait to hear that I read the reviews some people say it's too commercial not as good as this one but look how much time they had to perfect this one. They did a superb job.,1
"Mostly an advertisement; poorly written.: Mostly an advertisement for the author's CrainioSacral therapy, this book is poorly written and full of crude hand-drawn figures.",0
Great gift: Who doesn't remember Benny Hill?It is nice that you can buy just the years of Benny Hill you want.I picked the years that pertained to what the gift recepient remembers....Perfect gift idea!,1
"Laugh out loud funny, pre Ally McBeal - and so much better: This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. (I laughed out loud reading it in public). It's a mix of very smart wit with cringing (but still very funny) reality. I know her, I used to be her! Much more fun than Ally McBoring, even to a ""smug married"" like me.",1
"Fortunately, it was a Kindle freebie: You shouldn't be able to guess well before the end who the bad guy is, but it's glaringly obvious--well, except to our heroine, Dr. Morgan Snow, who's not the brightest. Actually, she can be super smart when it serves the plot and super stupid for the same reason.",0
"I don't believe a boycot is in order.: Though I agree that Collective Soul isn't the same band as they were in 1995, but hey, who says that's a bad thing? I loved Collective Soul then and I love them now! Five years does a lot to band as it would a sports team or anything for that matter. That's musical evolution, not selling out. Not writing what will sell, but writing what will be listened to. If it sells that means that it is what the majority of the people want to hear. Isn't that the point of being a musical icon? Blender is a good example of Collective Soul's evolution over the past five years. I would recommend it to any true music lover along with fans of alternative and rock.",1
Thule Canoe Carrier: Easily installs to the Thule roof mount system. I used it to carry a 19ft stripper that weighs in about 50 pounds. Three hundred miles and it didn't shift or loosen. This carrier is aces and comes with all the tie downs for bow and stern. Good value for the money.,1
"You're Kidding, Right?: I got these headphones for an overseas trip with hopes that they would cancel out most of the noise on the plane and allow me to clearly hear music. The noise cancelling is a joke. My non-noise cancelling Audio Technica M50's (incredible headphones) do more or equal noise cancelling just from their ear cups. On these Philips headphones there is really no ""Active"" noise cancelling as the product states. They really rely on passive noise cancelling, which is FAR from that of Bose or its decent competitors, which this is not.At $50 they make a decent pair of standard headphones, which is what they are, but you could definitely find something better for the same price. I have to say, these are a disappointment after hearing Bose's QC15 and thinking that these would even come close.",0
"Snare Straps: Strong, flexible straps for attaching snare spring assembly to your snare drum. Should last a very long time if not over-tightened.",1
"A great guide!: These cards are a small reminder of Linda Goodman's Star Signs. It is a great aid to assisting you in reconnecting to the basis of natural laws, they just use different names - ie Mercury, Venus, etc. I have used other numerology but this one fits right in with so many things. Take for instance the WTC attack. This happened on the 11th day and if you read what the number means you will see that this world's energy runs on an orderly method and these cards hit close to home. Remember that these cards like anything else we humans use can be abused. They are an aid, a guide and as being human, the road our destiny takes is really our final choice, and these cards assist us to make spiritual choices based on an ancient knowledge that is being remembered.",1
"Excelente Compilaci√≥n de lo mejor de Caifanes: Debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que Caifanes NO es lo mismo que Jaguares. Son dos grupos diferentes ya que en Caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. El unico pero que le pongo a este CD es que solo incluyeron 2 canciones del MTV Unplugged. Me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el MTV unplugged en el segundo disco. Las guitarras de Marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (Regrabaciones). Un buen disco para empezar. Estoy seguro que si este es el primer disco de Caifanes que se adquiere pronto nacera la curiosidad por conocer las canciones que no se incluyen de los otros discos.",1
"Excellent read: informative, sad and chilling: This book was exceptionally well written and well researched, giving a very detailed account of how violence in the African American community, and primarily in the Bosket family, got its start from the violence that was the norm in South Carolina, where the Boskets came from. The story of Willie's family, his ancestors all the way up to his parents and siblings, is a sobering one that explains how families can be ""doomed"" when they remain outside of the mainstream and do not have access to opportunity or given any hope. Butterfield does a good job describing the criminal justice system as it relates to children and how we have come to treat 12 and 13 year old children like adults. But what is being done to stop this madness?",1
"Excellent Debut Album: I've listened to this CD over and over and it gets better every time. My favorites keep changing every day. Today I woke up humming ""Perfect Day"". Yesterday, it was ""The Way"". My tastes in music cover a wide range and I don't expect Clay to cover them all. So if you only like hip-hop, rap or hard rock you won't like it. But if you like listening to a beautiful passionate voice sing love songs, pop ballads and light rock this is a must buy.",1
"ok, not great: I've decided to stop running the Nevegals. They wear out way too fast (5 good rides and the knobs are about gone), plus i have had a couple of them bulge out on me.Time to try Maxxis out, I've heard great reviews about them!",0
Rugged!: Winteriziing your RV can be a challenge at times depending on HOW you do it.I find it best to open all of the valves and blow all of the lines out. I still use a little antifreeze as a precaution.,1
"Magical!: It genuinely is a shame that the quality of this hilarious series had to die away over time, especially considering all of the happy, fond memories I have of watching these older episodes years ago. Albeit I detest the deterioration of quality found in the newer episodes, which feel more rushed and lack the charm that the older episodes once had, the beginning seasons were much more hysterical and enjoyable. Now I try to avoid watching the more recent SpongeBob SquarePants episodes because just knowing that the earlier episodes were better kills their quality even more for me. If you want to buy some SpongeBob SquarePants episodes for your entertainment, you seriously should get the earlier seasons, seasons filled with nice memories of the good television cartoons available before the quality drop that is seen in children's programs nowadays.",1
Locked Out: We have been trying to find out how to unlock the system. We can do anything. Can someone help us. We do not know if we pushed the wrong button or not. It looks like something is in the drive to record the cds. Another cd can not go into it.Please can someone shade some light on this.Thanks,1
"Bugsy a disapointment: I was disappointed by this DVD. Watching it, I got bored and just went on to other things. Sort of bothered by an apparent glorification of someone who really wasn't a very nice person.",0
"The product is good, but the company and customer service is horrible.: I bought this product on their company site along with a subscription to the litter trays. Our cat died a few months later and I needed to cancel the subscription.I sent an email one day asking to cancel my account and didn't get a response back from them - ever. A few weeks after I sent the email I had to call the number and get someone to cancel the account. They then notified me that I'd be charged a $20 cancellation fee because I had not bought enough of the trays (apparently I got some promotional rate that had this ""fine print"" that said I was getting a promo rate).The guy I talked to on the phone was completely rude and could not have cared less about the situation. He told me there would be a charge on my card and that was it.Even though the product worked as advertised, I wouldn't suggest buying anything from a company like ScoopFree.",0
"Awesome Compilation of Ray's Work: I'm not a big fan of soundtracks in the least bit, but this is one that I spared the out of pocket money for. I really enjoy this showcase of Ray Charles' work. My favorites will always remain ""Uncain my heart"" ""What'd I say"" and ""Marianne."" I would reccomend this for any Ray fan, even those who despise soundtracks.",1
"Bottom Line huge disappointment: There should be a WARNING with this CD of the horrid audience NOISE that interfers with her singing. And the applause is way over the top, hooting and whistling makes the cd hard to listen to. I am hugely disappointed.",0
"A really funny read!: Bill Bryson combines humor and adventure, this book will leave you feeling like the appalachian trial is magnificant and horrible to climb- his experiences are easily read and charming.",1
"It actually depressed me.: Not what I normally look for from a romance novel, obviously.Having known women that really believe their men (fathers, boyfriends, husbands) treat them like crap 'to protect them' or 'for their own good' this book was like an insight into their lives.A woman who blames herself or makes excuses for the emotional abuse that is heaped on her is just sad... sad, sad, sad. Don't we see enough of this in the real world?And can I just say that the very idea that women hold their power on their knees (as Hannah does midway through the book) is BEYOND INSULTING! A womans' power comes from her intellect and strength not her suction level.If you want something that doesn't subjugate and marginalize a woman, Hustler magazine is a better bet.",0
"Flat and undeveloped: I rated this book as low as I did simply because I lost interest less than a quarter of the way into it. Maybe it came later but Lawrence Block created no depth to the newlyweds or their relationship leaving me with no real connection to them except for maybe a lack of sympathy. Block casually grazes through the murder of the cabin resident next door and the non-chalant rape of the bride by mobster-types who disappear with apparently no concern of leaving behind the newlyweds as eyewitnesses. Then it's just sort've understood that the newlyweds will seek revenge yet there is hardly any dialogue about it. For those who read on, I hope that for your sake it gets better.",0
"Not Happy: Not happy at all with this product, I expected more from CISCO. It is not possible to use this camera for outside viewing unless it is in low light conditions. The motion detection is very unreliable, works maybe 50% of the time. The camera runs extremely warm (no ventilation) and needs bounced often. It is on its way back to Amazon soon. This camera is not ready for the market, I rate it a do not buy!",0
"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]: An absolutely awesome movie! It's your typical 90's movie. A great storyline, lots of action, comedy, and plenty of wonderful cheesiness! This is a can't miss movie full of everything from action to comedy to drama and so on. Defiantly worth watching!",1
"A landmark in Mahler discography: The sound on this Telarc recording is brilliantly clear and yet warmly atmospheric. The interpretation pays close attention to Mahler's markings in the score and achieves a level of transparency and faithfulness to the densely polyphonic structure that can only be marvelled at.Zander's brilliantly instructive comments on the score contained on the accompanying CD alone justify the price of this recording. I found his description greatly enhanced my appreciation of this symphony, especially the 'difficult' second and third movements and their relation to the whole.This CD sets a new benchmark for recordings of Mahler's ninth.Congratulations to all involved.",1
"Works fine, as described: This home phone does exactly as described. I thought I would have to keep my cell phone closer to the unit, but I keep it up to 15 feet away with out hearing crackling. I have had it for 2 weeks, and I am still trying to figure out all the features. I do like that you can download your own ringtones, but it can only be MIDI files under 10K.As far as the review complaining on the soft reset, I did see that happen one time on the second day I had the phone, but not since ... and I did not put batteries into the bsae until the second week.My wife and I are on Cingular, as well as some friends. This unit allows her to anwser her cell phone from this phone instead of running around the house looking for the cell phone in time. Also, it acts as a 2nd line. Just put your home line on hold and use the cell line to dial someone else.I would feel confident in referring this unit to a friend or family that needs this feature.",1
Not what they advertised: They said it was a Boston Shaker and it is not. Just a regular cocktail shaker. They did pay for the return.,0
"No problems: The downrod arrived in good shape, however the product managed to poke through the box. Our mailman asked us to check it before he left to make sure the product was OK. Otherwise, it's installed and fine.",1
"more ""and other battles"" than combat: This book has polarized more readers than it should. As an active-duty officer, I can tell you that the military experience varies across services, ranks, duy stations, and individuals. Judging from the book, Swofford was one of the bottom 10% guys that drags down the military. Herein lies the only real value of the work--it proves a decent case study of a leadership challenge. Many junior enlisted service members enter the military with the same emotional baggage that Swofford did. Most cope well, but some don't. Jarhead is subtitled ""and other battles"" for a reason: the Gulf War ""combat"" plays a minor role in the text. Is Swofford representative of the vast majority of service members? No. Does he take liberties with the truth? Probably. Would I take his writing seminar? Hell no. This book will be quickly forgotten, but it's worth borrowing for a quick read.",0
Night Ranger: Is is the first Night Ranger C.D I have brought for 17 Years since Big Life. Not a bad album the best track on their is seven wishes. The album is far better than Big Life a with a lot rock .,1
"Good for building, but not playing with: If your child likes building things they will love this. Very fun to put together - you can build three different dinosaurs, but you can also use your imagination to make your own creations. My son loved building these. Only problem is that you can't really play with them after they are built because they tend to fall apart with light play. So once you make there's not much else to do with them.",1
"poor product: it does its job, but it looks cheap and poor finish , has a lot of noise and any electrical device can interfere with it",0
"2 stars - for only 2 songs: 2 stars for 2 songs: ""Summer breezin"" and ""sugar sugar"" are really convincing and quite up to the level of her first hit ""shy guy"". The rest of the album is ok, but not very spectacular and rather boring to my ears.",0
Kindle: I originally purchaed the first kindle and now have the second kindle. What a difference and much lighter in weight and touch keys are much nicer. How unfair that the first one cost me $300.00 and now you can purchase for $189.00. Amazon should offer customers some form of credit for future purchases on books or accessories for their kindles.,1
"poor product support: Purchased and set it up with out any issues. It worked for 5 months then it broke. Verified with Microsoft that it was indeed dead and could not be fixed. They only offer a 90-day warranty on this which shows how flaky it is if Microsoft won't warranty it the standard year all electronic products get. They also mentioned it was discontinued so even if it broke within 90-days from purchase, they don't have replacements to give out.I looked online to see what can be done to fix this and it seems there is a fuse that frequently burns out and can only be replaced by taking it apart and soldering a new one back on. $20 down the drain and now I have to buy another one.",0
"Not a good sax stand.: This stand does not hold properly the alto or tenor sax and it is not possible to adjust the bell holder, the bari holder does not protect the front bell as it does't has a cushion in that area and it has contact that with the time will tarnish or damage the instrument laquer, good price but not very protective...",0
buyer beware!: I ordered this recently as a holiday gift. I was extremely disappointed when I received the item from seller Lucca. It arrived in a USPS shoe box wrapped in newspaper. The description (which has since been changed) said it came in a gift box and many of the reviewers prior to my order mentioned that the packaging was cute and made for a nice gift. I have contacted the seller twice and have not received a reply.,0
"I must have gotten a dud...: I bought this camera a few days ago and none of the pictures that I have taken have come out right. The LCD screen appears dark and blurry. 95% of the pictures that I have taken have come out blurry. The color quality is dull, not what I usually see with Kodak cameras. The software is useless. A friend on mine owns the Kodak DX7440 (which is the exact same camera but 4 megs instead of 5) takes beautiful pictures with vibrant colors.",0
"Customer Service SUCKS!: While I have my projector for 5 months, it stopped working and upon servicing it, Optoma returned it stating I needed to purchase a new lamp. The customer service representative said that it was my bad luck of the draw and there was nothing I could do but buy a new lamp on my own dime....go figure, great support. I will never buy from them again.",0
Poorly assembled: This was a Christmas present for my 5 year old son and while he loves it he can not skate more than a foot without veering off to the right. The wheels were put on crooked. I think this is a great product but the assembly line needs to be reviewed and improved.,0
"Kind of a waste of money.: I found that you can do the same thing online through TurboTax as you can with the software...and with the software, you still have to pay to file the paperwork online. They led me to believe that it was free filing.",0
"great pop punk: Fenix tx may be viewed as ""sell outs"" but they are a good punk band. Yes, they do sound like blink and are on mtv and I even got an email asking me to vote for them on trl, but they still sound good. They are also one of the best live bands out there. check out new found glory, millencolin and midtown if you like this kind of music.",1
"Give me a break.....: You know, as I was reading the customer reviews, one thing struck me. Not one review was helpful. Sure, ""KoRn rocks"" and ""this is the best CD ever"" can mean something to a 5 year old but to the music buying public, it just doesn't cut it. That's not to say that this album is in any way bad (because I think it's great). It's just that the reviews haven't told of the repitition in KoRn's music (how many times do we need Johnathan Davis to tell us he ""feels like god""?). But if you are a fan of the new metal (like KoRn, Limp Bizkit and Rage), then by all means, this is a great album to buy. Because I said so.",1
"Oh...My.....God!!!!: I saw this group play live at the Sundance Film Festival along with BT and Moby, and i was blown away. I have never in my life heard any other music like this before, ambient/tribal/dance/techno with a lump of classical and opera thrown in just for the fun of it....and then....BOOOOOOM!!!!! it all suddenly kicks in .....and works man!. KEEP IT COMING FLIPPER!!!!!",1
"A Spirit roams the stars...: For the opening book in a series (as I understand it), ""Warrior Brothers"", is essentially the story of the Brothers finding each other and first adventures.What happens when galactic cultures introduce? Is the great Spirit that guides our Native world the same that directs other native worlds? Can personal courage and a man with primitive weapons play on the same stage with interstellar fleets and ancient science...and make a difference? Moral complexity intrudes, trust and faith are tested, much happens and ""Warrior Brothers"" is an epic well begun.I enjoyed this very much, and am looking forward to the sequel. Thank you, Mr Bainbridge. Thank you very much, indeed.",1
"Deeply Imaginative: Alan Campbell is another Brit with an endless imagination (why do they all come from Britain?) His story could've become bogged down in the world building -- after all, it is a city suspended above an abyss by chains.The story doesn't crumble, however. In fact, it truly takes flight (no pun intended) when Carnival, an angel with the heart of a demon, takes center stage.The plot itself, while important, is something about wine, and souls, it is the imagination of each scene that pushes this book forward. Poisoners, angels, mad angels, ancient machines of creation/destruction, assassins, chemical weapons, and of course a city suspended above an abyss.Ryan McFaddenAuthor ofWomen of the Apocalypse",1
"The Best of heart felt music- Garth Brooks: No FencesI wanted to know that the used CD I purchased would be in good condition and play well without any skips. I remember owning the Cassette of Garth Brooks and loving it, so when I got a gift card for my birthday I searched for the older Garth Brooks albums that I had loved before. I was very happy when the Garth Brooks CD arrived in the mail just seven days after I had ordered it and it had little to no scratches and played well with no skips. I loved hearing the older Garth Brooks music that was original and heart felt. He has a lovely voice and writes such wonderful songs. Even though I am not religious, I still loved to hear ""Unanswered Prayers""! It really has a good message for all of us. Every song on ""No Fences"" was really great to hear again. I was completely happy with my purchase and spent very little money for a great product! Sincerely, Jesse Doty",1
"Excellent!: It is easy to see that this movie is low budget and that many of the ideas were borrowed. However, the message put forth and the quality of action are astounding. Personally I think the action sequences are a step up from the Matrix Reloaded because I'm not one for CGI. This is the real deal. The gun kata is an amazing concept. For anyone who has taken martial arts, they know a kata is an organized series of forms that could be used in a multiple attacker situation. The fact that guns are used in this type of form and you still remaining in a stationary position, you just have to see it. Then with the story, well, its a bit slow. The message is there though right in your face. This is definately a movie that will make you think and due to the low budget, a cult classic for this genre.",1
"Underpowered: Before buying a belt sander, I borrowed and friend's Bosch and rented one of these. I found the PC unit to be underpowered; when pressed on the work surface, it slows down considerably and gets hot quickly - the housing is too hot to touch! In contrast, the Bosch unit had significantly more power, making the job easier. I also disliked the PC's ergonomics - the bag sticks up between your hands and gets in the way when you're using the machine on a vertical surface. Buy a Bosch.",0
"this cd is excellent!: this cd combines the best of the best. It is the best of Easy E, Mack 10 and Ice Cube. It doesn't get much better than this.",1
"You just can't show ""style"" in black and white: See the 2 images above I uploaded. There are exactly 8 pages of color plates of women's dresses and a couple gentlemen's suits. One the color pages reproduces the front cover so it's a waste. The most divine picture is on the back cover: a close-up of one of the highly-decorated women's gowns. Black & white photographs simply cannot express the grandeur and eloquence of design. The Russian ""style"" is completely lost in it. There is page after page of folk dresses, paintings, portraits, art objects...blah blah...they're just boring. The text must take a second seat to the images and it cannot replace them.Jackie Kennedy Onassis was about as stylish as you can get. And this book was published in 1976 so she somehow got around the Iron Curtain (which is ironic regarding the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis). Unfortunately, this book has not stood the test of time. I can't recommend it.",0
"A Break from Barney!: My 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter absolutely love The Wiggles! I actually enjoy them, too! I bought the video because I felt we needed a break from Barney, and the kids now would rather watch The Wiggles! The music is very catchy, and the dances are adorable. My son's friends can't wait to dance when they come over!",1
GREAT MOVIE: This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen! The first 1 or 2 minutes of the movie is just great!,1
"A CD Of All Remakes!!!: I bought this CD for the song It's Too Late. Had I realized that the whole CD was all remakes I wouldn't have purchased it. Most of the arrangements are disappointing and not even as good as the originals. Although, I like a lot of Gloria's music this CD will be taken to the used CD shop my next trip. Don't waste your money on this one!!!",0
"I think it's the perfect blend for t.p.: I am pleased with the blend of the strength and softness for Seventh Generation toilet paper. I don't find it rough, and I tend to be a pamper-pleasure gal. My preference is to use a brand of toliet paper that doesn't leave little t.p. pills behind. Too soft of toilet paper does leave pills behind and that is horrible. I find the greatest difference in this aspect and am glad for Seventh Generations quality.",1
"An third-rate disaster from a master of mystery: I purchased this book at the airport, thinking that I was going to be reading another first-rate mystery by Ms. Cornwell. I diligently pursued the work, hoping that it would get better. After a few hours, I realized that it was one of the worst books I had read in years. Her personal life seems to be affecting her ability to spin a good story",0

Dual purpose liner: I used this liner on a recent camping trip from the Arizona desert right up to Glacier National Park and found it excellent at both extremes. In the heat it was fine on its own. In the mountains it provided the extra warmth inside my mummy sleeping bag - we awoke to heavy frost on our tent several mornings. It has a full length zip and a stuff sack. I used it inside out so that the zip was on the same side as my sleeping bag zip.,1
"Break Out The Bubble Gum...: Although the subjects of teenage pregnancy and extra-maritial sex were hot stuff when A Summer Place first hit the screen, the film's niaviety is too dated to keep our attention and not quite silly enough provide more than a few chuckles with its unintentional campiness. The actors perform with deadly earnestness, the script is merely so-so, and the film seems much longer than it actually is.",0
"Readable, good background, mostly anti-Richard: This is one of the more readable histories of the Wars of the Roses and as a biography of Richard III, it provides a very welcome background.Richard III is one of the more polarizing subjects for biographers, with some exonerating him of most or all of the charges that the Tudor biographers made against him and depict him as a good monarch, while others depict him as an unrelenting power-seeker and murderer, even beyond the standards for royalty during that time.Abbott is definitely of the latter camp although he doesn't disguise Richard's widely acknowledged bravery in battle and does depict the general atmosphere of murder, treachery, and vindictive cruelty of the day, tacitly contextualizing Richard as a product of his times and upbringing.Overall, this is a very readable biography and contextualizes its subject well, but readers used to modern biography style will miss the lack of source material and citations.",1
"Hooked on Kindle!: I became acquainted with e-books through my Palm Treo but I saw an Amazon Kindle advertisement and I bought a used 1st generation Kindle. I liked it so much (except for the many accidental page turnings) that I purchased the 6"" (Latest generation) Kindle. The many attributes of the Kindle(s); i.e.,the many book selections, ease of downloads, reasonable cost of books,compactness, battery life, font change capability, music listening,etc.. have made it an indispensable companion. I am never bored as long as I have my Kindle. By the way . . . I now have the Kindle DX (for which I am making my own cover).",1

"Not Bad: Though this follows UFC Classics 7 Buffalo, they skipped over the Ultimate Ultimate which you will hear mentioned in the broadcast. This was billed as the David vs Goliath card. Basically it featured guys around 200 lbs facing off against men 300 lbs or larger. It was an interesting card, with a few knockouts that you still see today in highlight clips. It features the superfight between Shamrock and Kimo, which was not a let down like the previous superfight. The card also is the introduction of Don Frye and Gary Goodridge to the MMA world. 2 guys still competing today. All in all, this is a good buy for someone looking for the genesis of the sport.",1

"Interesting: Why don't people who have great experiences as novices ever write books?? Am I the only person who ever spent a few years in a convent that was inhabited by intelligent, saintly folks with fine intentions, no favoritism. . . yet profoundly human individuals? Is it that rare? Reading these sorts of books, I can only be profoundly grateful for the experience that I had, and that I never ever met these sorts of people who appear in these books!",0
"Affirmation cards encourage more love to come into your life: Charming 2-sided affirmation cards with colorful illustrations are very upbeat. Initially I thought these cards were created for single people to help bring them true love however these cards are more about love in general. The cards remind you to show love to your family & friends as well as your significant other.Some of my favorite affirmations:""From time to time, I ask those I love, ""How can I love you more?""""Life is very simple. What I give out comes back to me. Today I choose to give love.""""I am in a joyous, intimate relationship with a person who truly loves me.""""Love happens! I release the desperate need for love and instead allow it to find me in the perfect time-space sequence.""These romance affirmation cards are really pretty & very uplifting. Enjoy!",1
"Rand was right, but she couldn't write.: This is not a book to read for pleasure. It is far too long and windy, the characters and pseudoscience are unrealistic, and everything is almost comically black 'n' white.There are some good ideas within, but it's probably not worth your time to wade in and find them. Read Rand's earlier fiction for somewhat better stories, or her nonfiction if you really want to get into her head.",0
"End it soon, please: 'Enjoyed' would not be the word I would use to describe how I felt when reading Kushiel's Dart. It made me uncomfortable, not because of its graphic sex and s/m elements, but because I thought the prose was sickeningly sweet and rich, the marks of a somewhat talented amateur, and I also thought the heroine was grotesquely perfect [jeez! Great in bed and she can SING, too! The J-Lo of fantasy!] But I did like it enough to buy this one. What a mistake.This book shows that an arguably brilliant beginning is difficult to sustain. Ms. Carey told a fine story the first time out, but it is now wearing thin. I don't know if I will bother to read the [hopefully] last of the Kushiel books, but if I do, I am certain it will not be in hardcover.",0
"Joyce Come Back!!: This is a poor effort from one of my favorite mystery authors. The plot is trite and silly, and the previous reviewer is correct. There is no mystery here until the last few pages. The last Lady Margaret book as well as the last Betty Trenka book were also very disappointing. I hope that Joyce's newest release, featuring both Margaret and Betty, makes up for three mediocre books in a row.",0
One of Alfred Hitchcock's Best: The picture is outstanding. A great copy. I love the story line. The restoration is very good and clarity is great.,1

Excellent Deal: What a great deal this is!!!! I love the convienence of printing my own pictures when I want to. This was a gift for my 23 year old daughter. This camera has been to Disney World and alot of other places. It is great for people who do not have alot of money to tie up in electronics. It is a basic camera that takes great pictures. I was very pleased when my shipment showed up on time I think it was even a little early. So far so good no problems. I would recommend this product to anyone.,1

"A DO NOT BUY ITEM: I tried to buy an item of good quality. The 7130 required a fair financial investment at the time I bought it. Just a little after the warranty expired the machine started to have trouble. Now it is my worst nightmare. It does not feed right, the last page of anything I copy does not complete and sticks in the outbound, this requires re-start every time. Did everything HP suggested. They believe it is a hardware problem. They suggested a service person come out. This machine has been used very lightly, no more than 15 to 20 ink cartriges. The cost per copy would figure very high for this machine as many copies are wasted as well as lots of ink. The big question - do I invest money in a bad machine or dump it and buy another brand?",0
"Disappointing!: Did Linda Fairstein all of a sudden realize she had written the required number of pages for her latest book? The ending certainly feels like that. Totally unsatisfying, with lots of open ends. A start for the next book? Sorry - I really liked Ms Fairstein's books, and the characters in those books, but - I won't buy the next book. I really felt like I wasted my money this time.",0
"Zoombinis Island Odyssey: My son was VERY disappointed with the Island Odyssey game. He has played both the Logical Journey and the Mountain Rescue and loved them, so I thought buying the third one was a good idea. Instead, it was a WASTE of my money. It brought him to tears because it was so difficult too quickly - unlike the other versions that gradually get harder. If you're looking to buy a Zoombinis game - don't buy this one, buy either Logical Journey or Mountain Rescue instead.",0
"Very Disappointing: I bought this cd because I love The Animals and it was a great price, 5.99. I should have known it was too good to be true. All their best songs have been re-recorded and completely butchered, particularly Dont Let Me Misunderstood. House of the Rising Sun and We Gotta Get Outta This Place don't fare well either. They made a great British Invasion band sound like a terrible 80's band. This was particularly disappointing because I've been looking for a complilation of The Animals for some time.I am returning this cd as soon as I can, and will buy another greatest hits package of theirs. To anyone considering buying this cd, be forewarned, and purchase a different G.H. set, as The Animals certainly have many.",0
"great product: A great energy saving device. It does with no doubt let you know just how much energy an appliance is using. I have 1956 International Harvestor refrigerator which I was told to get rid of because it is an energy Hog! After one week of energy usage checking with the P3, turns out the annual cost was less than $50 to run it. There are not too many new frigs that can match that, and the old frig is staying. In an era of energy savings,this Monitor will pay for itself in nothing flat.",1

"Don't Waste Your Time or Money: We watched the first ten minutes of this before we shut it off. It's essentially the quality of something a bunch of high schoolers would make: badly written, horribly shot (on an old camcorder, it looks like), with cheesy costumes, props, and fake mustaches. How this ended up on Amazon, let alone priced at $18, is beyond me. This is something that should be up on Youtube, not for sale on Amazon.Avoid this like the plague.",0

"Suckingly sucks....: Most of the Harry Potter fans have expressed their opinion already.Too expensive and incomplete box set is the major reason. So Warner Bros just wants to make money out of us.

"Excellent griddle: I recently received a Black and Decker GR100 as a gift and was terribly disappointed with it. That product was a testament to everything that can possibly be wrong with a griddle. The Presto, on the other hand, was exactly the opposite. The non-stick surface was just that, completely non stick. The heat was very evenly distributed and the tilt feature was a pleasant surprise. The large surface was a treat when cooking breakfast for five people. I could not be happier with this model.",1
"Not worth your $, unless you are really poor: The only good thing about this cd player is that it is really cheap. But otherwise, it is not BAD in particular, it is just not good. It takes a long time to read the cds, it uses up batteries quickly, there is a quiet hissing in the background when it plays, it won't hold your spot in a cd if you stop it, etc. Also, I have a tape adapter for my car stereo, and my old Sony player worked great with it; however, this thing sounds really weird in the car. Basically, this is a cheap cd player that gets the basic job done, but your money will definitely be more well-spent on a Sony or another leading brand.",0
"Kids still have to read this?: I had to read this book in high school, and I hated it. These characters live in a world that most people can't relate to, including someone such as myself who grew up poor in the south. These New England prep schools are places where the wealthy such as the Kennedys go to hang out with other rich people, and the whole scene just makes me want to puke.",0
"Too firm - disappointed: Bought this for my husband because he's always trying to swipe my Tempur-Pedic pillow. This pillow had a good rating and was very affordable, I thought, for memory foam. If I'm correct, a memory foam pillow is supposed to conform to the shape of your head and neck while giving adequate support. However, this one is pretty firm and is about as conforming as a block of regular foam like you'd find in a couch cushion. I say spend the extra money for a Tempur-Pedic.",0
a soft book to read: I read so much I get behind on my reviews. This one is not one of my favorites but very much worth the time to read. Hope you enjoy it.,1
Wrangler Angler Jeans: I have been wearing Wrangler Angler Jeans exclusively for the last 8+ years. The fit is the best. The extra pockets on the right leg come in handy to carry small tools and a pen. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the material is a little light (in weight and color) so they tend to look too worn out too fast. But I can usually get about 18 months out of a pair. The Tan ones wear longer and look good longer. I am truly a fan and hope they make these for a long time to come.,1
"Combinatorial Optimization: This is a book for mathematic nerds. There are no practical analytical problems in the book to make it useful for those of us involved in quick solutions to solve problems such as payoffs for investments beginning with forces of nature and then going through probability factors to get to real numbers of what can happen to various investment opportunities.I did recognize the value of the book for those who are on the front lines of determining how many and where ISPs might be on a route from Edmonton to Washington but one can use other methods of project controls. The math in this book was of no value --- even a wee bit.When I came across the TSP or Travelling Salesman Problem, it reminded me of how I used to name physics problems for students. But, I always thought the TSP was really the Farmer's Daughter problem. Apparently it ain't so.JR.",0
"One of the worst days in American history!: This doll works equally well as a conversation piece or voodoo implement.The day GWB declared ""mission accomplished"" signifies the start of the REAL war after the invasion...the war against the insurgents.

"Repeditive, not worth the cost: To its credit, the Romanian tapes contained in this volume were an excellent way to practice proper Romanian pronunciataion. And, they were a valuable resource for learning the Romanian language.The tapes started simply and gradually increased in complexity as they progressed. Unfortunately, the transition between tapes was too gradual. When progressing through the tapes, as few as three or four words were added in a single 1/2 hour tape.In my opinion, Pimleur (sp?) missed the primary advantage of the tape format -- the ability to replay them until they are mastered. By missing this point, they only placed 2 hours of material on 5 hours of tape.",0
"decent flavor, but I expected more.: Comming from a regular coffee pot, I expected it to have richer flavor. Its fine (better than my old coffee pot) but even with Tim Hortons coffee, it still doesnt taste like Tim Hortons (you upstate NY and Canadians know what Im talking about lol)..Takes a long time to brew (I have it on a timer so its not a big deal). Easy to clean, seems well made, just wish it had a richer flavor.",0
"Fig Cheater: Huh? What happened to the ingested fig? To the excrement in the park? To the severed thumb buried in the floor? Yes these are major fuel sources that (up to a point) propel the plot forward. What happens, even in the broadest of terms, to the characters? To Wally for instance? Atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending.For Amazon to sell this book with (and by implication to compare it to) the exquisite ""Shadow of the Wind"" shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books (set in 20th century Europe seems the only obvious similarity) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one.",0
"Not my favorite infrared book: Of course with art being such a subjective medium, it's hard to be objective. That being said, I'm not terribly impressed with work presented in this book. The technical information is fine, but why confuse the purpose of the book. The images are mediocre at best. I don't see any new ground being explored with the incredible creative tools that are described. Buy it if you are trying to gather a library of books relating to infrared photography, not if you want to be inspired or educated.",0
"3 hours of my life I'll never have back: Oh, my what a waste of time. I loved Sonia Blue, and tried this because it seemed there was extensive cross-pollinization between that reader group and this one. So I gave it a shot, and was rewarded with plastic characters, a transparent plot, and uninspired writing. I give it two stars because it did keep me interested until the end, mainly to see if it would get any better and because I do enjoy the genre. Just not this telling of it.",0
"what the (bleep)?: I thought this book would be a chronical of Nicole and OJ's relationship from the get-go, and how things eventually devolved to the sad state they were in at the end, but instead, it focused more on Faye Resnick's scatterbrained rantings about restaurants, clubs, sexual partners, vacations, and utterly soulless, vapid ""friendships""...all provided in non-chronological order! There was relatively little information about the relationship between the famous couple: strange in a book that purports to be about that very subject. I feel sorry for Faye and Nicole, because I come away from reading this disjointed, rambling, bizarre account of seemingly disconnected events with the impression that both of them were seriously emotionally damaged women. So at least that was conveyed well.",0
"Lots of fluff...could have been 1/10th the pages.: First off, the book is poorly described in the table of contents. God help you if you need to find something specific in a reasonable amount of time. This book could have delivered the critical info in a 15 page pamphlet. There are simply some things you need to do and a few others that you need to avoid. You are better off buying ""2001 Guide to Literary Agents"" and ""2002-2003 Writer's Guide to Book Editors, Publishers, and Literary Agents."" If you buy those two books, you'll get as much distilled info about book proposals as you need WHILE AT THE SAME TIME getting the contact information you need.",0

"Great job: I thought ""Thoughts & Feelings: Taking Control of Your Moods and Your Life: A Workbook of Cognitive Behavioral Techniques"" by Matthew McKay was a very helpful workbook. It is something that I will keep and refer to in years to come. I was especially comforted by McKay's comment that you can cope, that folks have withstood wars, famine, sieges, death, etc. and lived through it, that we have the capacity to handle much more than we think we can. I think of that paragraph several times a day, every day.",1

"Best In Series: This was a good book. Not quite as good as watching the show, but the characters are well done and the plot is decent. However, it is the only one in the series so far that I liked. If Roger Stern writes any more for the series, I'll buy his, but not any of the other authors.",1
Wi-Fi Home Networking by Raymond Smith: What a helpful book! I abhor manuals because of all the techno-language. This book is direct and easy to understand.,1
"GREAT NEW NANCY ALBUM...Feels great to me!: In respose to the review above: True, the best place to start off, if you're a new Nancy Sinatra fan is Rhino's compilation ""The Hit Years."" ""How Does It Feel?"" feels great to me. But then again, I have been a huge Nancy fan for many years now. So this album was certainly a treat for me, as I believe it was for any true Nancy fan. To hear songs never before released is quite exciting, especially coming from an artist you adore. Nancy Sinatra is a much underappreciated artist, and just think about it: She had to live in the shadow of her famous father and when people think ""Sinatra,"" they think wonderful, and Nancy is a disappointment to some. Sure her vocal talents aren't up to Streisand's or her dad's, but look at her! Still has a huge following and continues to do what she loves to do! (which is great for us fans). So, if you're a new Nancy fan, stick with ""The Hit Years."" But if you're a REAL Nancy fan, ""How Does That Feel?"" will not let you down!",1

"""Right To Die"" Masters Of Horror: ""Right To Die"" is an interesting and entertaining episode. Directed by Rob Schmidt, who is responsible for the suprisingly good horror movie ""Wrong Turn"", proves here he does have some skill. The episode doesn't try to deliver any major gore or scary suspense, but it does make you think about if someone is in a vegetative state or permanent coma, who decides if they have the right to die?What saves this episode from being boring is the great acting from every character in the movie and the mystery that builds up towards the second half of the story about who is actually going to live and who is actually going to die.",1
good beginning silly ending: The author has talent - he can describe events and scenes. He cannot link the plot together logically.The plot zooms out of control and becomes silly and irrelevant.Any more comments are not worth the effort. The book was a big disappointment.If curious - wait awhile and buy it used under $1.,0
"BUGGS: We found this game would not play on my new dell computer and only played on my husband's new alienware system with choppy sound and graphics - and he bought this computer specifically for gaming. So I think the software must be defective. We have backpack and lost city also - they play well and my son (2.5) likes them both, but i found that with lost city all the games were about numbers - ignoring other concepts like colors, letters and shapes. Try this software at your own risk, maybe they will fix the bugs. I found tech support to be a frustrating, time consuming experience with an automated system that was confusing and annoying. Good luck.",0
"Pain in the ear...: I purchased a set of these at my local retailer and I am HIGHLY disappointed.The biggest complaint I have is that the darn things wont stay put! You have to constantly readjust the things over and over, again and again, and as soon as you think you've got it right...they pop out again. If you use your 'pod while exercising, DON'T BUY THESE. The only way they even remotely stay in place is if you don't move!Now I do have to say, if (and that's a big IF) you can get the things in just right, the sound quality is good. But for the price I paid, I wish I had bought an ""over the ear"" style set of headphones instead...the hassle of fooling with these things is just far too annoying.",0
more than a game: Nintendo has done an amazing job with this system. My boys (13 and 16) love this system. I would caution to start smaller children with the game cube before spending the money on this system. It offers games for small children but there are so many additional features that younger children may never use.,1
"Works great - On a Mac: This item works exactly as promised. On a Mac at least, but then almost everything does. I don't think it's appropriate for Windows users to fault this product for the shortcomings of their OS. With Mac OS X, I plugged the adapter in, and viola!, it worked. I was iSynching with my T68 within seconds. When that was done, I set up Salling Clicker and was using my phone to remotely control iTunes. Not a problem, not ever. There is nothing wrong with this product, and I own several. The only gripe I have is that it seems a bit pricey, but it works so effortlessly that I guess it's worth it.",1
"BUYER BEWARE! Serious paper feed defect.: I bought this printer on a whim after having been a satisfied Canon user for a decade. I learned my lesson and will never buy another HP product. This printer worked well for about one month of light use. After this, it began to have problems picking up paper. I have used only HP Bright Inkjet paper, and the paper is crisp and fresh, so it's not a problem with humidity or curled paper. It's reached a point where every sheet of paper has to be individually coaxed into the feed mechanism. Even then, it jams about half the time.It's hard to believe that HP did not discover this problem during product development and testing. Yet they have put this piece of junk on the market. I'm having to write mine off as a loss because it's now too late to return it to the store, and HP's only solution is to replace it with the exact same printer with the same problem. I'm hoping someone files a class action suit against HP for the junk they put on the market.",0
"Disappointing because the stars ARE stars: Madonna has proven time and again that she's a talented actress, from the sly fun of ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" to her phenomenal performance in ""Evita"", and of course Sean Penn's an Oscar winner. Although this is one of their earlier films - WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???? This movie isn't fun, just dumb, from the blase plot to the far-fetched premise of Madonna as a missionary. This talented couple is utterly wasted on this flick and the lousy script is more of a tragedy than the Penns' failed marriage. Ugh.",0
"Interesting, but not very helpful: This is a cute little book that would probably be fun for someone who had recently moved to New York City and was trying to find their way to fun things to do and see. We didn't find it very useful for our very brief visit to the city. The references to fun places to have ""girl stuff"" done were intriguing, and, as I said, would probably be fun for someone who lived in the city. Overall, for planning a quick visit -- or a first-time visit -- I don't think people would find this book very helpful.",0
"Sorry -: This is only an opinion, and don't get all cranky over it. I bought this game for forty bucks after months and months of playing both WCW Mayhem and BackStage Assault for playstation, within a few days of constant playing and frustration this game was being returned to the store i bought it. while this game has great features, good graphics and endless possibilities. The play control and pulling off moves and finishers is horrible and limiting. Unless your a hardcore WWF fan i wouldn't suggest buying this if your interested in a wrestling game.",0
"Best travel mug I've found!: I absolutely love this mug! I've had one for five years, and still use it daily. I drink my coffee slowly, and it's the only mug I've found that keeps my coffee hot until the very end. I also love that you can close the top completely, so if it tips over, the coffee doesn't spill. The only con I've found is that it can be really hard to unscrew the top after it's been sitting closed all day. That's such a minor thing that I still think this deserves five stars.",1
"A treasure of real rock: I remember listening to Rory Gallagher songs in my high-school parties. It was the years that we danced with the rock sounds of Scorpions, Styx, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Sabbath and all this great groups we now miss a lot. This rare cd can only bring me memories from a time all full of freedom and independence. That's why I recommend it without any reservation to all of you who grew up in the late 70's and the early 80's. I would have rated this cd with five stars if the tracks hsve been studio recordings and not live.",1
Not at all clean: I was so disappointed in this book. In the first few chapters they refer so often to body parts I did not finish it and deleted it from my kindle. I like things left to the imagination.,0
Best book I've ever read: I've read this book twice already and I plan to read it again because I think it is the best book ever written.,1

"Awful: Martin Lawrence is my favorite comedian hands down, but man does this 'movie' stink. 'You So Crazy' is 100 times better than this....this....this garbage. Point Blank ...IT'S NOT FUNNY. In all actuality I fell asleep on it. HOW DO YOU FALL ASLEEP DURING STAND UP COMEDY? There were about two parts that I actually laughed at and I don't even remember what they were about. IT truly honestly was a waste of time. I don't even see how dedicated fans could even get a chuckle out of this.IF you want to see some funny Martin Lawrence check out his new movie NATIONAL SECURITY...,now that joint is hilarious, and skip this mess.",0
"Excellent Book about Forgiveness and the Power of Love: This book was excellent! I read it in two days. It is a lesson to all of us. For Imaculee to go through what she did and suffer the tremendous loss that she did and still manage to forgive and love those responsible is a true testament of the Power of God's love and how good does ultimately triumphs over evil, hatred, and prejudice. I highly recommend this book.",1
Horrible!: Downloaded it for book club. Difficult to read and to follow the plot. I found this book to be stupid from beginning to end.,0
"Spartan: The word aptly describes the authors cruising style, and unfortunately his writing style. Chris White's ""The Cruising Multihull"" covers all of the same subjects in much greater detail, providing information which will let the reader make his/her own intelligent choices.",0
"Abduction, or ""My 8th Grade Creative Writing Assignment"": This book is terrible. A plot line driven mainly by homophobia, underground humans cleverly named ""interrans,"" unflinching use of exclamation points, and absolutely no character development at all makes for one of the worst reads EVER. The only reason I finished was that I kept thinking: ""This has to get interesting at some point, right?."" Alas, no.",0
"Pathetic Game: I do not Recomend this game. First of all, if you do things to quickly, the game crashes. The graphics are O.K., but the computer [isn't ]. Unless you want to control your player, they are a long way from the ball. Also, occasionally, the quarterback tends to throw to a reciver the computer picks. On defence, the pass defence [isn't good]. You cannot intercept easy-to-catch passes. And, the man to man coverage is horrible. Personally, I don't recomend this game.",0
pretty interesting: This book has good info on Israel and the Old Testament and New Testament and how everything is related.,1

"I LOVE this mug!: I had one of these mugs, bought second-hand in a thrift shop. It was just broken, and I am just as broken as the glass! This had to be the BEST coffee and hot tea mug I ever owned! Now I have to buy a whole case to replace my favorite mug, but it's worth it. It just FITS my hand SO well, I have a smallish female hand, and the handle on this mug is PERFECT to fit all 4 fingers through, and then you can wrap your hand around it's warmth while the handle is looped over the back of your fingers. It's the BEST mug ever! The weight is great, not too heavy and not too light, and it's bottom heavy enough that the cats never knocked it over if they jumped up on the desk next to it. The rim is thick and nice on your lip, very round and smooth. A GREAT MUG! Perfect for a latte or a cup of hot tea! Just keep your boyfriend away from it so he doesn't break it! (But they only sell them by the case anyways, so I guess that's not going to be a problem next time!)",1
"Where's the passion?: If you're looking for vampiric moments in mostly literary fiction, you may enjoy this book. If you enjoy poetry, the book is about 1/3 poetry. If you're seeking enjoyable, passion-filled stories about vampires, you may be disappointed.Not a fan of poetry, I concentrated on the stories. Quite a few got bogged down in excessive narrative and/or description. Others are brief excerpts from stories or novels, so there's nothing to satisfy a reader. Some are about vampires in only the loosest sense: one ""vampire"" is a plant.I found the offerings by Anne Rice and Alexandre Dumas the most readable, but both are romantic stories, which may not appeal to everyone.I read vampire stories for passionate characters and situations. This book seemed dry and bland to me.",0
"80s music that doesn't fit in: Enuff Z'Nuff's only best album was their 1989 album because it had tons of good songs in it like ""Fly High Michelle"" and ""New Thing"" but 1985 has bad uninspiring songs that sounds like 80s pop for classic rock stations ! Why have Enuff Z'Nuff not been making stuff that sounded like 80s glam rock ? It seems really bad that Donnie has been making songs that make me feel not into the beat . That's really sad . The worse song is ""Day By Day"" .",0

"Cheesy: To help calm employee responses to layoffs, the authors present a parable about mice and men asserting that independent reflection betokens bad character.Compare this with the following credo: ""You see the ox, comrades, admire him! He eats where we command him to eat. If we let him graze on this field, he eats. If we take him to another field where there is not enough grass, he grazes all the same. He cannot move about, he is supervised. When we tell him to pull the plough, he pulls it."" Pin Yathay, in his memoire about the starvation of his family in Khmer Rouge camps (""Stay Alive, My Son"", available on Amazon.com), quotes this as ""an often-heard Khmer Rouge parable.""Layoffs are inevitable and they produce anxiety, but the authors' response in ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" raises more problems than it settles. The book's main virtue lies in having sparked several parodies that contain some good laughs.",0
"encourages you to write.: I started writing a journal this year and I am so glad I chose this journal. It is decent size, bordering on the bigger size. It open flat. It has a blue binding and the paper is of a high quality. The quotes in it are so appropriate for women.My only quibble is that the prints of flowers on the top and bottom of the pages could have been of a nice pastel color instead of the browinsh tinge that they have.",1
"Props to Isobel + Friends: The arrangements on The Green Fields of Foreverland are wonderfully sparse and lovingly played. They are clear and simple, a virtue that most bands could learn from. The playing is certainly amateur, but makes no effort to hide this and that is (mostly) charming. Most of the songs are very quiet and full of atmosphere.The lyrics are lovely and poetic, occasionally funny. It's not navel-gazing stuff.",1

"I LOVE IT!: Finally, a knife that slices through everything easily, no work needed. This knife is everything the GINSU(tm) knife promised and more. This knife slices through everything without tearing. My husband had asked if our old knives were just getting old. I did not think that was possible because I kept them sharp (I thought). I was wrong - our old knives just got old.",1
"Awesome!: This is one wild story! One scene had me nearly in tears while another had me in stitches. It's an excellent follow up to Fractured Time. I've never seen or read a blend of magic, fantasy, science fiction and horror like in Twisted Fate. The plots continue to grow and the antagonists are exciting. I can't wait to read book three. You'll never read a story with so much action and emotion.",1
"This CD is brilliant.: I dunno, perhaps it's just that I am the most ""tuned-in"" this particular moment in pop culture history for this album, but in my book this is his funniest record to date. People who don't think parodying rap music is funny, I guess, are not going to find much to like, but I thought it was hysterical. Definitely worth the purchase, although you might find yourself downloading the CD all over again from the internet because of the whole DualDisc thing...I bought it for the DVD side. I already have my burned copy -- even though Al asks that I not download, I'm sure it's okay because in the end I still put down my hard-earned cash.",1

"I'm back for another!: Others have said that your degree of satisfaction with this tripod will depends on how you intend to use it. I bought it to support anRCA EZ205 Small Wonder Digital Camcorder with 2 Hour Recording and 1GB Included Memoryto record music rehearsals with my duet partner. We've got instruments, music stands, instrument stands, and other things to deal with, so I put weight at a premium. I was amazed to find a unit not only so light but also so inexpensive. The tripod performed splendidly, so I'm back for another for our mp3 recorder.",1

Don't waste your money. Liz is creatively ""dead."" This is the last you'll ever hear from her (it's been a couple years). Buy her sometimes fun, rocking and clueless first two CDs",0
"Does not fit Panasonic DMC-FZ50: This filter shows up as a recommended accessory for the Panasonic DMC-FZ50. However, it does not fit this particular camera.The diameter is right, 55mm. But the threads are not right. At first, I suspected that the threads-per-inch is different. But I went to a local camera store and purchased another filter, and this Tiffen filter screws in to the new filter OK. So I suspect that it's not the threads-per-inch, but maybe the threads are too tall (they have a slightly large diameter which binds against the camera).The man at my local camera store said that Tiffen changed their packaging a long while back, and the filter that I had was in the older packaging. So perhaps this filter was made for older film cameras and not for newer digital cameras (that's him talking, not me).Either way, this filter only screws in about 1/3 of a turn and then starts to bind. Don't buy this filter to fit a Panasonic DMC-FZ50.",0

"Bored rich women of the world, get dogs!: I must agree with the reader who just wanted to scream ""Get a dog!"" The first half of the book was good, and I sympathized with Paris.Then she moves to a new city and a great job falls in her lap. After a few bad dates and failing to make any real friends, she decides that she needs a baby. Never mind that it is mentioned over and over again that she works such loooooong hours, often getting home after 10:00 PM. Never mind that in real life, nobody gets to adopt a healthy infant within two weeks. Never mind that all Paris needed to do was *get a life*!All I got out of this book was the lesson that I really need to try reading something with more substance.",0
"Don't waste your time.: This is a poor bootleg of the 1974 movie called Police Woman. Though it is being marketed as a Jackie Chan film it is not. His role in it is only that of a cameo and his character is referred to as a ""gang member"".",0
"Terrible EE book: We at WVU use this book for the intro EE classes. I have nearly 140 credits & this was the worst book I had ever used until John Bertin's Aerodynamics For Engineers book came along. You can read it forever as I did and not learn anything. I dropped the EE-221 class in 2007 and sold this book back knowing we'd use it again as it is useless except for the hw problems assigned. I used an alternate book the second time as a guide and got through it with a B. Of course my 2nd instructor was very competent so that did help. Along with the Bertin book, this one shares the unique distinction of having no answers in the back to any problems. Just hope for old solutions. Also the examples are very easy and the hw problems are outrageously difficult. Very hardcore and not meant for someone who doesn't already know the material, which would defeat the purpose of it all.",0
"Simple: This book is so simple to read, no one can deny its genuine goodness. This is not, however, for those of us out there that assume that simply buying a book will change their lives or make themselves feel better. But this book is definitely a good start, and a very sound grounding in the art of living a happy, wholesome life. It teaches us the simple things that many of us forget in our day to day lives: how not to hurt people, and how not to hurt ourselves. If you're bored of all these preacher types, then this book is for you: Deepak Chopra is by no means a preacher, merely a humble teacher, happy to give you a guiding hand on your journey through life. Enjoy!",1

"A controversial book with insight: The author presented several valid points which challenge the established financial economics. The author demonstrated his deep insight in the topic. The framework he is proposing is new and interesting. I am not sure whether his fiber bundle theory is ""more correct and more useful"" than the existing economics theories (it might be though, I am currently still reading the book), but certainly the author has laid out his theory on a solid footing. I believe Ilinski has done a good job to make me look at the financial economics from a very different point of view. No matter whether you agree with him on the whole or not, this book is one of the books financial economists should read.",1

"ODOR-ant.......not DE-odorant!!: I am a 23 year old woman and nurse. I have recently tried to phase all natural products into my life. Tom's Lavender Scented Deodorant was the very first all-natural deodorant that I tried. I have NEVER EVER had a problem with body odor. I am physically active and don't sweat much at all. I applied Tom's as soon as I bought it. I liked the earthy lavender scent. I was dinking around the house for the remainder of the evening. I woke up in the morning and sniffed my under arm..... oh, BOY, the fumes were OFFENSIVE. I could not believe that was coming from ME! I come across some pretty funky people as I am a nurse, but none as funky as me after using Tom's deodorant after one application. Save your $$ DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. This deodorant makes you smell TERRIBLE.... it is an ODORANT, not a de-odorant. YUCK YUCK YUCK. Use Jason's brand instead. It works great!Jason Natural Cosmetics - Deodorant Aloe Vera Gel, 2.5 oz sticks",0
"A DISAPPOINTMENT: Agree with the viewer from Dayton. These are not full-screen videos but are actually two-thirds normal size and framed with a goofy red matte to make them appear larger. Interviews with rappers are shrunk down to even smaller windows. Whoever created the DVD master did rap fans a great disservice. Although it would be wrong to expect 10-year old videos to match today's technical standards, it doesn't appear that this compilation was created from original source videos. If you're truly desperate to view some hip hop history, buy it--it does contain some good musical choices. Otherwise, wait for a company that has a sincere respect for the music to put out a ""hip hop time capsule"" compilation worthy of the name.",0

"A misunderstood book........: This work is not meant as a treatise on opening play. The reader is guided by Yaz through the various openings so the player can understand how different openings vie for the center, and how key concepts such as time, & development(force) are applied in the different openings. This book enables the reader to grasp various ideas from the different openings as it relates to the above & important opening concepts. While I do not employ the openings Yaz suggests one need not fear of choosing his own. A nice work on how to understand various opening concepts!",1
"Steel darkness: Great package for an excellent movie! Received as a gift.The movie is great and beyond any Batman movie, to date, but if you're into special features and behind-the-scenes documentaries along with a DVD case that's above-the-norm, then this edition comes highly recommended.",1
"This book is a total disappointment: After reading all the positive comments, I bought this book. After reading it, I was totally disappointed.The writing style is good, but technically this book is weak and full of errors. There is no doubt that the author never tested the code. The code listing on the CD rom is just a bunch of text files ending with with .txt extension. The book is no more than a copy & paste of stuff taken off the net. For example, to explain the BMP entity bean, the author used a ProductBEan example, in the ejbLoad() call, the product ID member field was used. But does the author understand the ID field must be set somehow? This is done in the ejbActivate() call in SUN's online tutorial, but in the book the ejbActive() is empty. Clearly, the author does not understand the life-cycle of ejbs.So if you are looking for a J2EE book, look elsewhere, if you are trying to learn some JSP, it may offer some help.",0

"Did Marilyn French REALLY write this?: Formulaic, tedious and stereotyping. The subject was compelling and intense, but the way the story was written detracted heavily from what could have been a powerful novel. The characters were incredibly one dimensional and stereotypical. Their behavior time and again came as absolutely no surprise. Very disappointing, especially since the Women's Room, and Her Mother's Daughter were both such powerful and compelling books!",0
Love this movie: This product is great. I love all of the state of the art additions that Lucas made to make the movies even better than the originals!,1
"Not much repeat watchability...: First be advised that this is an Italian made sci-fi. The soundtrack has been adequately dubbed into english however the Aplha print is VERY poor and there is a large audio hissing throughout the entire feature.While the script and acting is competent enough, I found it boring with minimal special effects. I cannot really pinpoint the reason, but it is very different from the sci-fi films made in the US at this same time. The whole thing had a kind of surreal quality to it. I found it hard to get into. I found the other popular lost Italian sci-fi flick 'Caltiki the Immortal Monster' much more watchable. DTSE is recommended only for completeists ONLY.If you are looking for very good, lesser known 50's sci-fi titles to add to your collection, try hunting down Unknown World, First Man into Space, Creature with the Atom Brain, Lost Missile, Rocketship XM or Donovan's Brain. All very solid 50's sci-fi films with great repeat watchability.",0

"Good vacuum for the money.: I received the vacuum a while ago so this is a review from ~1 month of use.I was happy to see how fast it arrived. When i tested it I was pleasantly suprised at how light it was and how easily is sped across the floor. After 10+ years with a hand-me-down Kirby that weighs a ton that may not be saying much but I was happy.It is a plastic, refurbished unit but the bagless feature and the ease of emptying the container are hard to beat. If you area true dust allergy sufferer you may need to stay with a bag vac because of the dust when you empty the cup.I think that its well worth the reconditioned price!!",1
"Not worth the price!: My oldest daughter saved her allowance for this, and I feel like Hasbro owes her a refund. First, there are only two activites to this set, the ferris wheel and the ""roller coaster"". The ferris wheel will fall apart if the child isn't careful, although unlike other reviewers ours will hold three ponies. The track for the coaster comes apart at the drop of a hat, and forget about trying to move this thing. As much of a cash cow as the whole MLP line is, you'd think Hasbro would put a little more money into production, even if it raised the cost of the finished product. I would NOT recommend spending your money on this one.",0
"Misleading: I purchased this cookie-cutter because of its four-inch diameter size. However, when I received the order I found that the four-inch diameter is at the top of the cookie-cutter and not the actual cutting diameter. So if you're considering purchasing this is not a four-inch cutting diameter.",0
"Advertised: The clock was not as advertised. It was to be radio controlled but it did not change according to the new daylight savings time date.

He tried other various brands, which always become to harden and wet in the area he pee-pees. But they never satisfied him.",1
axim x30 BoxWave Styra Ballpoint Pen: I have purchased 6 of these and they are the cheapest and most poorly built product that I have ever paid for. The cap that covers the pen will start to crack within 48 hours and will no longer stay on the stylus. Then your stylus will be stuck inside of the holder and you need a pair of tweezers to get it out. I purchased these in two seperate orders. The first on purpose and the second by accident. a total of 6 styli and all six were useless within a week. the idea is great but the materials used are cheap and innefective. do not buy this product if you want to use it for more than 2 days,0
"Lots of fluff: If you are thinking about reading this book then PLEASE consider reading Brian Greene's ""The Elegant Universe"" instead. It does a much better job on string theory and it is more current with the latest scoop on the second superstring revolution.The second half of Hyperspace is light on content. There is a lot of filler. After reading it, I thought that it was because there was not much else in the way of superstring theory advances. Hyperspace is truly outdated because of its '94 print date. The second superstring revolution began in 1995 which means you are missing out on a number of recent advances. Greene's book gives you the full history of string theory plus the most recent work which was much more fufilling.",0
"just skip this: I agree quite thoroughly with the reviewers who expressed extreme dislike for Linda Howard's ""White Out."" It was sickening. Some of us read romance for the romance, not for explicit descriptions of sexual relationships which begin before the hero (and I use the term loosely) is even conscious.As for the rest, Jude Deveraux's hero is a paternalistic town despot. Margaret Allison and Mariah Stewart tell fairly ho-hum stories about creative, artsy types going home and falling in love, one with a (supposedly) unconventional doctor and the other with her first love, with whom she had lost touch through a lame misunderstanding--don't you just hate it when these people don't TALK to each other?The star goes to Stef Ann Holm for ""Jolly Holly""; though not a total classic, this story does introduce a handful of very memorable minor characters, especially an intriguing couple of ""elves"" named Yule and Tide.",0

"Nuclear Hijinks, Awesome Trains, and Metaphysics: At the beginning of this original novel, a nuclear physicist with a definitely bent view of reality climbs a shot tower, intending to use the atomic bomb as transportation into the universe next door. Not far away a hapless lieutenant named Perkins boards a bus bound for Camp Sagebrush and, so he believes, a rising career in the New Atomic Army. As the countdown to detonation to proceeds, a small civilian plane, piloted by a couple of strong-minded women, searches the darkness for clues to a mystery that will surprise and probably scare you to death. Reading The Atomic Express is like watching an action movie, but the subtext is totally surreal. If you appreciate off-beat humor, high intrigue, the metaphysics of quantum science -- and of course trains -- you'll love this book!",1
"Total Piece of Junk !!!: I was prepared to deal with limited memory and the unlit screen. What I wasn't prepared for is the fact that every time I start this thing now it jumps back to Jan. 2003. Every fourth time (or thereabouts) it loses all data and requires a reset (screen centering, date, time, etc.)and then a hot sync to reinstall all of the lost data. Now after six months it when it hot syncs it won't add any new appointments.I bought this because it was inexpensive and I wanted to see if I would get enough use out of a PDA without spending $400 and having it collect dust.I found out three things.1. I think PDAs are a fine idea and I will use one a great deal.2. You get what you pay for and the Palm Zire 21 and Palm's quality and customer service are truly unimpressive (90 day warranty then $25 per call for service and no useful information on their web site)3. I will buy another more sophistcicated PDA from one of their competitors.",0
"didn't last 2 weeks: Not too hard to install, but didn't sound much louder than my oem Nissan horns and after two weeks one of the horns stopped working.Took them off and put back my original horns. Sixty dollars wasted.Can't say I'd recommend them to anyone.",0
"A real Seagal stinker: From the amateurish opening scene car chase, with Seagal's chubby mug filling the entire screen (and the green screen backgrounds from the car) to the really hokey ending - ugh!The budget was very low, as the special effects of Seagal shooting down a helicopter gunship with his .45 really sucked And the insipid Kung-fooey school of students. Just can't say enough for this bad movie.I think he has a double standing in some scenes showing him in the shadows or of his back (as in Belly Of The Beast) because he's really put on some oink-oink pounds. And he has terrible pancake make-up applied to his aging mug. Plus, his over-dyed black hair with out-of-style ponytail makes him look like a clown.",0
"Umm...alrighty then....: Here is more of the ""make it up as you go along"" variety of Wicca. As with most books written today on Wicca, the author mixes up a batch of ""instant Wicca lite"" and serves it with a big ladle. Today Wicca seems to be whatever anyone feels it is at any particular time of day. This ""blind leading the blind"" approach to Wicca is very puzzling, but seems to be what people want.So, if you don't really care what Wicca is truly about, and want just another idea whipped up in someone's backroom overnight, then this book is as ""good"" as any.",0
"My favorite of the series!: This one goes on the keeper shelf for sure! What a terrific love story between two people who have cared for each other for years but come from such different worlds that a marriage shouldn't work. I read the reviews that said Wolfe was mean and abusive to Jessi, and I can only think that those readers lack the common sense to see that he is only *acting* that way to protect Jessi from the kind of life he leads. Truly bad men do not have the love and support of dear friends like the Blacks and Morans, but they (and any astute reader) know what a special man Wolfe is. Love makes real men do stupid things sometimes - why should a well-written romance hero be any different? Any reader who's looking for a great adventure and satisfying conclusion should stick it out with Wolfe like Jessi does.",1
"Disjointed, poor script and above all....unfunny?!: How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.",0
"Easily chipped.....: I was so excited to find these dishes and when I read the reviews here I just knew I'd love them. I ordered 4 sets of dinnerware and had intentions of ordering other pieces to match, but when I received my shipment, I had one plate broken (shipping problem) and a few of the pieces were chipped here and there. I knew with my large rough-and-tumble family that these dishes would never hold up at my house so sadly, I sent them all back. Amazon was very gracious and gave me free return shipping and promised to completely refund my money. THANKS AMAZON!I thought that Churchill China was made in England, but my dishes said ""Churchill China Made in China"". Perhaps that is why the quality was not up to snuff.Jody (who thought the dishes were beautiful, but beauty is as beauty does)",0

Enron DVD: Well this did not work out the way I'd hoped. I could not use the DVD in either my brand new HD DVD player or my older one. Nor did it work in the DVD player at the political office where I wanted to show it either. It only worked on my computer. So I was not able to use it for the purpose I desired.,0

"Great Knife: First of all, Gerber is a great quality knife company. The Gator is no exception. The grips are very rugged and provide a non-slip grip even in water. I first saw this on Bear Grylis's show Man vs.Wild in a few seperate episodes and I figured if its good enough for him, then it'll work for me. I have one hundred acres of property that I hang out and camp on at least once a month and I must say this knife is the most used tool in my arsenal. I love this knife and at its current price, you will as well.",1
"Dr No: Ian Fleming at his best is the best, but this book is quite poor. Only this one and Live and Let Die are inferior to the film versions, in my opinion. Fleming's writing itself is superb as ever, but the plot here is weak, as though he is making it up as he goes along. Particularly bad is the scene with Honey and Bond half way through the novel, which is really corny. And you wonder why a trained spy would go so close to the mechanical dragon that he is in the line of its flames. Surely, he would have kept himself hidden at that point?! The desciptions of Jamaica and Quarrel's character are good, but the whole thing lack any real suspense.",0
needed service after 6 months: had good results with panasonic microwaves in the past and liked the variable inverter power and good size. However this oven needed warranty service after 6 months and I replaced in 18 months later when it died.,0
"A Book That Will Hold Your Interest!: This book definitely held my interest. It deals with various events in Ms. Farris' life that led her to become a Christian and join Jews for Jesus, and then later to renounce her affiliation and to return to Judaism and a ""normal"" life. Along the way it also addresses various incidents that occurred in the Farris family. An interesting and informative chapter deals with eating disorders, and skating is also a dominant theme. I would highly recommend this book.",1
"Outing Riley: Well-crafted independent film, portraying the cause for acceptance compellingly. Powerful that the story is written, produced, directed, and acted by a straight guy with convincing, heartfelt support from crew and supporting cast. Clever storyline and interest-engaging format wherein the primary character speaks in asides to the audience and uses first-person narration to move the story. The acting is superb. Too bad haven't seen more work by the creator.",1
"A ""must"" for all Sound of Music lovers: ""Forever Liesl"" is a wonderful tribute to the making of the movie. Anyone who is facinated with the film will love Ms. Carr's warm and genuine account.",1
"Maybe good for pre or young teens: I took this book as a ""talking book"" on CD on a road trip. I really wanted it to be good because we had an 8 hour drive through the desert. Got to the last CD, and just could not take it anymore. Ejected the CD and never did finish it. Trite and Hardy Boys-ish.",0
"not recomended: I was disappointed with this DVD because it is an amateur recording, no good sound, no good images. I don't recommend.",0
"Disappointed: Chriton comes across as preachy, patronizing and condescending in this book. He has a political viewpoint to push, and he pushes it hard, losing his audience in the process. The data he uses to support his viewpoint is mostly outdated. He is basically telling his audience that if they believe global warming to be real, they are uneducated fools and he has the data to prove it.Let's not forget that Chriton is an MD, not a climatologist. His take on global warming is no more relevant than that of any other educated person who reads journals and compilations of data: It's an opinion. If he were a climatologist, I'd take him more seriously.I wish I had not bought this book.",0
"Exactly what she was looking for: This little case was a birthday present for my wife. She's got a W150, and was storing it in a random case she had from something else. This case is well built, a nice color pink, has a replacement hand strap for the camera (does NOT attach to the case as I thought prior to buying it), and my wife loves it. The inside is covered in a soft felt, which will help keep the camera free from scratches. Also the fit is perfect for this camera, nice and snug, but easy to remove.",1
"Not much to be said here: It's just a tight package of streetwise hardcore from Detroit. The lyrics deal with issues and events in the turbulent lives of the band members; the end message is one of hope and keeping your strength up in a world that can seem hopeless. Musically, the vocals can seem a bit odd at times but you get used to them fast. Guitar work is good; nothing too technical, but the musicianship base is definitely in this. Drummer Jeff was one of the best drummers in hardcore and his talents are on display throughout. Bassist (and talented tattoo artist) Aaron is now with Walls of Jericho. Their overall style is the (relatively) early days of modern hardcore, predating repetitive ""chug"" breakdowns. If these guys had continued, they would be regarded as one of the peers of Madball, no less.",1

"Actually deserves zero stars: This book is full of glaring errors, and the testing software is ABSOLUTELY USELESS. Everything in the tests is incorrect. You're given questions that ask you to ""select the two methods..."", but are only allowed to select one answer. In addition, the test data is just plain wrong. The software gives explanations for your supposed wrong answers that have absolutely nothing to do with the questions. Complete waste of money.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to learn anything about Sql Server 2000 or want to prepare for the test.",0

"Disappointed....very elementary: This book came highly recommended from a friend.I was very disappointed though.As many reviewers have stated, it would be an excellent introduction to Christianity or as a book to any4th or 5th grader.Theres really not much substance in it to the knowledge seeker.A few rehashed ideas, mixed with his opinions (largelyfundamental protestant). I know he is a pastor, but the writing style is very poor. Dont get me wrong, there are a few bright points such as expounding on ways to worship and anenlightening passage on meditation/prayer techniques.Just overall I was disappointed.He built up to this nugget of wisdom about midway through :""Almighty God wants to be your friend"".ugghhh. Hope he is able to use all the proceeds in a positive way though.",0
"Forgettable!: ""The Unforgettable Fire"" is a disappointing follow-up to their prior release, the sensational ""War."" There's not much on this album to recommend it as much of what's on here is bland and uninspiring, save ""Wire"" and the title track. A better alternative would be to get the video of this album as it shows what a creative force U2 was in the mid-1980's.",0
"Demystifying opera: I'm twenty-something and am cultivating a budding interest in opera. Matt's book was perfect for me. I have attended four operas so far equipped with prior knowledge of history of the particular opera, plot, performers, and breath mints thanks to Matt's book. YES he does share his opinions in his book - and face it, he has a right to do that. It IS his book afterall. Besides what fun is a totally objective look at art? Not much! De gustubus non est disputandem... matters of taste are not disputable. Nobody said Matt's opinion should be The Last opinion! Form your own and them share them!

"Oh PLEEEEZEE...: Nice idea, but the dialog was silly and trite, not to mention their was no plausible reason for creating this thing at all. The plot meandered all over the place and obviously there was little or no research into the science of biotechnology to support it. The film rushed through as quickly as it could with no real point to make except the same warning that was given to Victor Frankenstein with a bizarre sexual twist.. I don't see how this film created such a stir or that it even got produced.",0
Terrible smell: We purchased this table from amazon for our 2 1/2 year old. We set the box in our basement until we had a chance to assembleit and the next day our basement smelled awful. We opened the box and the smell is imbedded in the wood as well. Ourdaughter played with this table at a store and loved it but it smells so bad that I am not sure we can put in her room or in the house for that matter. I am extremely disappointed with it.,0

She just released a CD a couple of months ago... which was supposed to out do other fellow crossovers like Shakira and Paulina Rubio... and it FLOPPED! Shakira's crossover was amazing!

"Dark, unclear, and drowned in misery: This movie is dark and unclear. What happened anyway? You have some really miserable characters, some really evil ones who need to get dealt with. The evil they do is just suffered through, without a response. There's some sort of supernatural garbage going on, or maybe there isn't and maybe it is just some insanity. Booga booga. This movie wasn't for me. If you enjoyed it, good for you. I don't know why I'm not giving it just one star. Something about it was appealing, but it was drowned in misery. You like misery?",0

Great movie ties in well with the original trilogy: This was a good story line it expands on the trilogy and keeps open the possibilityof more films.great action!,1
"Absurd in the light of reality: Sixteen years after this was made, it is sort of amusing to see what ""someone in Hollywood"" thought would be a great morale booster in terms of displaying our military capabilities. Now that we know the reality of the situation of dealing with terrorists abroad, the flimsy premises of this tawdry little film seem even more ridiculous. But - at its core - it was an idiotic film then, and an even more idiotic film now.",0

The producers should be credited because when you bump this album in a car or in a stereo, they just tear the speakers down and shake the place up!

I am sure his next album will show growth and maturaty as an artist!Production: 10/10Lyrics: 8/10Overall: 9/10Keep it coming Fabolous and go cop this ghetto album!",1
"I wouldn't read it twice: Pretty superficial book, its principal content could be condensed into 30% of the original volume. One worrying finding: the author is extremely careless for a scientist in his interpretation of inheritance of IQ and the work of Sir Cyril Burt. It is reasonably clear now that the vicious attack on Burt was politically motivated. Provided that very substantial inheritance of IQ is now beyond technical dispute, author's undocumented blatant denial is of not much worth. My concern that when I see such an apparent flaw in argument on the topic of my knowledge, it raises unnecessary doubts about the book as a whole. Hopefully, such attitude is only a formal pledge of allegiance to ""anti-racist"" dogs who currently control the MSM.",0
it made me want to see it over and over again.: this film has touched me like only one other has and that was robinhood. this is a film that i will definately add to my personal collection so that i can enjoy it over and over.,1
"What a great series of cookbooks!: Another outstanding book compiled by Napa Valley author Leslie Mansfield (her husband is winemaker at Bradford Mountain). She takes recipes from wineries throughout Northern California and puts them in to nifty themed books. This one - Barbecue Dishes, is just one of the newest series of three books that includes Picnics and Vegetarian Dishes. The recipes are easy to read and execute and there is wine pairings reccomended with each dish. Also has a little background about each winery. Check some of the other books Leslie has produced and you won't be dissapointed.",1
"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD: THIS IS A HORRIBLE FILM. It is only 8 minutes long, with a monotone, boring person narrating. It is insulting and pointless.

"Decent, I like it: My absolute favorite brow product is from Lancome but we don't always have nearly $30 to spend on a eyebrow pencil (though they last a long time). I bought this to hold me over. Ultimately, I like it. My only problems are that, I wish the pencil was a bit larger and I wish the gel was a bit darker.I got dark blond and the pencil is fine but the brow-set gel seems to be a much lighter blond, so when it catches the light you can see the difference between where the pencil is and where the gel is - not a fan. Next time I'll probably nab a light brown and just be more gentle with the pencil and go heavier with the gel. The pencil is waxy but pigmented, which is great fora brow pencil and the gel holds all hairs in place. If you need an inexpensive brow kit, I'd get this. Though I also suggest using an angled brush and a matte eyeshadow of the right color to go over the pencil work before setting, though you could definitely just use this.",1
Cute toy: I really like this durable toy. It has bright colors and is made very well..i'm not worried my son will pinch his fingers or anything like that. I do agree with some of the other reviewers about it being a little too big for small babies..my son is 4mo and i don't believe he is quite ready for it. He can hold on to the Haba frog teether toy better.,1
"Design needs to be reworked: I bought these replacement heads for my Sonicare elite e7300. The first one broke within the first month's use. (One of the two metal legs that hold the magnet snapped.) The second head is working better, now that I've discovered why the first one broke. It appears that the head magnet is too close to the handle motor magnet. This causes the head magnet to vibrate loudly and eventually shear. The design flaw is either the magnet being too close or the plastic tighten cap not fitting properly.If you purchase these heads and the cap portion vibrates loudly, unscrew and re-screw the cap on until it doesn't vibrate so loudly. This will prevent the metal legs that hold the magnet from snapping.",0
"Close to the fire: After years of absence Kayak is back and how.... A great album of a great Dutch band, as if they never have been away. They deserve to be bought and listened to. Try their older albums of the seventies too. I think you won't be disappointed if you like prog-symphonic music.R-J's advise: make some time and listen to their music.",1
"Cheap look. Motion sensor is not sensible enough.: It was like a children's toy.The look was very cheap, and you have to be within 2 feet or so to be detected....I recommend nicer model, SVAT ISC200.It looks real, and I liked always blinking red LED.",0
An all-time favorite.: I first read this book when I was a child. It has always been one of my favorites. I cannot tell you how many times I have read Lorna Doone but I love it more each time.,1
TRENDnet 300Mbps Wireless N Broadband Router: Overall it is a lot better than the old Wireless-G (Linksys). Worked right off the box. Needs a little more time to enable the wep key which has not happened yet. Comes with a Netmanager software has a short trial period so plan on spending a little more if you need it.,1
"Save it for the Extended version: Do not believe people who says they don't care for the extended edition, obviously they lie! This is not some BS fantasy movie like In the name of the King, this is Lord of the Rings. It will worth every single cell that we can get. Do not buy and support this product, don't be a puppet!",0
Downton Abbey: This movie definitely keeps you glued to the TV. One of the most beautiful period movies I have ever seen. Wonderful cast of characters. Can't wait for the second series to be released.,1
"Good Bond film: For some, this film is the ultimate Bond film. For others, it is amongst the worst. For me, it was a decent film. It wasn't anything special, really. Amongst the great action sequences is a weak plot and underwhelming villains and henchmen. The whole time, I was thinking ""how the hell could this plan work?""",1

shark movie?: What the movie had verry litle to do with sharks only a few scences had some sharks but they only lasted 2 minutes the rest was people in the water talking about how they made a mistake coming on this boat from the comercials i was thinking how could they make a movie about people stranded in the sea it sounded like a short films you know the ones that last like thirty minutes i was wondering it dosnt sound verry action packed but i still got it and it was terrible.,0
"crap: worked great for a few months, then never worked again. Wouldn't even power up. Wasn't worth it to try and return it since I bought it online. It literaly sat on a desk and was only used a few times and rarely even touched. Garbage hardware. Complete waste of money.",0

"Not Reader Friendly: This book is hard on the eyes.I read part of it and gave up. All the graphs are printed in blue and uses different types of shading to show different regions. The font size is about 8 or 10. The size of the book is ackward more like what is suited towards an advertising pamphlet. Quite clearly, Penguin is being super cheap about printing this book. It was published in the last few years so I'm totally confused what's the issue here. I mean come on. I can print full color pages on my laser printer for about 3 cents a page. Why can't a big fancy publisher like Penguin do a decent job printing a book?Buy a different book, your eyes will thank you!",0
"Great book but..: This is a great book but it lacks scientific evidence and it rests it's theories on one experiment conducted by the author, the experiment itself was hardly done under the strict standards of the scientific community, he didn't even have a control group, by what is he comparing it with!! I can see why so many people can get sucked in by it but the empirical mind will see it for what it is. It does have intresting theories but with very little (if any ) concrete evidence.",0
"Bing Crosby: I love Bing's ""laid-bask"" style in these movies (and his voice is certainly a gift)! Ingrid is his match in this movie, she makes the part believable!",1
"New perspective on the legend of Robin Hood: This was a very good book. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was because I didn't really ""fall in love"" with the characters. I love books that give a new perspective on a story, especially if it is from a woman's point of view, and in this case Roberson does an excellent job. Very well researched and pieced together.",1
A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WITH AMBITION: I just finished reading the book and even with my MBA I was amazed that I hadn't tried several of Ms. Kushell's methods for meeting important people before. She writes with style and experience. This book definitely will pay for itself!,1
"half good, then violence against women no wonder he aint blow up: I loooove comedy, collect it, watch a ton, can take a joke, live in the hood so I understand the material- matter of fact, 2 people just got shot outside my window today- so I do know- this dvd is inappropriate, unnecessary and contributes to ideologies that provoke awful living situations and violence that plague our neighborhoods. These stereotypes are being reproduced and ""justified"" in a grotesque manner. His comments about Reeree and child support and measuring up to other ""brothers"" is incredibly disturbing. I try to support artists, but DO NOT buy this. Awful ending, he is self-defeating, self destructive, nothing at all compared to kings of comedy. He got issues, needs therapy NOT a stage.Peace.",0

It is not easy to read and certainly does not fit the dummie series.

"Couldn't put it down, except...: A rich, colorful and imaginative version of the Wicked Witch we grew up with. I couldn't put it down. It's a Harry Potter for adults -- unfortunately for adults only because of an unnecessarily pornographic section involving sex between, well never mind. Aside from the bestiality, a great read right to the end, where the plot veers awkwardly to fit the story we know. Tear out the study questions at the back of the book. They are annoying.",1
"great,but: This is my third wrist heart monitor. It performs well. I like the functions. It comes with fairly clear instructions and support material to help you with your exercise program.

"Absolute [..]: Undoubtedly, the worst cd of any kind (one positively cannot call it music) that I have ever purchased. I will not be as forgiving as others who might have rated it so. This cd is an exact example of someone, completely without talent, who happens to have clout enough to deliver a product. One song was played at the discotheque, one mediocre disco ditty. Unfortunately, some genius decided that the rest of the cd needed more of the same garbage. This recording takes redundancy to new levels of ad nauseam. All the audio on this cd is horrible, it is truly that bad.So, if you are interested in expanding your musical horizons and are looking for something unique, erotic, sensual, or sexual, search items such as; Erotic Rhythms From Earth--Govinda, Suck It and See--Various Artists, MCMXC A. D.--Enigma, or Karma--Delerium should do the trick for starters.",0
"Dreams Associated with Sleeping & it will put you to Sleep: Obviously I did not like this movie. It has some of my favorite artists and actors in it, but it just never took off. I was thinking that it would be something like ""Ray"", and be based upon the Supreme's motown hits, but the music was not fun and in short this was a boring film. I gave up on it with 20 minutes to go, something that I rarely do.",0
"Never had this before: I purchased this because I was trying to find a good sugar for my kombucha. I guess I've been spoiled by processed white sugar. This is different! It takes a while to dissolve even in recently boiling water. I guess the flavor is not really objectionable. I have not tried it in regular tea but I'll do that next. Because it is in a solid cone shape I imagine that I will have to experiment to figure out how much to use in a cup of tea. This is identified as the least processed, with the most benefits of all sugars. It is more expensive on other sites.",1
"A nice slice of 1983.: Being a child of the eighties, two of my favorite Jackson Browne songs are ""Lawyers in Love"" and ""Tender Is The Night"". Both pop gems, and both found here. And though the album is only 8 tracks, I like them all. ""On The Day"" and ""Downtown"" are both catchy, and ""Knock On Any Door"" and ""For A Rocker"" are just as good. Only 35 minutes in all, but it's a good 35. I'm sure he may have better albums out there, but this is a keeper for me.",1

Expensive and Still Causes Contstipation: I shelled out $35 for two weeks of supplements because they told me that the formula was more bioavailable and also does not cause constipation. Well I most definitely am constipated after taking this supplement. Also it tastes terrible. I'm taking it back for a refund and going for ferrous sulfate tablets.,0
"Product not as described: I was specifically looking for a longer baster and the 14.5"" quoted in the specifications is what drove my decision to purchase this product. The baster I received was only 10.5"" long (bulb to tip) which is among the smaller of the basters available.",0
"Sleep sheep: I love that this is a portable sound machine. I can strap it on my son's car seat and take it anywhere. The 45 minute timer is also a great feature. Most noise machines out there shut off after only 10-15 minutes...right about when my son is just drifting off, and the change in sound wakes him up. The noise device can be removed and you are left with a cute stuffed toy. I highly recommend this product.",1
Gift: All I can say it that it was a gift for a child that wanted it. I think the price was too high though.,1
"boring book: You can pass the class without this book as long as your instructor uses blackboard. Most useless book, boring to read, unexciting, common sense information, ans reads like a novel instead of a text book. It was cheaper than the campus price, but still not worth $5.00.",0
"TRIGUN ROCKS!!!!!!!: Trigun is a great anime. It has a great mysterious storyline that comes together in the end. The story focuses on Vash the Stampede, a man worth $$60,000,000,000. It is set on a desert planet that humans have taken refuge on, and everyone lives like it is the wild west. Vash is feared by many for destroying the city of July, but is actually a gentle hearted airhead. He is followed around by two insurance girls, Milly and Meryl, and a travelling priest who is also an ace gunman Nicholas D. Wolfwood. While the anime focuses on Vash and his super-human gun skills, Wolfwood is a more interesting character. Wolfwood has a mysterious past and was trained by a Gung-Ho Gun named Chapel the Evergreen (the Gung-Ho Guns are an evil gang under Vash's evil brother). His story is anonymous even after his death. I strongly recommend this great wild west/sci-fi anime.",1
"I didn't care for this book: This book didn't make that much sense to me as far as a plot goes. It was mainly pornography. I like steamy scenes as much as anybody but after a while, for me, the repeated sex got tiring. Merinus (not a very attractive name) was a contradiction. She claimed to be able to do the job of tracking down Callan Lyons and getting him to open up to her. She finally talks her stubborn brothers, who were major irritants, into letting her do this and then she proceeds to make so many blunders that it was hard to take her seriously. Perhaps this book wasn't the right one to read first as this is a series but the plot just wasn't there. There was a bit of disjointed story in between bouts of sex. I liked Callan but Merinus was also an irritant. There was just no meat to this story. If you like steamy sex scenes and plenty of them, then this is the book for you. If you like a plot too, then maybe this isn't one you'll enjoy.",0
"No Love: Manual very limiting. I brought my daughter this for Christmas, it was a nightmare trying to find compatible MP3 files that would actually work with the player. MP3 files that worked find on several different pcs on a cd-r disc wouldn't work with this player. No web support found, this was a disaster.",0
"Bought three, two have failed!!: I was introduced to Tivoli by my brother who had a early model PAL radio. Bought two SongBooks for myself and one as a gift for my father-in-law. Really not happy with these radios. The sound is mediocre at best and I would say better for listening to talk radio than music. The blue SongBook (I bought red and blue ones) has the worst sticky finish on it and its impossible to clean and feels disgusting to pick up. The REAL reason I have to give it such a low rating is failure rate. One of mine died completely and had to be shipped back to Tivoli. My father-in-laws did the same thing and they blamed it on a faulty power cord but would not ship him a new one until he shipped them the radio and cord for assessment (and the courier charge was not covered).Finally, don't let these radios sit in the sun as they overheat and shut down. We use them by our pool but have to put them in the shade under a chair or else they fail in about 30 minutes.I would not buy another.",0
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!: Tried many times on our two dvd players (toshiba & magnovox) to get this toy to work. I finally thought that I had it programmed on one player when 5 minutes into the game it quit working. My two children and myself are very disappointed in this FP toy. After the two games and the system was purchased I now have [...]. I wil try to return it.,0
BORING!!: We think that this book was remarkably boring. In the book Farwell to Manzanar a girl named Jeanne was sent to and relocation camp. She had a bad life there but was out of there after a few years and also had some trouble outside the camp. This book was not as exciting as I had expected. You might learn a few things in the book but it could be put in a different way and could be more interesting.,0

"I actually read this book :-): After reading some of the caustic comments posted regarding this book, I thought it might be useful for people to hear a different viewpoint.I read this book after borrowing it from a co-worker to get an overview of offshore outsourcing. After attending a lot of internal meetings where managers throw out various buzzwords like BPO, ITO, near-shoring, offshoring etc. I needed a primer that had a lot of examples and case studies.I found the book useful in terms of providing a basic foundation in terms of what was going on. Was the book perfect, no. Was the book upto date in 2005, no. Did it provide a basic education and overview, yes. Did it provide some guidelines if you were to implement outsourcing, yes.",1

This album begins where her 4 tracks from COYOTE UGLY left off.....it is Rimes dream to make a pop album of all different styles....she has done it! What a great cd it is!!! The catchy and upbeat LIFE GOES ON is a testimonial to where she is at.....legal problems with her father embezzling money from his own daughter, legal problems with her record company, becoming a woman....she deserves so much credit for handling this with dignity and coming back with an album she executive produced...plus she had a hand in writing a handful of the tracks...we have funk in TIC TOC...we have the power ballads...THE SAFEST PLACE, DAMN, YOU MADE ME FIND MYSELF...lots of upbeat numbers too.....if you loved her COYOTE UGLY songs....buy this one and experience her divine gift of song!

"Good product, but not this batch...: My wife has been using this product for several years to good effect, and just ordered her first tube from Amazon due to its great price. Bad move - this batch is staining everything ""Highlighter Yellow"": the bedclothes, her clothes, her skin, etc. It took us almost 2 weeks to determine that it was the Pro-Gest that was the culprit. If you are ordering this from Amazon for the first time, we recommend you try it out first to ensure it doesn't stain. If it does, return it before 30 days are up in order to get a full refund.",0
"Useful: South Indian cooking is quite different from North Indian cooking. The spices are different and, although not entirely vegetarian, there is much less use of meat.The book has a refreshingly practical approach in a market that seems increasingly dominated by foody-porn. There are no glossy, full page photographic spreads. Instead, you'll find a simple collection of recipes and hints and real-world advice on preparing the staples of South Indian cusine, idlis, dohsa, sambar, various appetizers, bahjis, rice dishes, and a few meat dishes. The instructions are clear. A nice feature of these recipes is that they mostly tend to use different combinations of the same dozen or so staple ingredients, easily found in an Indian grocery.I have enjoyed everything I've prepared from this book. I would recommend it to anyone, like me, who enjoys South Indian food and is looking for a practical introduction.",1

"Television's Best Drama Series...: ...in many years. Eleventh Hour rivaled CSI for hard-hitting, edge-of-your-seat drama, while the smaller, more intimate cast had a chemistry more intense than any found in a laboratory. Dealing with 'science fact' rather than science fiction, Eleventh Hour deals with many of the major issues in science today, including stem cells, human cloning, cryogenics and nanotech. Endlessly fascinating, it is a series that could - and should - have had many long years on television.",1
"Excellent book for experienced poeple!: If you are a programming beginner,this is not a good book for you.But if you have already known couple languages and wanna master in Javascript,this is an excellent reference.The authors squeezed the programming syntaxes into one chapter and provided a comlepte set of function reference.It saved me a lot of time and gave me what I really wanna know.This book is totally written in programmer's view. So there are not many design patterns and applications for you.However you can solve this problem by going to check out the on-line source codes.There are couple bugs inside this book.But that did bother me much,if you have experiences on programming you can fingure it out.That is why I substraced one star on the scale!",1

"Subtle comedy classic: What happens to a cheating husband who oddly happens not to be married?? A charming script featuring a bright blue-eyed Goldie Hawn, an elegant Ingrid Bergman and a surprisingly dashing Walter Matthau. Diamond's screenplay sparkles with wit and keeps the emotional dynamics in constant spin. The small ensemble carried this stage play on screen with confidence and energy. Matthau excels again at dumbfounded facial gynastics while Ingrid holds together the love triangle and blooms in the end. A simple yet sassy affair!",1

The chopsticks are nice as well, but I thought they would be more of a keepsake item instead they are just nice chopsticks.",1
"Superfly nerd!: Who's this guy trying to fool? What's with the whole superfly funk act? I have listened to this album front to back, there are maybe two so-so songs, not worth the money.

"Puff piece by a writer with an interest in Amway's success: This book is a standard inclusion in many Amway ""lit packs"" given out to new prospects. With this in mind, do you think Mr. Conn has an unbiased, evenhanded view of a company whose existence has helped him sell many hundreds of thousands of books? I think not. The book is thorough, and includes lots of background information about Amway and its founders, Rich DeVos and Jay Van Andel. But it may as well have been written on Amway stationery for all the objectivity it provides. Mr. Conn (an unfortunately ironic surname for the author of an Amway book) sure knows how to succeed in the publishing world...write a glowing review of this ""exciting business opportunity"" without discussing any of the cautions new distributors or prospects need to know. This book gets only one star because Amazon.com doesn't go as low as zero.",0
"Shipment Never Arrived: These balls were recommended to my class by our yoga instructor. This brand and no other. So I ordered enough for the class. There was some issue with the shipping, which after talking to the company, they had reason to believe all or many of their shipments were incorrect that day. I called days after shipment should have arrived. The customer service representative was great, but couldn't do much. The lost product was now out of stock and then backordered. After waiting another week and a half (and getting flack from my class), I called back and the items were now backordered because their stock didn't arrive on time. I asked for and easily received a refund, but that didn't help my case.Moral of the story - apparently it is a great product, but the company has some logistics to iron out. Pay attention to the quantities and ""arrive by"" dates.",0
"Size matters: I ordered this product from a third-party partner. While the tank was of excellent quality, there is a distinct sizing issue with the product. I ordered a medium, but could barely get it over my shoulders. Once I had it on, it was like being encased in a sausage skin. Since there is no sizing information on Amazon or at Athletica's site, I decided to send it back for a refund rather than take a chance and exchange it for a larger size (I sincerely doubt that a ""large"" would have fit either, given the cut of the product). This is the first time that I have ever had to send anything back, and am very disappointed. In addition to the size issues, Athletica did not report back to Amazon that it had received or fulfilled my order in a timely fashion, so Amazon sent me an ""alert"", encouraging me to contact the vendor directly. Then, it took Athletica two weeks to credit back my charge account, which occurred only after I submitted a claim through Amazon. A total fiasco.",0

"Where's the beat?: In a quest to own all of the available EJ albums, I purchased this about four years ago. What can I say? I certainly don't begrudge him for trying disco, after all, that is one thing that sets Elton apart from the others, his ability to successfully hit with so many different styles, however...this was a failed attempt. Maybe had he actually written at least one note of the music, this wouldn't have bombed so bad, who knows. There are a couple songs that start out ""almost"" promising, but then begin to sound just like the one before. However, there is one song, that in my opinion, is not that bad..""Johnny B. Goode"", yes, it is a far cry from the classic Chuck Berry version, but if you just listen, and don't take it that serious, it's so off the wall, it's almost catchy..a ""guilty pleasure"", as most disco was. However, the rest of the album is just plain guilty, and only neccessary if you are like me, and attempting to own all the albums.",0
"Don't bother with this: I sent the Saitek A-250 back to Amazon within two weeks of opening the box. It never worked as advertised. None of the function buttons (fast forward, rewnd, pause, etc.) worked on the unit, no matter which media player I used; I tried both Windows Media Player and Music Match, two of the most common music players out there, to no avail. The range of the unit was fairly limited in my house, less than 30' from the transmitter base. However, the worst part was the horrible popping and hissing sounds which came out of the speakers at twice the volume of the actual music playing. I thought this would be a cool way to enjoy the digital music from my PC around the house, but the combination of poor sound quality was so poor and nonfunctional technology had this back in the box and returned to Amazon shortly after the holidays. The design of the unit is cool and the idea is perfect, but the execution is completely flawed.",0

Of course, Jamie didn't see it that way because, well, when flying over a house, one's mind drifts - but perhaps we all drift (even when eating pizza) to somewhere over the rainbow beyond the metaphysical boundaries of common literature...WHAM! The motorcycle skidded on the poor beetle and flipped over, causing a thermonuclear explosion and a time dilation which made Star Trek into reality (yes, Kirt was interviewed by Oprah, seriously). The cockroach survived - as cockroaches do, especially in times of nuclear war (just ask archie) - but how about that pizza? Hot, dude, real hot, even without jalapenos... Need I continue?",0

"Disappointment- Why Mr Jordan needs to get his act together: I have gone beyond disappointment and into the realm of being irked. Like others I waited a long time for this latest installment to come out and like the others I was totally disappointed. I concur with the previous writer who said this series started going down hill around book 6.The plot goes nowhere. I'm at a loss to determine if it's Mr Jordan, or his editor that deserve the blame for this. The second time I read the book, I read thru it to determine why I didn't like it and I've figured out why. It appears that Mr Jordan has decided to put 3 to 5 paragraphs of descriptive scenary for every line of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, the vibrant descriptions of the WOT are a key element, but in this case it's over the edge.Maybe he's getting paid by the word. You could have put the entire story down in 1/3 of the space. I'm not buying another one of his works in hardcover, I'll wait until they come out in paperback from here on out.",0
"Mysterious killer with an axe.: Antonio Sabato Jr is the best actor in this film. It has a really stupid plot and ending. It's about a killer with an axe that offs his victims one by one. The motive behind this is that the spiky haired kid in this film is mistreated by all his classmates for his weird seance's and evil cults. His behavior is so strange that he makes the guidance counselor very nervous. After getting run off the road by one of his schoolmates, all his old classmates die one by one by this mysterious killer. While in the meanwhile, Antonio Sabato Jr (the detective) in this movie investigates and does a polygraph on everyone. There is not that much gore or nudity in this film and the ending was very bizarre. It was completely stupid.",0
"Good water quality, but the normal water stream is far too small: I just bought a set of the product and fitted it with my faucet. The filtered water stream is very small which I can accept.But when I let the water flow the un-filtered stream, the water stream is same as the filtered one.I have to spend much longer time to wash my dishes. I checked the design, no way to change this, it is designed like that. Both stream use the same small whole to flow out.Eventually I have to dismount this filter from my faucet, really can't tolerate so ridiculously small water stream for washing dishes.How come nobody mention/complain this?",0
"too much to enjoy: Alexander Rou has done many fairy tales/folk tales but, to me, he is a poor director. This film is overacted and overproduced. It is part fairy tale, farce, musical and vaudeville. It just doesn't jell. For Russian audiences only.",0
"Zur...go back to the drawing board: Greetings, I just wanted to share a bit of my experience in reading Zur's novel. Firstly, his young age is really evident in this text. I find his prose to be a rather amateur endeavor, and I just couldn't appreciate his story because of this. Secondly, this book is listed as dealing with a youth who is fed up with the predictable life. Nice premise for the millionth time. I would be more interested to see how a rebellious youth dealt with such a predicable book, like Zur's. Zur, nice attempt, but maybe hit the books for a few more years and come back in sometime. One positive note: this novel is far better than those ridiculous poems he published. They were like Seuss meets depressed Marilyn Manson fan. Life isn't that hard...you live in America.",0
"Do not buy it: I just bought one last week. Over the weekend I tried it from Middletown,NJ to Philadelphia Zoo. I expected it should guide me to Zoo using Major Highway. Instand, it guided me to destination through center of Philadelphia city(I do set option using interstate high way option). When I came back from Zoo, it guided me a very strange route to home. Although I did not get lost, I looked the map, it went with a traingle to bright me back.At that night, I read the manual again. I tried the route plan option. It can not show what route it is supposed to go. You can not review the route plan. I think any one can grap a map and points the much better route than this navigator. So, If you want to buy this navigator, I do not know it can really help you.",0
Something Fishy.: I'm always looking for new fun fitness dvd's. When I saw this new DVD I wanted to check it out. Every reviewer has such great things to say I wanted to see what their other reviews were like. Not one had any other review other than this DVD. This just doesn't seem right. I guess I won't be ordering this DVD until I see some real reviews.,0
"Episodes missing: I was incredibly disappointed that this set did not include the first four episodes of the season.

"This is horrible...Buy the CD with Pavarotti and Freni: This CD was horrible. It was not worth the money to buy. If you are looking for amazing singing, purchase the London version starring Lucciano Pavarotti and Mirella Freni. Also, if you want to see a performace of La Boheme in New York, don't go to La Boheme on Broadway. See La Boheme at the Metropolitan Opera House. It is worth the money. The set is beautifully done by Franco Zefferelli and the singing is much better than the Broadway production. The chlidren in the produciton at the Met are also extroadinay and very talented for their ages.",0
"Beware: not the original version: Before someone else has to learn the hard way, I wanted to point out that this is NOT the original theatrical release of Modern Times, but the hack-job edited version Chaplin put together later in his career to appeal to the resurgence crowd. It's rather shameful that this isn't noted on the packaging. If that's is the version you prefer, than you'll be happy. The restoration is lovely, and most of the edited parts are available as bonus features. But for those who want to see this film as it was original released, it's best to look elsewhere.",0

Give This One a Pass: Tiresome repitition marks this novel. Enduring the imaginings of the protagonist to no valid conclusion is beyond irksome.
