0,"This is the best novel I have read in 2 or 3 years.  It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop ""my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me"" trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are.
Anyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature.
I was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...
I hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work."
1,"Pages and pages of introspection, in the style of writers like Henry James.  I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and ""truths"" within the story.

It's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read."
2,"This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.

Potential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.

The focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.

Sagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.

 It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.

For me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family."
3,"What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism.
The story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it!"
4,"I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the ""bildung?""  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.
I do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.
If you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend."
5,"I read this probably 50 years ago in my youth and I just re-read it for the first time.  It was a fun read but not as good as my memory of it.

6,"I read every Perry mason book voraciously. Finding the Lam/Cool mysteries, and getting to enjoy more of Gardner's characters, is like Christmas morning as a kid. Each book is a gift!"
7,I love this series of Bertha and Lamb..  Great novels.
8,Great read!
9,"Crows Can't Count, A.A. Fair

Mr. Harry Sharples came to the Cool & Lam Agency; he was a co-trustee for a trust fund that will terminate when the youngest beneficiary turns 25. One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn't but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).

Lam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).

Lam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and ""the delightful Senora Cool"" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia."
10,"Fresh from Connecticut, Taylor Henning lands a dream job at a major movie studio. Okay, so she's not a Creative Executive whose job it is to read and recommend screenplays for the studios to produce. No... she's just an assistant to the assistant of the powerful Iris Whitaker, President of Production.

When first assistant Kylie Arthur sabotages Taylor at the first opportunity she almost gets fired. That's when Taylor realizes that Hollywood is just like high school. If you're not in, no one wants to be your friend.

In order for Taylor to survive in this environment she enlists the help of Iris' sixteen year old daughter Quinn. Irritated to no end Quinn nevertheless takes on the challenge and begins texting Taylor ""rules"" to get ahead in the cut throat world of the movie business and amazingly enough her tips are working! That is until Quinn's next rule is to steal Kylie's boyfriend. Torn between doing the right thing and securing her real dream job Taylor has some tough decisions to make.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book!! It was so much fun. Yes it did remind me a lot of The Devil Wears Prada but Taylor became a cherished character and I very much wanted her to succeed. I even loved the snarky Quinn. She was a spoiled brat but she had a good heart and I was rooting for her too. This is a fun breezy read that I recommend to all chick lit lovers."
11,"I don't know about you but I would hate to have to go through high school again. All the cliques and having to worry about trying to see if you could become popular makes me shudder to even think about it. That's why I could never even think of applying for a job like Taylor. It's sad to say that I probably wouldn't last very long. What I really liked about Taylor is that even though she works in Hollywood, and has the untimely job of being a second assistant, she's not ditzy. She's really quite smart and knows about the actual movie industry even though she's not too knowledgeable about the hierarchy about moving up.  I really liked learning about scripts and background knowledge myself.  It makes the movie industry become more real when you know this stuff and not just like some magical wonderland.  Taylor is also realistic and relatable. This book does not having annoying slang thrown around by characters and there's not really that much name or label dropping.

It's funny seeing her battle wits with Kylie with each trying to outdo and slam down the other. Although Quinn appears to be of help to Taylor, it's also a testament to the lack of parenting that goes on in the industry.  I'm really not a fan of how teens can do all these things, ruin people's lives and then get completely away with it. The only qualm is that this is a storyline that has been done numerous times. Almost every chick flick that takes place in a magazine setting has done this plot. Therefore you know exactly what's going to happen. However the story is so engaging and the plot is witty and funny that it really doesn't matter and you get sucked up into the the lives of the characters.

If you are looking for a great book to bring to the beach this is it. It's a fun read that totally helps you to escape from the normal routines of daily life and brings you to the glamorous world of the rich, famous, and beautiful. I wish this book was part of a series because I would love to learn more about Taylor's life and the world of Hollywood cliques. HIGHLY recommended."
12,"Obviously the premise of this book first struck me as a knockoff of The Devil Wears Prada. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to discover that this was not another tale of assistants putting up with impossibly awful bosses; rather, Taylor's boss was not the problem - she's the kind of classy lady you would want to work for - instead it was Taylor's fellow assistant who turned out to be the complete psycho.

Taylor's character wasn't wildly appealing, but the story was funny, fast-paced and truly captured the lives of many assistants. I was interested, I wanted Taylor to prevail over her seemingly-insane roommate and her shallow judgemental co-workers - even when the story took some unrealistic turns, I was rooting for Taylor to win. I definitely recommend this book as a quick and fun summer read."
13,"I am very happy that I have never been a fan of the ""Hollywood"" scene or that I never found myself ""needing"" to go Hollywood - because if I base myself on the novels I have been reading about Hollywood, this is NOT a place that I want to be.

In Hollywood is Like High School with Money, we discover that Taylor Henning has, unfortunately, been bitten by the mighty Hollywood bug as she finds herself in the lowest of all the positions (or is that security guard at the gate?).  She is an assistant and she is desperately trying to move on up in that world.  Enter some competition/potential BFF??? - especially Quinn who is loaded with advice, but is she giving it to help Taylor or destroy her?

This novel, which I thought was a fun and devilish read is loaded with true moments of what I would call some true Hollywood horror experiences and stories - as Taylor struggles to stand above it all, she finds herself caught in two worlds - that of her conscious and that of the real Hollywood scene.  What does a sweet, innocent (but quickly becoming less innocent by the minute) girl do to get ahead?  stick by her beliefs or become one of the backstabbers.

I loved that the author explores this issue in an honest and fortright manner - especially through the character of Quinn - which I pretty much hated for much of the book, but also thought was pretty true to the storyline.

This book made me want to scream at Taylor to run far away, but at the same time, I wanted to keep reading to get more ""dish"" on the whole scene.

One of those great beach read/end of summer books that you love to read."
14,"""Hollywood is Like High School with Money"" by Zoey Dean is a charming story about trying to break into the film business and staying there without getting stabbed in the back. Again, another story about Hollywood I had to read; but this time from the viewpoint of an assistant (the lowest of the lowest in that world). This one is funny and quirky and an easy read. Certainly, a good book to escape to the beach with!"
15,"Synopsis:

Taylor Henning started her dream job at a major Hollywood studio. For as long as she can remember, Taylor has loved movies. The reclusive director Michael Deming and his seminal work Journal Girl have been a particular inspiration for Taylor. Although she's never received a response, Taylor sends Deming updates on her Hollywood experience.

Taylor soon finds that life as a second assistant involves small tasks and not the selection and producing of ""great films,"" at least to start. But more than the type of work, it's her co-workers that make Taylor miserable. It's like high school all over with the popular girls and their mean tricks. Taylor's too much of a nice girl to acclimatize. Outwitted one too many times by first assistant Kylie and with her job at risk, Taylor asks Quinn, her boss's popular teenage daughter, for tactical advice. It's not about being mean. It's about being confident. Not taking anyone's @#$%...Fake it till you make it...Speak up in class. When you're quiet, you're invisible...Make 1 cool friend...Lunch is a battleground...Enlist a faithful assistant. Taking Quinn's advice, Taylor wins victories against Kylie.

As Taylor starts to come into her own, a creative executive position opens up. Competing against Kylie and the other assistants for the promotion, Taylor proves willing to use darker methods to advance.

Review:

Hollywood is Like High School With Money is the first Zoey Dean novel that I've read. Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully. It may be that I'm inured to violence and too sensitive to female bullying, but when I got to where Kylie was setting the first trap for Taylor, I found the tension unbearable. I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn't put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.

Overall, Hollywood is Like High School With Money is a light, satisfying read. I highly recommend it as a fun escape.

16,"This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.  The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V."
17,Worked out of the box with my cable box in northern California. Better than the original. It was easy to program for the tv too.
18,"I have an older URC-WR7 remote and thought this would be an upgrade (and because TWC stuck me with it), but this one fails where the other one didn't.  The old remote could go head to head and learn.  I have 2 different Blu Ray players (LG & Panasonic) and this one fails on both.  It cannot learn buttons.  The biggest problem is in streaming when I need to hit the blue, red, yellow, green buttons.  These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning."
19,Works great!
20,Cool
21,"Came with a ""bright house networks"" logo, but worked on Time Warner box perfectly."
22,very nice....
23,Works great
24,"First time I've EVER had a remote that needed no programming whatsoever so I have to give it bragging rights.  All the other 8780Ls I've had certainly had to be set up first.

Yes I wish it was Silver or White or some color that would permit its buttons to be more easily read but its thinner in hand than the ATLAS OCAP 5-Device Cable Remote Control 1056B03 so its the best thing I can find for a Samsung DVR with Samsung TV on the TWC system in NY."
25,volume buttons do not work.
26,Got them and only 2 of them worked. company called me after the feedback and told me they would send me a refund. The 2 that are working are doing fine. I like the lighted feature a lot for the night time.
27,Works like it should
28,"I got tired of the remote being on the wrong side of the bed. I was going to buy a generic remote when I got the idea to look for the real thing.  For a few bucks more I got this one. It is the same one as Time Warner gives you, works exactly the same, don't have to relearn anything."
29,Volume buttons were dead on arrival. be aware of possible defects!!
30,Works fine easy to program
31,Perfect backup for existing TWC remote
32,"This remote is the perfect solution for controlling my TWC cable box with DVR and my Visio TV, Sony Blu-ray player and Denon AVR. It was easy (15 - 20 minutes) to program the remote to control all this equipment. Still need to use my Visio remote to access Netflix and Amazon Video, but otherwise the TWC remote works great!"
33,excellent!  delivery was immediate.
34,"Came on time, fair price, and comparatively easy to set up. TWC took the old one and would not return it, and their ""replacement"" clicker is useless. This works fine!"
35,worked. cheap.
36,Works just like the rental unit supplied by the cable company.  In fact it is identical.  Just what I was looking for.
37,great
38,awesome product
39,"I love the remote, my old remote was going bad and I looked everywhere trying to find something, finally I decided to look online and I found the exact same kind, and they work great with my tv, I got one for my parents also. Great remote."
40,GREAT PRICE... GREAT REMOTE
41,"An excellent product/price, and super-fast shipping."
42,"It's ok. Feels somewhat awkward in hand. SMALL buttons on the bottom, great if your an elf."
43,Perfect replacement for the last one my dog chewed up. It works perfect and even came with some cheap batteries. It arrived quickly and was double packed inside a heavily padded envelope. Will buy again if my dog gets ahold of this one!
44,Had to replace my old TWC remote as some of the buttons wouldn't work. This is a bit upgraded and works just as good
45,My old Time Warner remote was causing me to pull my hair out. Bought this and has worked like a charm. All along I thought my TWC box was to blame and all I had was a defective remote. Should TWC have provided me a replacement? Yes. But this was much faster and works great.
46,"It works. It's interesting, I got one assembled in Mexico and it recently started to not work without a hard push on the buttons.

This one, identical in every way, is assembled in Korea. Seems to be better made.

Go figure.

But, it works,,,, I am happy"
47,IT WORKS WONDERFUL.........
48,"Works just fine, quick delivery."
49,Saved a bundle buying this from Amazon and not the cable company.  Works great!
50,It works but the button layout is terrible.  Half the time the wrong button gets pressed - annoying.
51,I purchased this product not to use in commerical trucking but rather to use when I am traveling with my 5th wheel RV.  So far this product as been very good.  Rand McNally folks seem to be working to continue to improve the software along with prompt updates.  Although designed for the trucking industry it works great for us RV folks as well.  I found for a 2500 HD pickup the unit is a little large for the windshield.  I use the unit with a mount that fits in my cup holder and that has worked out great.  I would recommend this product.
52,"Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.

Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.

Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.

 Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI's

To sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.

pros:
Large screen
terrific images
outstanding volume

cons:
inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and vias
a somewhat outdated POI information.
Non-truck specific routings.
Cost."
53,"This is a great truck GPS. I've tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.

Excellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.

I'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.

My complaints are relatively minor:

Battery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.

The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.

There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot. Annoying.

Clean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.

54,"My brother is a trucker and pre-ordered this.  He was out on the road when it arrived, so he asked me to charge it, update it, and play with it.  FUN!  I am not a trucker, but from what I hear from my brother, the tools on this device are awesome.  It looks like it would be very helpful for him.  The thing is huge, a 7"" screen!  Overall, this seems to be a great tool.

My problem with it is that it cannot update.  I have a brand new computer running Windows 7 64 bit.  It's a Dell Studio XPS 8100 (i5 processor).  After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into ""connected"" mode when it's plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (""Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)"").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.  I am hoping that it will update on my brother's XP laptop. we'll see when he gets back home."
55,Works great when I tape up  the plug to the port. I see why this was for sale.  Other than that it works fine.
56,Did not work. I'm sure the seller knew this before he shipped it. Out dated and cannot be used at all. Those are words from the manufacturer.
57,No up dates after 3 years!
58,It was great.
59,"We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the ""trucker"" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!"
60,"I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.

My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.

61,"I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7"" GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7"".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8"" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6"" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7"" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said ""Construction Ahead"" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.  Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy."
62,"Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units."
63,Daughter thought it was a good read.
64,"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth. It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages. Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.

At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father, I found this book particularly captivating. My father talked about the elephants, the native Kachin, Chindit, Naga, and Burmese peoples, the Imperial Forces, native built bashas, and the jungle and its wildlife. At 90, Dad also found the book quite riveting.

68,great book
69,"I am using this with our very high 4th grade students and they are loving the book.  I found a resource online that is helping them analyze the characters/setting/themes/etc. and learn about foreshadowing and flashback. They are enjoying the story because it isn't just another WWII story about the Nazis.  Instead, it is WWII when Japan invated Burma."

71,"I bought this for a school assignment for my grandchild who is not that excited about reading. Well, she couldn't put it down. I spoke to the teacher and she said all the kids are really enjoying it. It's a great book for a tween boy or girl."
72,"I think we read this with our son in 3rd grade and again in 5th.  For a boy it is wonderful, with WWII history, an exotic locale, adventure, danger, rampaging elephants and more.  A wonderful and very accessible coming of age story.  We've read 3 or 4 of Smiths books -- a great ""go to"" author for kids in the upper elementary age group."
73,"I highly recommend Elephant Run, by Roland Smith. Elephant Run is set during World War II in Burma, which is located in Southern Asia. The main character is 14-year-old Nick Freestone who lived in London, England. After Nick's parents' apartment was destroyed during the German bombing of London, Nick's mother and father both decided it would be safest to send Nick to Burma to stay with his dad on a plantation to get away from the bombing.

After a few days in Burma, the Japanese forces attacked their plantation, taking Nick's father as a prisoner of war, leaving Nick to stay with the rest of the Burmese who were given the choir of building an aircraft hanger for the Japanese. Nick finds a way to escape with the help of a Burmese monk of high importance. The monk's niece joined them on their escape. Once they had left the plantation without being spotted, they hitched a ride on a couple of elephants and rode them over to the prison site where Nick's dad was being held.

Thanks to the help of a Japanese friend, Nick's dad was able to escape, too. While all four of them were escaping, two guards who were patrolling the prison gates spotted them. The elephant that had assisted Nick on his journey to the prison camp saw that the guards were wearing tiger pelts around their necks. The elephants, thinking that they were a threat because of the tiger pelts draped around their necks, charged the guards and killed them. Nick, his dad, and the monk's niece all were able to find refuge from the war in Australia.

I thought that Elephant Run was a great book.  It was very suspenseful and it held my attention all the way through. I think that anyone would enjoy this book, especially people who are interested in learning about World War II."
74,I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  It was pretty exciting and a fun read.
75,"I am seriously wondering if I read the same books as everyone else.  I began reading with high hopes for two great thrillers based on other reviews, but I was sorely disappointed.  First of all, the sentence structure was choppy, with many sounding as of they were written by my eight year old.  Secondly, in an ill-conceived effort at humor, the protagonist comes off like a self-righteous jerk--and a sexist one at that.  Third, there were so many spelling and grammatical errors in the kindle edition (""accept"" instead of ""except""--twice, by the way...) that I wanted to take a red pen and edit the book myself!  Both books made for an interesting afternoon read, but the second book's big ""shocker"" I had pegged as soon as the character was introduced!  Overall, I was not impressed, but I will read the third book just to see where the story goes."
76,Nice mix of mystery and humor.  Good book to read on vacation.  Characters (and they really are) are interestingly developed.
77,"Never met a book by J. R. Rain I did not Love!
The uber cocky, uber endearing Knighthorse
Is someone u want to know and befriend. The whole side story with him and ""God""  is a surprisingly funny,  thought provoking ongoing conversation,  that I hope continues.  Great read!!"
78,I loved this book but then again I love all the books I have read so far by J. R. Rain.
79,I love these Jim Knighthorse. It was a good deal for 2 great books. I worthwhile read for all readers.
80,A good read! I would read it again if I had time. A lot of adventure and excitement. Great read for on the train.
81,"Writers who crank out as many books as Mr. Rain have always amazed me.  I am also amazed that mostly women read his books.  Nothing wrong with reading about blood suckers and ex-football players right guys?  Okay, I digress, back to the Knighthorse book review.  I enjoy sarcasm.  I employ it often and well.  Reading a book involving mayhem, murder and sarcasm is quite enjoyable.  I have purchased the 3-pack of Knighthorse and found a recurring theme in each book.  If the next book also has the sameness, I will be disappointed. I did enjoy the three pack."
82,"These two books have two very well told stories without killing you with useless details or scenes that don't really contribute.  Both books were fun to read although I enjoyed Dark Horse the most.  The author has a knack for the ""one line zingers"" in each story and the charachters have cockiness about them that is almost comical, but at the same time, that adds to the fun of reading the stories.  Well Done!!"
83,"I received my purchase in perfect condition, The packaging was in great shape, and the product is brand new. You can tell that it is new because it is a bit stiff when you open it, as is any new book. Very happy with this product and would definitely buy again at this price."
84,It's great
85,"We're rough on cables, often breaking them at the connection after a few months. This one eliminates that as a possibility, and a year later, we still haven't broken it!"
86,Good condition
87,"After purchasing cheap cords from another website, I was a little scared to purchase. So glad I did though!  It works great and the design will keep the cord from breaking so easily. Price is still kind of high for a power cord but it is worth it."
88,Bought for someone else.
89,Excellent cover. Very fancy and looks great on my Nook
90,Very quality build. Exterior point of view look great but slightly to thick
91,This is a great charging cable for the Nook.  It is way better than the one that came with the original Nook Color.  The only downside is you cannot use it on the computer to add books to your Nook.  This was not an issue for me because I have other cables for that.
92,Should of been given to Nook customers who had to replace their cord. This one works great.
93,Finally we can charge the nook again!
94,Great deal. The same case that was 40.00 at the BN store. Get this.
95,very nice item
96,"Since B&N no longer carry the Nook Color, or the cases... this one is actually better and cheaper than what I had originally bought from B&N."
97,works great with nook color
98,"The 90 degree connector is a bonus that allows her to read while it is charging without the older style straight connector sticking down.  This cable does everything including charging, and data transfer, works just as well as the original that came with her Nook Color, but better."
99,Great solution to original power cord.  New design gives the cord a better position so that it won't twist and wear out.  Seems to be well made and has stood up to daily use without an issue.
100,"This is the original case that would have been sold at the time of the product being offered in the store.  The case package was heavier than the nook itself...well made case, well made box, awesome.  And for the price, you cannot go wrong."
101,"Works perfectly, better than the original cable."
102,"Would love to give it 5 stars, but the ONE and only thing missing from this is that the charging indicator light doesn't work.  The biggest positive about this is that the connection to the Nook itself, is MUCH more ""beefy"" than the standard Nook charging cable.  B&N should have to supply each and every Nook owner with one of these free of cost due to their incredibly poor design of the standard cable that comes with the unit itself.  This is at least the fourth charger cable we have bought and I am hoping that it is the last."
103,It is a shame that Barnes and Noble didn't make theirs as well as this one
104,Works great for my kids' old Nook Color tablets.  This seems to be a much better design than the original cable that was extremely flimsy.
105,works like the original cable just better with the angle.
106,Works perfectly
107,Works great
108,This is the charging cable that should have come with the Nook in the first place. 100x better than the one that fell all to pieces.
109,Like the new design as it is more sturdy than the original charger.  Perfect!
110,this was a perfect fit for the older Kindle.
111,"It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat, compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesn't run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hub

It does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging. I guess it's better to have it at the plug."
112,"Works well, a little pricey I think for a charging cable, but then again, not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement"
113,"My son crewed my HD charger cord so I needed another one, this is exactly like the one my son destroyed."
114,"This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+)."
115,"I bought this thinking it would be a great replacement for my worn power cable.  It charged my nook HD+ and my son's nook for a few weeks and then my son said it stopped working.  Sure enough, I did not even get 6 months of use out of it even though it was an original cable (it came in an OEM box).

I ended up borrowing my mom's charger and charging my Nook HD+.  I then wiped the device and will put the Nook app on a generic Samsung tablet.  My Nook HD+ still works, but given all of the new Android exploits, lack of third party chargers that can last as long as the original, and the fact Barnes and Noble no longer supports it I cannot see keeping it any longer when newer tablets are faster."
116,This product has been working well still and I would definitely purchase from them again.
117,Perfect
118,"It works!  I was skeptical about ordering it because the ratings weren't great, but short of buying a new Nook or replacing it with a Kindle,  it was the best short-term option.  The original plug-in part made a sizzling sound one night and stopped working.  My husband tried to plug the USB end into one of about 20 USB to plug-in wall chargers that we have around the house and none of them worked.  We're assuming there must be some proprietary thing with the Nook USB end that won't let you use generic wall chargers which really sucked because he couldn't use his Nook for weeks.  If you are contemplating purchasing a Nook,  it may be something to take into consideration."
119,Works very well.
120,"I bought this so I could carry it with me and recharge my Nook when I am out and about. It works very well for that. The prongs of the charger fold down, so they don't tear holes in my bag or anything in the same pocket with it. The charging cable is plenty long enough to reach the outlet at my local coffee shop. It's an official product, so I don't have any worries about it overheating my Nook and causing a fire like knockoff brands can. And if anything happens to my everyday charger, I know I have a spare."
121,Perfect and arrived in a timely manner.
122,This device work great just what I needed it to do.
123,Merchandise was as advertised.  It is a good thing to have a spare charger & power cord.  I would purchase from the seller again.  Price was acceptable too.
124,"this charger is perfect for my nook hd plus, as everybody knows, the only chargers that work on the nooks are the nook charger. it works fine for me."
125,Perfect Nook-branded power block and cable at a good price.
126,Good price and its still working like its supposed to.
127,"I was very curious if it's really genuine or just pretending to be because it seems like almost every cable and charger sold in Amazon is labeled as being from the manufacturer.  Anyway, mine did not come in a B&N Nook box, it was in a tiny zip lock bag with a piece of ordinary paper obviously printed with a low-resolution inkjet printer that explains what Nook devices will work with it and what will not.

First thing I did was to put it side-by-side with the original charger that came with my Nook 8.9 HD+.  It was exactly the same size, shape, color and weight.  The only difference was the printed details in the charger.  The print was brighter and crisper in the original, but it was also decent in the new one I purchased.  Also, the QR code in the original was missing in the new one.  Finally, the hinge mechanism in the folding prongs was a little different, but the ""feel"" of folding and unfolding the prong was exactly the same.  With the USB cable, there was virtually no difference whatsoever.

So, I finally plugged it in and the tablet immediately recognized it and charged.  I honestly do not see any other difference.  If it came in an original Nook box, I would definitely proclaim it to be original.  Maybe it was from a company that bought them in bulk (it definitely looked brand new) and resold it, or maybe it was from the same China factory who manufactured them for B&N and decided to sell units outside their agreement.  Who knows?"
128,Works as expected.
129,"now i can charge my nook anywhere, no need for pc. a touch pricey at about $10, but i'm happy."
130,"I purchased this plug to see if it would work with the Mediabridge Brand USB to Micro USB card that I had purchased, because after getting the cable, my tablet wouldn't charge plugged into just any outlet.  I have a NOOK Color, and that plug worked to charge the tablet.  So I saw this one (at the largest Mass Merchandising store) for half the price here at Amazon and purchased it to try.  And it works.  Charges my Toshiba Excite perfectly through the micro USB port.  Now I can leave my original plug and cable at home and use this Nook Plug and Mediabridge Cable at work.  Perfect!  No more cords in my purse.
The Mediabridge cable I purchased:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mediabridge-High-Speed-USB-2-0-Coiled-A-Male-to-Micro-B-Cable/dp/B008DVMRXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mediabridge High Speed USB 2.0 - (Coiled) - A-Male to Micro-B Cable</a>
For under $20 I have an extra cable and plug to charge my Toshiba Excite."
131,Works fine but too expensive.
132,real garbage don't wast your money
133,No worries! Everything as expected!
134,Exactly what I wanted for a great price.
135,Works great.
136,"Brand name adapter this is just like the one you got when you bought your nook,. I would always recommend using a designated adapter. The charging cable is a whole different story but the adapter defiantly use the designated charger."
137,Good product
138,"I would like to say this product works just fine, but I'm not 100% sure. Purchased this to replace the 1st Gen Nook charger for an equally old (surprise) 1st Gen Nook. The Nook itself required a battery replacement as the original had somehow become swollen and useless. So I swapped out the battery and used this to charge the Nook, which seemed to work as the screen went blank after being stuck on the ""low charge"" display. Unfortunately, the Nook didn't seem to hold a charge anymore. Or something else went wrong.
In any case, this item worked as described. I think it's just the Nook is dead."
139,Bought this after trying a bargain priced sync cable.  I have had no issues with this cable or the wall adapter. It charges my Nook HD+ quickly and without having to jiggle the cable to get a connection.  Recommended.
140,This product was everything it stated.
141,My nook is working again!  Yay!
142,met expectations
143,"Purchased for my mother since she lost her original charger.  She wanted another OEM adapter, so I was glad to find one even if equally serviceable usb adapters can be had for cheaper.  Works fine, just overpriced."
144,I used this to replace the charger my Nook HD+ came with. The original adapter made this annoying high pitched sound when plugged into a power source. This new one makes no noise and works just fine so I'm happy with it.
145,"STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 2.5 MONTHS OF USE. And because of the return policy I cannot get a replacement unless I pay for it!

Ridiculous."
146,"Just what the Nook Simple Touch ordered, bewarned though this is what you get just the plug no USB cable so if you need that also it'll be another purchase, appears to charge fine only had to use it a few times so it's still like brand new."
147,perfect replacement that we needed
148,Love my Nook Charger... rapid charging
149,Very good
150,love it
151,Awesome
152,worked good until my sons cat got a hold of it
153,Works very well.  I do notice that when you do not plug it directly into your nook it makes a noise.
154,Works for me.
155,"Exactly the same as what came with my Nook. Works very well. Arrived quickly, packaged appropriately."
156,Just gave it 4 stars because it's proprietary. Can't find generic alternatives. Otherwise it works as expected.
157,I bought a cheaper model from eBay which did not work.  This unit works just great...
158,Life saver
159,My Nook charger was not doing so well and cant get at Barnes and Noble so ordered this.  Did the trick.  Thank you.
160,Love the charger and work great.
161,It appears that this is the OEM version and it works great. Just what I was looking for.
162,On TIME! GREAT PRODUCTS
163,works great
164,"I already had power converters and really only needed the cables, but at this price, why not just get both pieces and save the converters for backup? The set is OEM B&N, so I know I can count on it being correct. I have been burned before on non OEM cables, and  didn't want that to happen again.

This cable is for my Nook HD+, and both work just as expected. What is not to like?

Highly recommended."
165,just a great purchase
166,"This AC adapter worked out just fine and as it should!

Recommended.  Thank you."
167,Lost the charger that came whith my nook.  Barns and Noble wanted about $30.00 for this charger. This one worls like a charm.
168,Somehow this cord feels better built than the one that originally came with my nook. It is about the same length but if you pair it with a stand of some sort you can charge and watch a movie or read a book at the same time.
169,"bought for a spare for my 9"" Nook HD and it fit perfectly.  Very satisfied with the price much less than on the BN site"
170,Item works exactly as described with no problems so far. The charger is exactly the same as the original that'd you get from Barnes and Noble.
171,"Works as expected.  The original burn out, how I don't know.  But I needed a new one fast vey fast."
172,"Go to Target or Barnes and Noble instead, and pay $25 (which is still a huge markup, considering they make the thing for 50 cents.) This is the worst option if you need one of these. It's price gouging, pure and simple."
173,"This is a must have for the nook.  You can project anything on your display to the tv such as netflix, applications such as games.
No other tablet i know of does this at HD quality.  I use it like a DVR."
174,Works fine for the Nook!
175,I love the adaptor too bad I don't have the Nook anymore
176,For wife's NOOK to hook to TV for larger viewing
177,Works just like it says. Great for streaming movies while on vacation!
178,I got this so I could use the Xfinity app from my Nook HD+ running CM11 and it works ok it does not fill the screen 100% but it is still worth it.
179,"The product works but the connector just barely makes contact,  if you move the device at all it breaks the connection.  If you have your Nook in a case it won't work at all.
The only reason I gave it three stars was I was able to solve the problem by trimming the plastic edge down  with a razor blade,  this allowed the plug to engage more securely.  Perhaps I got a bad unit since others don't seem to have this problem.
Also,  you have to have it plugged into a power supply to work which was unable expected."
180,"This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7"" to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook."
181,It does exactly what is says.  Can't get any better than that!  Nice to be able to watch movies on the big screen as opposed to my little Nook screen!
182,"This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)"
183,"This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:

- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.
- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.
- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.
- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.

Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.

Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device."
184,"I am using this with a Nook HD+. It works as described. The HD picture on my Samsung 52"" TV is excellent."
185,Perfect!
186,"I have a Nook HD+.  As they are no longer produced I wanted to make sure I got an extra original charger and cable.  Glad I did as some OEM supplied cables, like this, just can't be replicated.  The quality of cable, especially Nook connector, are perfect."
187,Since we still have original Nooks we thought we still had a need for these chargers.  We found Nook chargers to be very delicate and not long lasting but they did charge the Nook quickly.  Now we use a regular charger and just let the Nooks charge over-night when we want to use them.  Only three stars since I would buy another one depending on the need and for quick charging.  Minus two stars for being too delicate.
188,My nook is working again! yay!
189,"I was skeptical of ordering these chargers as replacements, but the reviews were so positive I decided to give them a try.  They came days earlier than they were expected (an added treat) and immediately began charging the Nook.  I couldn't be happier.  As of this writing, if there were 10 stars to give, I would gladly give them."
190,"excellent, my nook is charging again.  :)  excellent seller"
191,The manufacture usb cable for my nook. It works great.
192,Doesn't get great contact.
193,Good original product. Great service. Will buy again from you anytime. thank you.
194,"This was exactly what it said it was, the genuine article.  Our old charger cord died, and we needed a new one right away.  We tried another less expensive one, but it broke almost immediately.  I'm sure this one will last for years to come."
195,Well pleased!
196,did not work
197,"Works, which is more than I can say for the $2 one I ordered first. :)"
198,As advertised.  Replaced lost Nook charger cord.
199,Just what I wanted.  No problems
200,Fast service and very happy
201,"Arrived in a timely manner, is an OEM replacement, works like a charm."
202,"this works great. got a generic one from somebody else, didn't work. had to send it back. ordered this one, no more problem"
203,II love it.....LOVE IT.....its completely perfect....its exactly what I wanted... a perfect fit into my very busy lifestyle... great product...
204,"I bought this for a Nook. And it fits my Kindle Fire. And the cheap NextBook I bought for the kids at Walmart for $69. Sturdy cover, protects well."
205,Perfect fit for Nook!
206,Easy fit for Nook. Looks good. Just like smaller version I got.
207,"Fits a Nook HD+ perfectly and gave this tablet a new look!
Much prefer this type of plastic clip-on four corners case, rather than the velcroed pocket type of case that this one replaced.
Came in the original retail packaging.
Only downside: a bit heavier than the PU pleather velcroed case."
208,LOVE IT!
209,It came on time which I love! I thought it would be set up like my other one but it's not and that's cool to! I really like the set up.
210,"A decent case, but still a little bulky."
211,great
212,"Perfect cover for the nook HD+. Fits well, does its job, stays out of the way. Two distinctively different angles to prop up the tablet, and both are very right for different uses of the tablet.
In fact, I realized that how good a tablet is liked depends so much on how easy it is use - propped up for reading, laid back for typing. And this cover/stand makes all the difference between using this old tablet easily, and using other, newer tablets without a well-designed stand."
213,Haven't used it since the Nook comes with a cover something I did not know but it looks well made and strong
214,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter, she loves it!"
215,This work great
216,"So this is a very simple, paper-bound album with a nice photo of a retro camera for the front cover. The covers are thick and strong, but the sheets and film to hold the photos are thin, so you wouldn't want to replace the photos often.
There is a thoughtful elastic strap to keep it closed, but I'm not sure how long that would last with everyday usage.
Ultimately, it's $10 so there's not really anything to complain!"
217,I made a photo album for a senior friend who was moving and I really liked the old camera picture style on this small album. great buy
218,Bought it as a gift. He loved it!
219,Ended up using this as a birthday gift for one of my granddaughters. Just the right size for putting in some old photos--her mother when her mother was growing up. Pics of the granddaughter when she was a baby. Added a few such photos and then invited her to come over and look through old photos to see if she wants any others.
220,I bought this to display some vintage photos that my father had taken while overseas during the Korean War. I dissplay it side by side with the camera he used. Love it. Great quality for the very reasonable price! Exactly what I expected.
221,Nice photo album
222,Love it but is sooooo little. I thought it was big
223,"Cute! Bought 2 for my daughter. I thought it was for instant camera photos because it was on the ""suggested items"" where I bought a instant camera case.  Oh well, she likes it so I'm ok with that.  They are nice."
224,"Bought this for my son and surprised him with some of his favorite pictures from his senior year in high school. He loved that it had a classic, sleek cover!"
225,Very cheap
226,very nice little book. Thank you
227,"Nice little photo album, wish it could hold more photos tho."
228,Cute
229,Great little photo book.  I love the vintage look.  Great for the price!
230,Definitely a cute little photo album. Small but cute
231,It is cute.. But I was expecting a little more from what the picture shows. Bummer.
232,Looks better on line than the actual camera photo album - Still nice!
233,I like this album. Sturdy front and back. Nice amount af sleeve for photos. Cute design in the front. Looks nice on my coffee table
234,"This is just a small little album but it is awesome. I love it. It looks like a camera lens. It looks old. It is easy to carry with you and holds just the right number of pictures to show off.
I would get another one. I think it is perfect for photographer who likes to show off their pics."
235,so cute - and great for the price.
236,"Georgous small photoalbum , looks exactly like pictured"
237,cute
238,Cute! Was what I expected. Will make a fun gift.
239,Small and cute.
240,"nice, cute album - would be a better value if priced a tad less expensive"
241,These are completely classic and high quality. I bought a couple of these to put in a welcome basket for out of town guests. They were a hit.
242,Super for your photos. Loved the vintage look.
243,This is just the right size for putting my photos in for gift giving.
244,"This is a very classic and unusual photo album, showing a camera that was used so long ago. It also keeps shut because of the loop and button. Doesn't hold a lot of pictures but just enough to carry some memories with you."
245,"I can't give it more than 3 stars because it feels like it is : Cheap.
Nobody mentioned the capacity but I could only store 30 6X4 pictures. I found ridiculous when people complain it is not leather, what can you expect for 8 bucks ?"
246,It is a nice small photo album. It was purchased as gift. It went over well. I liked ot over all look and the colors were spot on. The interior is a brown cardboard color. A niec small photo album.
247,small and ideal for small albums of photos.  We traveled to Cape Cod for four days and the photos we took were perfect for this small attractive album.
248,A great album.  Photos fit nicely into its protective sleeves and the camera cover looks cool.  I'm using several to sort out the photos that have been piling up over the last few years.
249,This is a decent little photo album. There isn't a lot to it; it's pretty standard. It is decently made and functions as intended.
250,My mother loved her gift of this album cover and some old photos.  It would be nice if it was leather but for the price this is great.
251,This is absolutely cool looking. Great to display your photos or excellent for gift giving.  It is everything out might want in an album.
252,"This book contains three novellas about vampires and Christmas.  Frankly, I wouldn't have guessed the two could be combined in any form worth reading but Betts has done it.  This is not a literary masterpiece but it is a fun, very sexy (yes, erotic)read.  If you are looking for something vampire light with a holiday feel then this one is for you.

In response to other reviewers: The cover guy is appropriate, he looks just like what I picture Ian to look like (not so much like Connor or Sean).

Also the names of the men in the Kindle edition that I read have been changed. Nick is Sean and Sergio is Ian."
253,What a shock I had when I started reading this.  None of the reviews mentioned that this was filled with erotica.
254,This book I gave to my mother before Christmas. She absolutely loves it and I am currently in search of more books by Heidi Betts.
255,"I was not very impressed with these books, though I have enjoyed previous Heidi Betts novels. It's possible I just don't like a novella length romance - I do not read them often. Also, these three books (especially the first two) were more erotica than romance, which I was not expecting.

I feel like the focus was too much on sex and not enough on the characters and forging a romance. The sex scenes were very long and drawn out, and the characters spent very little time interacting with each other outside of the sex. I am not prudish - I like my romance novels to have sexy time in them - but this just felt like those porno movies that try to have a plot but really shouldn't bother because people only watch them for the sex. There wasn't a lot of plot or character depth here.

Also, I found Betts' vampires to be extremely boring. It's like True Blood vampires Disneyfied. Her vampires are out in the open publicly and drink synthetic blood called ""NuBlood"" (hmmmmm). Other than that, they don't act like vampires at all. I like my vampires to have a little bit of bloodlust, a little edge... Eric Northman is sexy, these vampires were just BLAH. I would have preferred them to not even BE vampires and the stories would probably have been much better.

I wouldn't really recommend this book - her knitting romance trilogy was much better. This just fell flat for me."
256,"The final story at the end was just lacking. The woman works so hard making everyone else's dreams come true and then her story was just flat. I really like the picture on the front cover, though."
257,"As you might expect from the title (and the cover) this is a lighter collection...the tie that binds the three novellas together is a vampire named Angelina.  She meddles (in a good way) in the romantic lives of two other couples--the stories that make up the first two stories.  The first one is the lightest, the second one gets a little more serious as it involves the involuntary changing of a man with a terminal illness.  The third story is one for Angelina herself, and it is the most serious (in an obvious ""It's a Wonderful Life"" sort of way).

The background for the stories is that it is a given that vampires have been accepted as real, and overall are integrating into society.  There is very little blood lust/blood sucking going on (well, yes, from those Icky Criminals in the third story, but overall it's all very sanitary).

The author did a great job of setting the background in an unobtrusive way, and then just giving us the stories.  If the author was so inclined, she could easily expand into full length novels where we could learn the hows and whys of the world, but really she does a great job giving us just enough that she can stick to the shorter tales, and the shorter tales feel complete.  And naughty.  Did I mention naughty?  These are a little naughty.

Great little set of stories if these are what you are in the mood for.  Recommended!

JTG"
258,"This was a well developed story with characters that gave me clear feelings of sympathy, empathy, impatience and disdain. Mary Beth had a strong if rough beginning, when she finally remembered the grounding of faith she had been raised in, she tried to find her way back. When she finally got away from the environment she was living in, she was drawn back to the church and because of a prayer request from a lonely child she became involved in the life of her family.
This was n of what I expected, but definitely worth reading about. I have the rest of the series and will be reading it soon."
259,Good value
260,"I read this romance during a time I was researching various genres of books I could write it. This novel stuck with me because of its message of flawed characters who find love and redemption  at least a few do.

Mary Bridget Washburn must escape her prodigal and criminal past and seek a new life. So she retreats to the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. There she gets a position as a nanny for a widowed pastor with three young children. The oldest of those children is defiant and may be tempted by drugs. Mary perhaps can save her  at the cost of her own anonymity.

A loving relationship grows between Mary and the pastor. But if he knew about her sordid past -- ? And what can Mary do for the pastors oldest daughter to save her from self-destruction?

Struggles like this are real in many homes. This novel can bring insights and also the reassurance of Gods guidance and answers."
261,Good
262,excellent!
263,ok
264,Second chances are what God specializes in. This great story reminds me that no one can run too far from Him!
265,One of the best books I have read in a long time!  I couldn't put it down!  I look forward to reading the other books in this series.
266,"Although the plot was predictable from early on, this was an inspiring book.  The reminders of God's amazing Grace, as well as his protection and guidance were so good to read. It was an emotional read, as we get to know all of the characters, with a tense denouement and a peaceful resolution."
267,This is the first book I have read by this author! I really enjoyed the plot and had a good ending also!
268,This is truly the story of redemption that each one of us wants to believe in.  It is well written
269,"I have to say I could not get in to this book at the beginning.  It took until she started taking care of the children for me to really start enjoying the book and being unable to put it down until my eyes were drooping and I had too.  I loved the way she cared for A_______ when he was ill.  I loved her connection with the children and how she influenced and helped them, loving them and caring for their needs and more.  I loved the story being strong with God's redemptive power and the acceptance of His grace in their lives.  And I love good endings.  Loved this book once it started flowing for me!"
270,"When I looked at the cover art, I decided this book was going to be a sweet little romance about a sweet young woman. What I got was a fantastic read filled with suspense that at times had my heart in my throat. I just couldn't put this book down!

The characters were well thought out and some were just so real, they made me think of people I knew in my own life travels. The story line, especially the main character's situation, was quite realistic.

I truly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it. This is geared more to the adult audience, as it contains the horrors of meth production and addiction."
271,"You continue to live in the characters long after you finish the book.  There is such a variety of characters, there is someone in it you will identify with.

Story moves along very quickly but you can't wait to see what is going to happen next.  Good book for young adults who may be trying to make some decisions in their lives."
272,"""Not a Sparrow Falls"" is an easy, good read - realistic fiction about people you care about, facing real-life situations that test one's faith."
273,"I discovered Linda Nichols a few years ago when I read At the Scent of Water. It was at a time that I was desperately seeking books from Christian authors I'd never read before. The book impressed me, but I hadn't read anything else by Nichols, but this book made up for lost time. Nichols is a great storyteller.

I'm a bit critical about the ""Christian"" message in books, mainly because it's often heavy-handed. Most of the ""conversions"" are contrived and the characters have to twist into some awkward positions in order to see Jesus. In this book, however, the theme of redemption is woven in each scene. Each character discovers God's redemptive power in their own way. Also, Nichols has a way with finding a scripture and creating a moving story around it. She beautifully illustrates the promise of Matthew 10:29.

The pacing was great, also. I only found myself skimming twice, mainly at the end of chapters because I was eager to know what happened next. Some parts of the plot seemed predictable when I began the book, like Samantha's life as troubled teen and Jonah's situation. Nichols, however, takes these time-honored roles and made them interesting enough to keep me turning the pages.

Most of all, I think I enjoyed the book because it touches on the topic of ministerial burn-out. It is something that happens in church often but no one really seems to offer any solutions. The book, even thought it's a fictional account, shows a pretty realistic picture of how ministers get trapped in doing the Lord's work but not hearing from Him. I found myself going from rooting for Alistair to turn things around to being angry that he couldn't see how far he'd gone from what God intending.

More than once while reading this book, I had to force myself to stop reading in go to bed. Only a great book will make me do that."
274,"Mary Bridget Washburn is tired of living life as a druggie's woman. Her boyfriend spends all his time out in the back shop making ""candy"" and another man has been eyeing her. Mary knows its just a matter of time before this other man makes his move.
But neither man trusts Mary with money. Maybe they know if she has any she'll run away. They just give her enough to buy supplies to make meth and no more.

Finally Mary knows the time as come. She hunts around the rusting trailer until she finds the stash of cash from the drug deals, and then runs away, stealing their pick up truck. She abandons the truck in town, and takes a bus to Alexandria, Virginia, where she takes on her mother's identity and finds sanctuary in the shadow of a decades-old church.

But then a little girl needs Mary's help, and Mary hopes to help them. Can her past stay hidden long enough for her to give the hope she longs to give?

NOT A SPARROW FALLS was originally published back in 2002, and I'm fairly positive that I read it then, but if I did I didn't write a review. The book seems very familiar to me. Mary is a desperate woman, tired of living a life on the wrong side of the law, and yet knowing she is too far gone to return to her roots and the innocence she once knew.

The story is very well told, and not so dark as other stories I've read. There is an undercurrent of hope in this story, even in the darkness of the beginning, so you  know that somehow Mary will be able to dig herself out of the pit she's in. If you missed this story the first time, you won't want to skip it now. Pick up your copy of NOT A SPARROW FALLS for an uplifting story of hope."
275,"After spending several weeks barely reading at all based on a constricting financial budget and then the onset of a new job, I eased myself back into going through my book review stack with the volume Not a Sparrow Falls by Linda Nichols.

Not a Sparrow Falls could not have been a better choice.  It is the type of book that reminds a person why they started reading Christian fiction books to begin with.  Linda Nichols touched on a variety of topics highly relevant in today's society including meth addiction, child abuse, and depression.

Her story follows a young woman who flees her own personally bad situation and ends up in a small town where she shortly ends up employed as a nanny at a local parsonage where the pastor is not only the leader of a church but a high-profile Christian in many media outlets.  Everyone in this story needs help in some form or another, and even ""Christians"" are having trouble appreciating their faith anymore.  There is a lot to digest but the book is never without hope.

I think you will love ""Bridie"" from the get go as I did and will spend the whole book hoping for the best for her.

I received a review copy of this book from Bethany House to facilitate my review."
276,"The main character, Bridie, quickly becomes someone you know and can relate to.  She struggles to believe that the church teachings of her childhood still apply, even though her life has taken her far from the Christian values she grew up with.

At the same time, there's a family in another city that is falling apart... the mother has died, and the father is a pastor who feels disconnected from everyone and everything in his life.  It's easy to empathize with him, and yet see what others (his church leaders) are seeing from the outside, as well.

Overall, this was a great story and one that I enjoyed reading.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian fiction.

My copy of this book was provided by Bethany House in exchange for my honest review."
277,"Right now, I am standing and applauding Bethany House for finding such a jewel as Linda Nichols.

I believe Linda's grandmother and my grandmother were best friends, for she has captured the sights, sounds and smells of my girlhood between the pages of this book regarding the grandmother character.

The reader is caught up into the sphere of spiritual warfare from the very first page, and then reads how it all plays out in the earthly realm. I know I have read the first few pages of this before and I'm thinking it was a contest that Dave Long held on conversion experience. It was so gripping then that I remember it to this day.

This story is very unique and, yet, it is the oldest story since time began because we all get caught in Satan's web of seduction, we all think there is no way out, we all bargain with God at one time or another, we all get angry at circumstances and must fight to forgive our loved one's choices, and we all find out sooner or later that only God can cure all ills, heal all wounds and change all hearts... if we just allow Him the elbow room to do it.

This story is very well-woven. The characters are first rate developed and we see personalities clash in a most believable way. What I love most about this story is that every character grows, blossoms, and finds sure footing on their life path.

The main character, Bridie Collins, is worn out from the bad choices she has made. One day, she's had enough of buying ingredients for cooking meth and being the maid for two slothful drug dealers, so she bides her time until they both crash from too much of a bad thing. She steals the drug money and makes her getaway, calling a hot tip line to make sure that Jonah is arrested and put safely away so he won't come after her. The drug money is stolen so her plans for getting far, far away go awry. She settles in Virginia. Bridie is not her real name, it is her mother's. Somehow, taking on the name of her mother settles her spirit and infuses her soul with a modicum of peace. She is still running away from her bad choices and not facing the music, but we realize that she has some spiritual growing to do before that can happen. It may be the middle of winter, when snow swirling around, but what a garden grows in the little family that is blessed with her.

There are a couple of things that distract somewhat, and keep this story from being 5+ stars. When the paths of Bridie and Jonah part, we follow Bridie and then we're jerked from that story into the jail cell of Jonah. It does not lend to the storyline at all knowing what Jonah is thinking. The tension is better built with the fear from Bridie rather than Jonah's intentions. Also, there isn't a thing added to the storyline by knowing what Jonah's attorney is thinking or that she finally winds up out of the public defender's office and in the prosecutor's office. Those were major distractions.

In my opinion, it doesn't matter how excellently a story is written if we are led down dead end paths which do not include the protagonist. In crafting a believable story, the writer should understand that the reader feels cheated and bewildered when we don't know where we're going, there isn't any light at the end of the tunnel, and we're in the company of a character we do not know.

But don't let that keep you from buying this book for your Keeper Shelf. It is an extremely good character study of a pastor who is man-called, not God-called and of a woman who is coming to terms, with God's help, with her bad choices and how God works in our lives for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. Excellent read. Time well spent."
278,"Mary Bridget Washburn is tired of the direction that her life has taken. Caught up in a life of crime and drugs, she has abandoned her Christian roots, and is desperately seeking a way out. She runs away and tries to start a new life, but her past is only one step behind her. Meanwhile, the home of Rev. Alasdair MacPherson, a widower and father to Samantha and twin infants, is haunted by his wife's death...his life is in shambles and he knows no way to fix it. As this unlikely pair cross paths and discover the plans God has laid out for them, will Mary and Alasdair find peace in the Father, and healing through eachother?

Not a Sparrow Falls is a beautifully written novel that is enthralling and a joy to read. This is a story of redemption and trusting God beyond reason. Forgiveness is heavily themed in this book, both from the Lord and yourself...God is not bound by circumstances. It shows how two very different people can be used to bring meaning to life and straighten eachother's spiritual paths. Author Linda Nichols slowly reveals the past of the characters throughout the book, weaving it all together and making you feel their struggles in life and why they are where they are. This makes for a novel that is hard to put down! I closed this book with a happy and satisfied sigh, and am eager to devour more of Nichols work. Not a Sparrow Falls is about new life and a fresh start...the perfect spring read!

(I was given a copy of this book to review by Bethany House Publishers)"
279,"This is a story of God's love, of Providence, redemption, forgiveness, and God's preserving power.

The first eleven chapters move very slowly. They mostly contain background details and I found it very hard to connect with the characters during this time. I had nearly given up on the book when things really turned around. Chapter twelve begins a most wonderful story that will touch your heart. The characters that seem so dry at the beginning come alive later and draw you in. It ends up being a very richly written book.

The book focuses on two people hiding from their past - Alasdair, a Presbyterian minister and prominent radio pastor who was recently widowed and left with three children, and Bridie - a fugitive from both the law and her past. A chance encounter with Alasdair's teenage daughter leads Bridie to accept a position as nanny in Alasdair's house.

This haunting story stayed with me several days after I read it."
280,"I don't come across many novels where the subject is not heavily covered in today's Christian market, but the author does it with such strength and ability to craft a memorable story. Not only was this story captivating, it left me with memorable characters and a story line that will resound with me for time to come.
NOT A SPARROW FALLS is not a fast read. It requires a willingness to really delve into it, but once I entered the story world, I couldn't leave. The situations the heroine found herself in were heartbreaking and anxious. I loved the love story. It wasn't overt or edgy, but it was sweet and captivating. How I longed to see it resolved in the end. There were so many different threads that made up the tapestry of this story. From a family suffering from the loss of their mother, to a young woman running from a wealth of bad decisions, to a drug ravaged young man and the old woman who prays for them all.
I would give this book five stars, but I am giving it four because there was a theology issue, I do not agree with, namely once save always saved.
But aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It resounded and connected with me. I will not soon forget these characters or their story.
I want to thank Jim at Bethany House for my copy of this book to review."
281,A good story. This book is reasonably well written and the story is decent. What more can you ask? I liked it.
282,This book has an engaging storyline and a few really well built characters but it also has about a million sub characters. They muddle the story and make it confusing. Sometimes it felt like no one had edited this book because there were so many nonessential characters. The authors added a ton of detail to every mini character which just watered down the entire story. It was hard to tell which characters we important and which were just side liners.
283,What a fantastic read! Enjoyed everything about this book. Highly recommend it. So great to read something that is totally unpredictable. I'm sure I will reread someday and I rarely do that.
284,"First Sentence:  Neither of the two men trusted the other, but that, after all, was the nature of the business.

NYPD Detective Clay Ryder is the force's art expert.  When the Metropolitan Museum of Art receives a long-lost Van Gogh via UPS from Argentina, its Ryder's case to find out where it came from and to whom it belongs.  Israel's Mossad wants Ryder to help them find the SS officer they believe sold the painting from Paris during the war.  The rightful heir, Rachael Meredith, officially unveils the painting to the Met and finds herself besieged with people wanting the painting.  Things turn violent when Rachael refuses to part with the painting.

The action was good, the characters of Clay and Rachael were interesting and I always like learning something when I read.  In this case it was the looting of art by the Nazis.  But then, the story changed tacks and became more about Rachael, art dealers and auction houses.  While that was also interesting, it felt as though there were one too many story lines for me.  It was exciting and suspenseful, but could have used a bit more focus.  This was not a ""wow"" read, but it was a really good summer or airplane read. (EBMRG Selection)"
285,"this is a great idea. I know that virtually nothing computer-related comes with an instruction manual, and yes, you can just turn on your Macbook and it'll work, but there's so much you miss out on.

This is highly recommended for newbies to the Mac platform. I've owned a Macbook for years, and I always upgrade to a newer Macbook, but even I learned a few tips from this book I didn't know!

The average Mac user might want to take a look at this book at the library or from a friend; if you know anyone new to the Mac world, it'd be one of a few books they absolutely should get as a gift."
286,"This book is an exceptionally clear and informative *introduction* to all the major parts of the Mac OS.  Screen shots of every action are shown, and important parts of each window are clearly designated.

This book covers only the Mac OS itself, including topics such as various settings and preferences, attaching devices, networking, and backing up, and use of a few of the built-in programs (mail, contacts, address book, itunes, ichat, etc.)  It does not cover any of the well-known third-party applications such as Photoshop, MS Office, etc.  The information is crystal-clear, thanks to carefully done page layout, and there is lots of good explanation and guidance.  Occasional red-box warnings of important gotchas are not overused, thus effective.

The Mac system has become so elaborate and capable over the years so that I'm not on top of many parts of the system as I used to be.  Thus, for many aspects of the system, it was good to see this book's first steps for how to use a feature, or turn a capability on or off, that I haven't yet dealt with myself.  However, content does not go beyond the first steps, so an experienced Mac user may want a different, more thorough, Mac OS book.  This book is ideal for new-to-the-Mac users.

Two useful things:  First, purchase of the book also offers online access to it for 45 days.  Secondly, there are two tables of contents, one the brief overview of chapter heads, the next with the detailed list of topics.

The one problem I had with the book is that, despite the thoroughness of the index, some of the topics that PC migrants might look for are missing.  For example, the index has no entry for ""screen saver"" settings, which I guess are covered under ""sleep mode"" and energy saving settings.  Hardly a fatal flaw.

For its intended audience, this book is easily worth 5 stars.  But if you're not a Mac beginner, parts of the book would be useful to you, though you probably would prefer a more detailed advanced Mac OS book."
287,"This book provides a good overview of the features of the MacBook, the MadBook Pro and the MacBook Air and what can be done with Snow Leopard, the latest Mac operating system.  Frankly since Macs are so intuitive, such a book is probably not needed by anyone who has worked with any other Mac computers previously and is therefore only essential for those new to the Mac platform, i.e. former Windoze users.

What I found most  useful was the manner in which each featured action was accompanied by a numbered illustration.  Basically when trying to use a new feature you only have to be able to read the numbered sentence and then find the corresponding number on the adjacent illustration.

What I did not like is that many of the illustrations and their accompanying writing were so small that I needed to use my reading glasses in order to see them in full detail.  While this size issue was probably made necessary by the relatively small dimensions of the book itself, the publisher should have realized that many new MacBook users may be older persons.

As the parent of a teenager I know that younger Mac users, even first-time ones, cannot be bothered to take the time to read instructional books such as this one and thus I suspect that this book will be mainly used by the slightly older reader.  If I am correct, the publisher should have taken the size issue into account.  That it was not done is the only reason why I have dropped my rating of this otherwise serviceable book down to four stars."
288,"I was a bit surprised that someone went to the trouble to put a book together for the MacBook.  Macs are designed to provide an intuitive user interface.
I think I was right.  Most of the material is available for reference either on the Apple website or under the help menu.
However, if you wish to have some ink on cellulose reading material to make you more comfortable as you try to figure out how to use or optimize your use of the MacBook, this is the book to get."
289,"I have been using a PC for years and since Christmas I have constantly been asking my husband questions about using my new MacBook Pro, so this book was perfect for me.  It is presented in a very simple, easy to understand format, and doesn't assume one is a computer geek, which is great for me.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I looked up something which was not covered in the book which seemed like a very basic subject, which was frustrating, so I gave the review 4 stars.  If you are starting out with a Mac or are not very computer savvy, I would recommend this book.  It is one I keep close by to my Mac."
290,"Most of my family uses mac computers. My mom used to work in a UNIX/PC environment. She loves her mac, but often wishes she had a manual. Well now she does. This book is colorful and has a nice layout. My one small complaint with format is that I wished it was slightly bigger so that the font might be larger. Personally, I go to mac help or forums when I have difficulty, but if you, like my mom, prefer a book in hand, this just might be the perfect product for you."
291,"""My MacBook,"" is a good book for reference after your telephone support is gone and you need to read about ""how to's"" and have the computer in front of you. My husband has a very hard time reading from the Apple support page and then coming back to his machine to actually do what it said. With this book he can have the instructions right there.  This book is designed for basic Mac skills. I would have liked to se a few more intermediate skills in it.

This book or something like it should be included for any new users of MacBook users upon purchase."
292,"The title of this book and the editorial description are both lame.  This is not a book about using (just) your MacBook - but, rather, a Snow Leopard-specific introduction to using any Mac.  The only thing that is really MacBook specific - vs iMac or Mac Pro - is the brief illustration that shows what the various ports are.

This book is only for you if you have an Intel Mac running Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Note, too, that every Mac comes with iLife, yet this book does not make mention of any of the iLife applications.

While beautifully laid out and illustrated with screen captures, the editorial content of the book seems to have not been reviewed by a Mac expert, as there are numerous issues throughout that are either awkward, or not appropriate for a typical user.

In the first pages,  the author notes the use of context menus via clicking a right mouse button, but does not note that with certain Apple mice, the right button must be enabled in the System Preferences first.  He then talks about control-clicking (the way to get a secondary click with a single / left mouse button) on the trackpad - and does not mention the more convenient trackpad methods until much later in Chapter 8.

He notes that folders can be dragged to the dock, but does not point out that they can only be dragged to the right side of the dock only.  This is unfortunately typical of the almost-correct instructions throughout the book that a knowledgeable reviewer / editor might have helped smooth out.

On page 23, in a sidebar box called ""Remember your Gestures!"", Ray talks about four-finger swipe, etc., on the trackpad - but he does not introduce these until pages 213-214 in Chapter 8.  Even there, they are not adequately described.  Sort of hard to ""remember"" them on page 23 if you don't see it for another 200 pages.

Chapter 2 contains way too much information on extremely unusual network situations, breaking the flow of the whole book.  Most of the content of this chapter belongs in an Appendix in my opinion.  Much later, on page 150, Ray talks about sharing an internet connection in a way that most users would not understand ... or require.

Chapter 10 describes MobileMe backup before the more fundamental Time Machine backup.

The description of the keychain, which saves passwords, does not mention the importance of a secure login password to protect the (login) keychain.  Describing Address Book, Ray implies that a name can only be a member of one group, not describing dragging into multiple groups and opt-clicking on a name to see which groups it belongs to.  The description of displaying calendars in iCal is incorrect - suggesting that selecting a calendar displays its content, rather than checking the checkbox next to it.

The section on external monitors does not describe the designed-for-MacBook 24"" Apple display or how to operate with the laptop lid closed and with the external monitor as the only active monitor.

The Time Machine pages do not describe at all how to restore files - or how Time Machine can intelligently recognize certain applications, such as Mail, iCal or Address Book and restore individual mail messages, addresses, etc.

So, after not describing fully or correctly many of the basics of using Snow Leopard, Ray then goes into describing how to access the LaunchDaemon lists to delete services, something that most users should stay far away from.

The description of installing a new hard drive (to replace the existing one) is unrealistic unless the drive is dead - suggesting that one reinstall Snow Leopard from the original installation disks.  There is no mention of the more normal choices of (1) boot from the install disk and do a full restore from your Time Machine backup disk, or (2) attach the new disk via a USB or firewire cable and clone the old disk onto the new one before physical installation.

There is nothing in the book on how to burn data onto a CD or DVD via a Finder Burn Folder.  There is no mention of how to create a zip file (via the Compress command in the file context menu).

In summary, a lot of good content that is beautifully displayed, however there are also a lot of errors and omissions and inappropriate material."
293,"In my opinion this book is a  better value than ""Macbook Pro for Dummies"".  It's a great reference to have on hand."
294,It has a ton of information great resource but a of lot of stuff to read through before you find what you are looking for.  Over all worth the money!
295,"It is well written and has been helpful. I have discovered a few things that helped me to use more functions in my Mac Book Pro laptop.

R/ KMW"
296,My husband was so impressed with the cover that he would like for Marie to do his cover on his upcoming book and he is doing it through Kindle and Createspace.
297,"...VERY basic. Unless you have never used a computer, this book isn't going to help much.
I should rephrase this...if you never used a Macbook, this might help.
Good book, just more basic than what I wanted..."
298,"This book is beautifully laid out, visually clear and not too verbose.

However when I received this, I was running Leopard, not Snow Leopard.  This is not so much about using a MacBook on any platform, but rather using a MacBook running Snow Leopard.

Regardless of this, there were other limitations.  Overall this seemed to focus on accomplishing very basic tasks - common to all computers, Mac or PC - which Mac does so intuitively that I'm surprised this was the focus of the book.  I was looking for information on very specific Mac-things, such as Time Machine, how security works specifically on a Mac (i.e., no virus software), keyboard differences and shortcuts.  That sort of thing.  Mac has a lot of these, some of which are not immediately apparent to a former PC user, and I was frustrated by this lack.

This book would be best for someone with a new MacBook who is not that computer savvy on any platform.  For someone who is reasonably computer literate, this is much too simplistic, predominantly covering Snow Leopard topics that I feel most computer-literate people could readily figure out themselves...even if they've never had a Mac.

I'm donating it.  :-("
299,"I teach Mac OS and have been looking for a ""recommended reading"" book for my intermediate Mountain Lion class. This is it.

There is little in this book so specific to laptops that I would hesitate to recommend it to a desk-top only student. It is really about the OS, and it does a beautiful job introducing the power of OSX 10.8. Almost every page of the book contains numerous full-color illustrations that hold the reader's hand while marching them through operations on the Mac. I am experienced in printing costs, and I wonder that a book so laden with color can be offered to the market at such a reasonable price. It also happens to be very well laid out. Clean and simple. You can read it in a crowded, noisy restaurant and follow the argument easily.

The review before mine notes that some of the illustrations are so small as to be difficult to read. This is a fair criticism, but is more than outweighed by the virtues of this very ambitious visual training manual. Considering what the author attempted, this book is a brilliant success. Yes, there are warts, but they are few and not consequential.

If you need a compendious OSX 10.8 resource, I would recommend David Pogue's ""Missing Manual."" If you need to dip your head quickly and effectively into the features of Mountain Lion, I heartily recommend this book.

Be warned, though, that this is not a beginner's book. It assumes basic familiarity with computing in general. And the author has perhaps erred in putting network configuration toward the beginning of the book, which is a challenging subject even to veterans. Don't let this mis-step deter you, however. This book is a great guide to Mac's latest OS, which is well worth studying in depth. I can't recall a book that takes a student farther or faster into a new operating system."
300,An enjoyable read.  Clean type with good and easy to follow instuctions.  Written on high quality paper.  Only critcism is that some of the reference pictures are so small that you can not read them.  Isn't that what this instructual book is all about?
301,"This is the most useful book on Lion I have found after 7 months on a new macbook pro. I have read many of the other intermediate level lion books and found them wanting. Ray's Lion covers the useful stuff without losing you in detail, humorous side journeys, rush-to-press errors, or leaving out essentials. If I upgrade to Mountain Lion in 6 months, I will buy Ray's book on that.

Other os x books that have helped me switch back from Windows are: Iwork 09 portable genius for Pages and Numbers&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iWork-09-Portable-Genius/dp/0470475420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iWork '09 Portable Genius</a>; Iphoto 11 missing manual (but I am buying Jim Heid's iphoto 11 for review)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iPhoto-11-The-Macintosh-iLife-Guide-to-using-iPhoto-with-OS-X-Lion-and-iCloud/dp/0321819519/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iPhoto '11: The Macintosh iLife Guide to using iPhoto with OS X Lion and iCloud</a>; ipod missing manual which covers the touch.

I need books that accurately cover what most users NEED to know for effective use. Anything else is fluff or dangerous errors."
302,"This book is specific to Snow Leopard, which means it's obsolete for anyone currently buying a new Mac.  But if you're buying one used (or an archaeologist reading this millions of years in the future) you might find it useful.

Apple has a reputation for design and ease of use, but the nuts and bolts of a Mac are harder to grasp or learn about.  Since Macs don't come with an instruction manual (just a shiny little book that says ""hello"" on the cover) it's useful to have something like this around.

It's beautifully illustrated with screen captures, but strangely organized - things will appear in the sidebar that aren't explained until much later. It can be difficult to use as a quick reference, which, in my opinion, is really what an everyday user needs; this is meant to be read cover to cover, and by that point, you're a Mac genius."
303,"If you've never used a computer running Apple's OSX, then this book might be helpful. For most people who've used Apple products--even if just for a few months--this book will be a bit disappointing. It's not a bad book, but it covers some really basic stuff. If you feel confident playing with the dashboard and expose or if you know how to set up Mail, then you probably don't need this book.

Don't get me wrong--the information in this book is really helpful, and even some veterans will learn a trick or two. The thing is that all this information can be found online for free on a variety of Mac help-sites and message boards. So, if you're brand new to Apple and you want to get a head start, you might find this book helpful. But personally I'd just browse the web."
304,"I was hoping for more here than what you find in the officially sanctioned ""iWork '09 Portable Genius"" books that Apple puts out. Perhaps something less propriety would have have been nice. But all I saw in this book was more of the same. There are more pictures, which are of some help, but because ""My Mac Book"" sticks solely to the Snow Leopard operating system, you won't even get help with things like the Pages word processor. Since IPhoto is part of iLife, you don't get any help there either. Exactly what do you get help with anyway? Oh, iCal (which is largely intuitive), making files, working with Mail, using AirPort, and, get this, MobileMe--which is a paid, subscription service. Shilling for MobileMe should not be in a basics book like this, but there you are. It also goes into detail with Genius on iTunes. Genius is another of Apple's little features that is really nothing more than enticement to buy more music. So, here again the book is pandering again to Apple's sales dept.

Did I learn anything from this book? I wish I had. Most of it is so basic that I knew the ins and outs already. For the stuff that really had me stumped, such as a keychain disaster, it couldn't help me with at all. I found a fix somewhere else.

I suppose this book is better than nothing for rank beginners, but there are better ones out there. The official Apple books are definitely the better buy."
305,"My MacBook is good, general book and all things MacBook (and by default OS X). It is thorough in its coverage of every regular type of task or operation that anyone would need to do with their MacBook and it includes full color step by step instructions that will walk you through each task or operation and will help you get comfortable with OS X and your MacBook and become proficient in all the routine things that you will use your MacBook for. This includes managing your network and internet access, managing and customizing your desktop and menu bar, playing music and video, sharing files and accessing shared files over a network, sharing hardware such as printers and scanners, recording, editing, publishing video to various media including websites such as YouTube, setup and manage a MobileMe account, securing your data, troubleshooting problems with OS X, using Safari and Mac Mail, communicating with iChat, and much more.

I found this book to be clear and easy to use and would recommend it to anyone wanting to get the most out of their MacBook.

A Guide to my Book Rating System:

5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way.
4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.
3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.
2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.
1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper."
306,"First, this book was sent to me through a connection on LinkedIn in exchange for a review here.

My MacBook is a great book for anyone new to the Mac, or anyone who just likes having a great basic book for random questions that come up. I was very impressed with how detailed and easy to follow the directions are. Personally, I wouldn't have the patience to get into so much detail! On this point, kudos to the author. This covers everything from setting up a new MacBook to sharing files, folders, and printers, and just about anything you can think of in between.

It's very thorough. The author and editors spent a lot of time not only on detail, but also organizing the content in a way that makes sense to anyone picking it up. It's easy to read through, and it's easy to find a nugget for help here and there.

My only kvetch with the book is that this detail and thoroughness does come with a price: this is a dry read and there wasn't much effort to inject humor or entertainment. So if you like humor in your computer books check out David Pogue.

That said, this is still a good book for new Mac owners, and seasoned ones. I picked up a couple of tips I hadn't seen before and I've been using Macs for 5 years.

You won't be disappointed with the content and will become comfortable and productive on your Mac."
307,"If you are a Mac OSX MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook AIR newbie or have used these laptops for some time without really ""digging into"" the system then this is a good book for you. The author does a good job of very clearly outlining the essential operating elements of your Mac laptop in an easy to understand style that may bore the more advanced users but is spot on for us beginning and intermediate users who will find the book to be a useful reference. He does a very nice job of walking us through the screens necessary to connect to wireless networks and even has a section on how to use your iPhone to tether WiFi to your laptop. He does a good job of taking us through the basic programs included with OSX including Mail, Safari, Address Book, iCal and the rest of the lot including the ins and out of iTunes and MobileMe. The book goes into linking the Mac laptop with external devices as well as providing some solid advice on how to keep your data ""safer"" through activating the firewall and how to use Time Machine. The troubleshooting section is OK but he doesn't go into much detail on how to utilize some of the software tools available for diagnosis but does provide a listing of helpful tools and where to obtain them. In summary, this book is really ""The Missing Manual"" (as many Que Publishing books were called previously) and should be an essential purchase with any new Mac laptop in order to obtain the most out of your system."
308,I would describe myself as a very basic Macbook user.  It is primarily used for word processing and surfing the web.  This book provided valuable information and it was intuitive to use and find the topics you need help with.  I keep my copy right by by computer.
309,"Apple deserves its reputation for elegant design and intuitive interfaces, but that does not change the fact that computers are initially somewhat difficult to understand - obviously for the first-time user, but perhaps even more so for the desktop PC user making the paradigm shift to Mac, mobility, or both. This book is the perfect curative for this condition.

From a concise overview of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mac-OS-X-10-6-Snow-Leopard/dp/B001AMHWP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard</a>&nbsp;desktop, through initial configuration of network connections and email clients, and then into Apple's bundled applications,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-MacBook/dp/0789743035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My MacBook</a>&nbsp;was cleverly designed to rapidly raise the novice to a level of comfort and proficiency. Each page is laden with full-color images and short step-by-step instructions, teaching the reader exactly what he or she needs to know without unnecessary verbiage or technical detail. While clearly intended to be read start to finish, the book is very well indexed and organized, allowing the user to quickly find the solution to a particular problem if and when the need arises.

Bottom line: if you're not already an Apple genius, and you have a MacBook, check this one out. More computer books should be written like this."
310,"I already know probably more than most about OS X, but this book does a phenomenal job of writing about many different topics in an uncluttered, and aesthetically pleasing way.  It's a very Apple-like publication with very high use value to all but the most die-hard Mac users.  It makes a great present to somebody who switched to Macs, too."
311,"This is a useful book for those new to Apple laptops but it also has handy hints for those who have used Macs for a long time but never took the time to learn many of the features. That brings up one of the strong points about Macs -- they are so easy to use that you don't need to spend much time educating yourself on how to use them. Consequently it is easy to be unfamiliar with useful shortcuts and tools and even some of the fun features.

I found the layout and colors to be pleasant and practical. The size of the book seems about right, covers are nice, and paper quality seems very good. The illustrations are clear and attractive although some of the screen shots are too small.

Overall, I found ""My Macbook"" to be superior to many computer handbooks in readability, content and appearance. Of course, it won't tell you everything you might possible need to know but it gives a comprehensive foundation and you can also find answers to more advanced questions on the Web."
312,"I've used Windows for years and wanted this book so I could use my son's Macbook Pro on occasion - when he lets me.  I've been intrigued with Macs since my kids first got on them in their elementary schools.  I've always found them more user friendly and certainly sturdier for kid use than PCs. The only thing that stops me from taking the plunge and buying one is that the software I use for work is only for PCs.  (Since reading this book, I've discovered there are ways around that issue.)

I admit I still have trouble with Mac's interface at times, and the trackpad just about all the time, but this book has helped me through my discomfort. (My two finger slide to scroll is evidently just not effective for some reason.) The layout of this book makes it easy to find what you're looking for without having to read page after page of a part or process' origins in the computer industry. I hate that about most computer books.

My conclusion:  Macs are different. And 'different' doesn't have to mean frustrating. Read the book and take the plunge."
313,"Title: My MacBook
Aurthor: John Ray
Publisher: Que Publishing
Copyright: 2010
ISBN-13: 978-0-7897-4303-9

Although the title of this book is My MacBook, this book covers all of Apple's laptops - MacBook, the MacBook Pros and the MacBook Air in depth.
John Ray provides a solid, uncomplicated tour of these machines and has arranged the information so that it's easy to understand. Of course, a how-to book is not necessarily designed to read from cover to cover and this one is well indexed and organized so that answers to questions can be found easily.
In addition to set-up and basic instructions, the book takes on some daunting subjects such as networking, sharing and wireless connectivity in a calm, non-intimidating way. In addition, a complete explanation of MobileMe and Airport Extreme are both very helpful.
All experience levels will get a lot of good information from the 325 page book. Highly recommended."
314,"If you are new to the Mac operating system or just not as familiar with it as you would like, this book is worth checking out.  The format of this book is non-threatening and friendly; if you can call a book that, in the way that it is not a big, boring book of foreign data.  The pages are designed with lots of color to keep your eyes interested.  So if you or someone you care about needs to unlock the power of the Macbook, the information is in here.

There are color screen shots of everything described in the book.  Sometimes when learning about the terminology, you will finally know what the initials stand for, like PPOE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet).  But it will not always set it up in a definition-like format, so you might have to pay close attention.  But that is probably just an exception.  There is no glossary of terminology, but there is a detailed index which should work the same for you.

Additionally, you will be able to learn a lot about your Macbook if you can get to the Apple Store and take one of their free intro to Mac classes offered at all stores.  I have taken it, and learned lots!"
315,"When I saw this book, I was not quite sure what to expect.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find it handily beat my expectations.

* The book is a good size.  It's not some 2"" brick and it's not too small.  Just right to throw in your backpack or briefcase.
* The format and illustrations are PHENOMENAL!  The book has a very cool, very easy format that just flows.  The color diagrams are a huge bonus.
* Book content is well rounded.  It covers all the basics as well as some of the more 'advanced' features.  This makes it very useful for the first time Mac buyer, Windows convert, or casual user.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who is jumping into the Mac world or other who just aren't that comfortable yet with the MacBook."
316,"My main intent in getting this particular book was for my wife, who has a MacBook (we both have iMacs - for which much information is still applicable). Keep in mind that this book is written with Snow Leopard as the intended OS, but there is not much difference from Leopard, if that is what you have.

Her impressions:

*Has easy step-by-step instructions with numbered illustrations

*Helpful hints/tips/shortcuts

*Easy to read for the lay person (not heavy with tech jargon)

*Covers wide variety of topics

*High quality, portable reference

My impression is that one cannot go wrong with purchasing this as a guide to the Mac/MacBook, especially if one is highly accustomed to Windows or a much earlier version of Mac OS, though all Macs come with helpful guides within the system that can be found in Spotlight or Help. The Apple website has many sources of helpful information, also, such as tutorials."
317,"I have had my Macbook Pro for almost two years now and I must admit there is not a whole lot in this book that I did not already know. For the newbie, however this book is exceptional! I wish this book had been out when I had first gotten my Mac. I feel that Snow Leopard (MAC OS) is intuitive enough, but sometimes just a little bit more information is needed and that is where this book might come in handy. It really covers just about everything in Snow Leopard from system settings and personalizing your Mac, using just about every application including Itunes, and basic troubleshooting.

The book is in full color, with labels on the pictures for the step by step instructions for each item it walks you through. It is very intuitive and easy to understand.
I would say that this book would be helpful to both someone who used to use a Windows based system and transitioned to the Mac as well as someone new to computers and bought a new Mac. People already familiar with the Mac won't get too much out of this book though.

I can't recommend this book enough to people who are new to either a Macbook, Macbook Pro or MacBook Air! Buy This Book!

Now, if only the author, John Ray, came out with a more advanced book for me!"
318,"I've been using this book to help my mom transition from PC to Mac. She's kind of technophobic--which is the reason for the switch--and she's also the type of person who feels better if there's a manual to refer to. So far so good.

The book goes beyond teaching you how to use the computer itself, it also includes things like how to use email, the internet and various applications. Even if you need to learn how to upload movies to YouTube, use Bluetooth or set up a wireless network, it's all here.

I highly recommend it to both Windows-switchers and Mac users; it can be used as either a training guide or a reference book."
319,"My MacBook is a good step-by-step manual on the default MacBook hardware/software.  Each lesson is well organized, easily explained, and features pictures for those who just want to breeze through and learn a new tip.  While most of this information can be found online or by using the Mac's ""Help"" feature, It was nice just to sit in bed and learn more about my computer without having to be actually on the computer.

This book is definitely not for seasoned Mac users, but is a great guide for those who are thinking of switching to Mac and want to learn more about the interface."
320,"The book tells every mac user how to best make use of their macbook.  While I already knew much of the info contained, but self-discovery and self-teaching, there were quite a few things contained within the book that I found most helpful.  The book pretty much contains every and anything one needs to know about how best to use their macbooks and make it work for you whether that be for personal and/or business use.

Especially great for those that do not live or have access to a Apple store and or genuis in person."
321,"I purchased an Acer Chromebook and found I needed some assistance. This book covers the basics and is great for a beginner in the Google Chrome OS. It isn't as detailed as I would have liked and had to call on my experience on Ubuntu Linux to fill in the omissions and use some trial and error to get the system to do what I wanted. It is the only manual I found at this time and if you want to get into Chrome OS, it will be a great help but not the perfect instruction manual like Teach Yourself Visually."
322,"I tried to use this book to get caught up on Chrome OS while I waited for my Chromebook. Unfortunately, the information and illustrations are way out of date."
323,"I love my chrome, but it is very different from windows
this book helps you fill in the gaps, I have used chrome a few times before I bought my
notebook, still I find I need to look up how to do certain things. I suggest it
if your buying a chrome notebook.  You don't have to, but it saves a lot
of stumbling time."
324,"Fast, Simple to use and overall a very inexpensive laptop.

If your using your laptop to just surf the web and check your email then this little guy is perfect.
And don't forget all the free apps that Google has in the store.
Also you get a lot of free cloud storage from Google as well.

So simple my mother can use it!"
325,"I'm glad that I bought this little book as a reference & a learning tool, as I'm finding that I didn't know as much as I thought!!"
326,"I like this book. I appreciate the easy to read charts. The use of color. The chapter divisions & clear explanations.
I would not have wanted to open my Google Chromebook without it. If you get a chromebook... this book is a must read/musthave < for ready reference."
327,"This is a very nicely laid out, colorful, and beginner-friendly book about the Google Chromebook. 5 stars for that!

The only problem (minus 1 star) is that things have moved on since the book was published. So where the book states that the Chrome OS has no PC-like ""desktop"", it does now. And where the book describes the ""four"" Chromebook models (correct at the time of publishing), there are now some newer models such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Chromebook-Wi-Fi-11-6-Inch/dp/B009LL9VDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Series-3-Chromebox/dp/B007Y8DJEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Series 3 Chromebox</a>. And where the book suggests that the Chrome file manager doesn't allow you to copy files from one location to another... well, now it does. You get the idea.

This book may still be incredibly useful and very appealing to beginners who want a nice pictorial introduction to the Chromebook concepts and device; and if the author published an updated second edition then it would likely be the best book on the subject. In the meantime, you will find more of the recent Chromebook and Chrome developments (like Google Drive) explained in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chrome-Book-Second-Edition/dp/1481009184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chrome Book (Second Edition)</a>."
328,Clearly written book explains Chromebook procedures in easy to follow chapters.  I bought this Chromebook for my sister-she is challenged by new technoilogy!  She had it working the first day!  I was so impressed-bought another for myself!
329,"I received the initial version of this book which was out of date. This book is updated to the current and has many good factual pieces of information. I would not recommend that he change the cover of the book from Ver 1 to an updated version as it can be confusing. I would recommend purchasing this book but for the author, I would suggest you delve into some of the apps more in depth and subjects as the Labs-what they are and why they can be so helpful."
330,"I am a huge fan of the Chromebook. This book is good, if you want to know more about the Chromebook this little book is packed full of information."
331,"If you are looking into purchasing a Chromebook you will find it worth your while to read this ($15) book first. It is a well balanced review of the Chromebook's strengths and weaknesses and will either save you a few hundred dollars or convince you of the wisdom of the purchase. There is also a GREAT review under the ""Samsung Chromebook"" product by Lance Haun that will help you (as it has over 2,000 other folks). Good reading and NOT too technical."
332,A great book for getting the most of a Chromebook. Well written & thought out by the author. Would recommend to a friend.
333,"If You are either Dr ""Tony"" Newman or Dr. ""Doug"" Phillips, and the Time Tunnel got stucked in the middle Ages, DON'T BUY IT. A contraire, if You are a present time business person, go get this book. Even if you don't own a Chromebook. You will have a very pleasent ride into the implementation of the Cloud concept, SW and HW wise.
Bravo Zulu !! Great Book."
334,"I bought this book before making the decision to buy a Chromebook.
It was worth the price and the time invested in reading.
The Samsung Series 5 550 Chromebook I then bought proved to be and excellent computer."
335,"The Chromebook I bought was sold without a guide that gets you past very basic interaction with the device.  This book answers most of my 'How do I do that?' questions as I explore the work in progress that the Chromebook is.  While it will soon be obsolete as Google's work progresses, it serves the purpose to help get a lot out of today's (2012) Chromebook."
336,"I wanted to know more about the Chromebook, but couldn't find much information written about it. This book contains everything I wanted to know about what a Chromebook is, and clearly explains what it can and can't do. It points out the similarities and differences between Chrome and other operating systems, discusses using the Cloud, identifies why some things won't work and explains ways to get around the limitations. I found the book informative and very helpful."
337,"I am using this mount for a 27"" LCD in my bedroom. Using a swivel mount with tilt works great for almost any room layout. The black powder-coat paint matches the TV, and looks great. Adjustment and locking is easy with the included hex wrench. I would rate this ""5 stars"" if the mounting screws were better. Made from relatively soft steel, the screw head strips very easily. After ruining one screw, I replaced it with a large black deck screw. It might be advisable to drill small pilot holes before attempting to drive the screws.

Word of caution: If you do not drive the proper mounting screws into the center of a wall stud, if you exceed the specified TV weight limit, or if you try to get by with a really cheap swing arm mount, you may be signing a death sentence for your $500 TV (and perhaps yourself)!"
338,"For the money you can't go wrong. Yes, it has a litlle play in the mechanism but, you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that. It works great and frees up counter space. I would do it all again. Why spend 3 times more."
339,"I needed a television hanger with good extension. This did the job. I installed this in a closable TV cabinet that requires me to push the TV in and pull it out routinely. By loosing the nuts on the swinging parts a little, it now moves with very little effort. But the nuts are the kind that will hold their position, even when they are loosened so no worries of things coming apart. I have a 43 inch TV that it worked just fine on. Glad I bought this."
340,"Good quality for the price. Actually does go 24 inches from the base to the vesa mount. Not quite enough to turn a thin bezel 55"" tv 90 degrees but 70 degrees is good enough for me."
341,Very nice and sturdy.
342,"This works perfectly with my 65"" Vizio."
343,bolt snapped off in my wall because the components of this device are extremely cheap.
344,"I have had this mount for about 4 years now and it has held up well. I love the fact that I can easily view my TV from almost any angle in my room. Whether I'm laying in bed, or at my computer desk this mount allows me to adjust the viewing angle to where I can see it perfectly. For the most part, I keep the mount completely retracted and it looks great. It is almost flush with only about an inch or two gap from the wall. I would highly recommend this mount to anyone looking for a versatile TV mount!"
345,DID NOT fit as described  to accommodate the TV size!
346,This was easier that I thought to installed...even easier if you us a STUD finder to locate the beam where the you will need drill and attach the mount to the wall.  It came with many sets of screws to fit most TV systems.
347,Good product....Great seller....Thank you!!!!
348,"This mount is sturdy (I have a 32 inch LCD TV, it only weighs 11 lbs, but I'm pretty sure the mount weighs more...).  Installation was easy, all the parts and hardware that we needed (and didn't need!) were in the box.  We had it up in very little time.  It's great.  One person could hang it alone, but two makes it much easier.  It has multiple points that you can level the television, so it doesn't necessarily need to be perfectly level (the installation person for me got it right).  There is no list, and it holds position really well."
349,"Very solid
Lots of mounting options
This unit allowed me to attach to the flat screen and then push the who;e unit back to within 1 inch of th wall
Perfect"
350,"Only issue so far is the hinges are firm, but that is probably by design (so the tv doesn't swing from where you want it). Overall a fantastic product - that 2' extension really gets it far from the wall and much closer to my desk (using a 40"" 4K tv as a computer monitor)."
351,It met expectations
352,"I bought this mount for a 42 Vizio TV I inherited from my in-law to mount in my home office for computer and TV type use. I had a tight space between a desk and window to mount the TV so I wanted something that could move and this fit the bill. I was a little worried about the one stud mounting design but I made sure to find my stud properly in the wall with a stud finder and use a small nail to poke the wall to find the true edges of the board. Once I did that it was some measure to find where it would sit on the wall as far as TV height. Measure twice and drill once. I drilled the holes for the bracket on the wall starting with the top hole and using a level when marking the bottom hole. I put the lag bolt in the top hole first part way and then again used the level when putting the bottom bolt. Before tightening it down all the way I used the level one last time to get it level to my comfort level. Was done the bracket felt solid on the wall. I then mounted the bracket on the TV with fit perfect on the VESA mounts without using the extension arms that came in the kit. The kit was missing one bolt of the M8-15 bolts but luckily the M8-30 bolts fit into the bottom holes of my TV without being too long so I didn't have to contact Amazon about the missing bolt but was a little disappointed about that. Some quick screw driver work on the mount was on with the washers provided. I adjusted the tilt of the mount to face the TV down for my situation and realized I got it backwards once we lifted the TV but that was just an honest eyeball mistake. Some quick turns with the provided allen wrench to adjust the tilt and back on the wall it went. I tighten the one mounting bolt that holds it on and we are good to go. I adjusted the arm to where I wanted the TV and it felt was very solid. The articulating arms were a little stiff without the TV on their but once I put the 35lb TV on it moved fine, done want a loose swing mount. I didn't experience any sagging or off level issues. It is a two person job for heavy TVs to mount them but I did all the mount work on the wall and TV alone and only needed help with lifting the TV on to the wall when ready. Comes with an assortment of mounting bolts for the different TV holes, wrench, and allen wrench. You will need a drill and some drill bits for pilot holes. Good buy and would buy again."
353,Heavy duty..adjustment any direction..Great mount to. Worth it $$
354,Very good
355,"Holds up my older and very heavy 42"" plasma TV at a 90 degree angle without an issue.  Its a quality product. Very well made!"
356,have not purchased this item
357,just as advertised
358,Excellent Product...
359,"I wanted a really long extendable wall mount for my 47 inch flat screen LED tv so that I could view it from my bed and this mount got the job done.

This is one of the longest extendable wall mounts I was able to find anywhere. I can extend this 180 degrees for a full viewing experience of my TV from my bed which is positioned parrall to the mount.

A sturdy, quality mount at a fair price!"
360,Perfect fit
361,works great.
362,"I originally bought this for a Sony 40"" TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42"" instead. I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs. I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it. (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.

Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine. Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims. I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install. Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem. The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force. Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.

I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises. An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount. If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it). If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount."
363,Sturdy and light holder.  Amazingly flexible.  Easy to install and hang  It comes with instruction sheets and every bolt needed.  I mounted it into a wood stud.  Highly recommended.  I bought a second one for an older LCD.  Be certain not to overload it.  The one drawback is that the TV plate might block some of the HDMI or other sockets.
364,Used for a 42 in led set. All hardware needed to fit pretty much any model.
365,"I initially bought a Mounting Dream mount, which was very solid and easy to install, but only had a 15"" extension. I needed a 24"" extension for a very tight corner, so I bought this one, but it doesn't seem quite as solid as the Mounting Dream mounts. Still, it gets the job done."
366,A+++
367,Excellent mount with tons of different mounting options.  I used this to mount a fairly old (13 years) LCD TV in our home gym and was very concerned that the mounting brackets would not match up...I was wrong.  Because of the included extra parts and various configurations I was able to seamlessly wall mount our TV and position it perfectly in our gym.  GREAT product with simple straight forward instructions.
368,"One of the bolts seems to come loose with side-to-side rotation. I'm keeping an eye on it now, but it was pretty significantly unscrewed when I first noticed, which was scary. It might be worth the money to buy one that is certified."
369,Worked great
370,It attached to our tv without the extention arms.  It only took minutes to install. The hinges are really stiff so we will move the tv while holding the wall mount not the tv. We worry it will pull to much on the TV and possibly crack it.  Hopefully with use it will move easier.  It is very easy to attach to the TV and the wall.
371,"Works as described, even fully extended."
372,These are fantastic.  I purchased one because I had a new flatscreen and paid someone 60$ to install it.  After watching how fast he did it I purchased two more and hung the other two myself!  Please note I have ZERO skills.  This takes less than thirty minutes to hang and really moves smoothly.
373,This works well and was easy to install. The only thing I don't like is that it tilts forward a little bit and I can't figure out how to stop it.
374,"My bedroom is set up so that my bed faces a window. I needed to mount my TV on the side wall and have it swing over so I can watch TV when I fall asleep. I was a little nervous about having my TV dangling off of one of these mounts. I've had it mounted (into a stud, of course) for about 2 years now with no problems. I'm still always nervous about it because the TV seems so heavy. Hopefully I did a good enough job installing the mount! I'll let you know if it ever stops working (aka falls!)."
375,"Great for its long arm. I was able to turn my 50"" Vizio TV totally to the right (90 degrees). The edge of the TV was just barely touching the wall. Sturdy enough if you get the bolts in the center of a good stud or better yet into a 4x4 column."
376,Works fine.
377,The mount is as expected.  It was easy to install and performs well.
378,"Any product by this company is a hit and well worth the purchase over the high prices for like items in shops like Target or BestBuy.  I have bought 9-10 VideoSecu products over the years and all are extremely well built, easy to install and easy to use.  I will only uy their products from now on for my TV and computer screen mounting needs."
379,"Was as specified and went up in less than 30 minutes. Very well constructed. Will hold a lot of TV weight!!! Great range and versatility.
Would highly recommend!"
380,nice
381,"has been in used for two years so far, still nice"
382,My TV is still on the wall.
383,"The mount is very sturdy and installation was a breeze.  However, I do have a few gripes:

Stiff: re-positioning the TV can be difficult because the joints are so tight, that moving the TV around on the mount isn't very easy (this may be due to the rigidness).

Tilt: the up and down tilt function is limited to 10-15, so don't install it too high up.

Cable management:  The mount comes with cheap plastic clips that you can guide your wires through.  However, they're loose and don't seem to help too much.  Not a big deal."
384,good
385,Very satisfied  I would recommend it.
386,"Great sturdy stand but the HDMI was missing so I returned it, its giving me second thoughts about ordering another"
387,Standard wall mount. As expected and worked well for my application. No complaints.
388,Not as sturdy as I expected. I font recommend putting anything bigger than a 32 inch tv on this mount.
389,"Works, but the way it's designed, it's hard to get the tv perfectly level. Bugged me too bad so we replaced with much smaller tv and it works fine"
390,worked great
391,easy to setup allow the viewing of TV from different directions
392,"I was very happy with this mount for my situation. I mounted a 50"" Vizio to it that is about 35 lbs. No issues at all with the weight and it moves easily just as I needed."
393,"Best value in wall mount and is of excellent quality. Have purchased many of these now, andd will only purchase these in furture."
394,Its been on my wall for 5 years.  Nuff said
395,Works fine
396,"Does the job we ordered it to do. I followed the instructions for 400x400 and have ""bunny ears,"" as we've been calling them, sticking up past the top of the TV. The holes on the back of our television are not centered though, so I don't think it's the mount, or anything we did wrong. If the four holes were centered on the back it would be fine. We have an LG5600, 42inches. Full motion mount. TV tilts up and down, side to side, along with arm that moves side to side. Great for corner mounting. Easy installation using stud finder, drill, and level. Will be buying another for a different TV. Also have another mount by Videosecu bought 6yrs ago that's held up well. Haven't given it any thought since we put it up in our living room with a 47in Samsung."
397,Returned it.  It doesnt allow you to adjust it in order to center the tv in the space you want.
398,"I've bought two of these mounts for mounting a 47"" TV. They installed easily and with little hassle. You will need a drill for making the pilot holes, but otherwise it's a very simple install. 2 years later and they still work great."
399,Easy to install. Works perfect for my 45 inch. Very sturdy. Love having the option to move the direction of my tv in my room. Wish I got this for my living room as well instead of the flat steady mount.
400,"I'm not sure how I did it, but miraculously I was able to attach this assembly to the back of my 55"" LG.  Fortunately, this thing was meant to adapt to nearly unlimited orientations and configurations, so after a lot of finagling, I was able to position the arms so that they did not interfere with my power plugs or HDMI cable.

I'm hedging my rating since the product's directions did not mention that it would not work with my TV, and due to the effort required to get it to do so."
401,"Good product. Used on a 24"" TV. Had a little issue with the length of the screws that came with, but I had other washers to use so it worked out ok. Seems nice and sturdy once I got it mounted on the wall."
402,holds a 32 inch vizeo well and the adjustment is great
403,"Subtract (1) Star for Instructions:

Be prepared to figure out everything yourself. The instructions contain obvious information like drill a pilot hole. But as for actually getting this thing set up, you are on your own.

Subtract (1) Star for Incomplete Garbage/Parts:

I purchased 2 of these to mount a monitor and tv (Both used as computer displays). If your tv or screen has the basic 100mm (4 holes) on the back, you will need to buy a handful of tiny washers from your local hardware store (I had to use 5 washers per screw  2 monitors, 8 holes, 40 washers). The screws that come with this are a half inch too long  you will not be able to secure your screen to the mount! While this is only another $6, it was a major inconvenience when setting this up late at night  I barely got to the store in time.

Also, some of the tools that come with this are just garbage. The little wrench they sent to adjust a few of the bolts bent upon first use. You are going to want to have your own tool set when setting this up. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SOCKET WRENCH! I cannot stress that enough!

Side note: This is going to be much easier with 2 people. I was able to set it up on my own, but if you have the option have a buddy help.

Pros:
- Once set up, these look great.
- The quality seems pretty top notch (although Ive only had these up for about a day)
- Everything is adjustable: You can set this up so that its very tight and doesnt move, or you can adjust it so that its fairly loose and swivels pretty easy (which is what I did)"
404,"Great mount used it on my ""32 TV and not I can swing it in between two rooms"
405,"would order from again, A++++"
406,Perfect
407,"This wall mount successfully held my 32-inch LCD TV for over 3 years in my home, with no issues whatsoever. For a price far cheaper than what I could find in the store at the time, I couldn't recommend this product enough! I haven't tried anything heavier than my 32-inch, which weighed about 20 pounds, but it was perfectly sturdy at that weight. The joints all moved freely without being too loose, and I never had an issue positioning the TV just how I wanted it. A great buy!"
408,"very nice, good quality, easy to install, good price"
409,Excellent
410,Exactly as advertised!
411,Works great! I was working with a 32'' TV that I wanted to mount above my fridge. It moves around perfect and lets me do exactly what I wanted. It was hard finding a mount that would let me work in the small area. The arm has a great range of movement allowing me to get the perfect angle and distance for a good kitchen TV.
412,good product
413,Awesome! very easy to install or put together!
414,Great product
415,"Good Waal Mount TV, shipping time and excellent package."
416,"this is a fantastic wall mount.  Very sturdy and very well constructed.  I'm using it to mount a 55"" led tv and it shows no signs of stress from the weight.  Works very easily and I can swing the TV out and in any direction with no effort at all.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality at such a reasonable price.  Get it,  you won't regret it."
417,"Ordered 2 for my Samsung and Insignia TVs, they worked perfectly and were easily installed in no time.
 Excellent Product"
418,works great
419,Its great for our new ultra thin UltraHD 4K TV. Sweet wall hugging setup. Thank you.
420,Bought this unit a few years ago and now it looks radically different. It has kept my TV up on the wall very sell and has survived 3 soon to be 4 moves. If I had a need for another mount I would buy again from this company without a question.
421,Good product and great price
422,Worked Well.  Definitely would recommend.
423,"seems to sag a bit. works ok. rotates and extends smoothly,"
424,"Bought this to mount a 50"" LG in my daughters' playroom. Installed in about an hour (probably b/c I was doing it by myself) but was still able to do so easily

Very sturdy, with no bowing even when fully extended. Keeps it in place with no problem."
425,"I had to improvise by using more washers to mount my modern flat screen TV to it.  The screws are too long for
my TV so I had to add a bunch (5 each for each of the four corners).  If not, you could screw into your picture area.
Each TV will be different.  My guess is this was designed for an old model TV that was thicker than today's sets."
426,It holds our TV up.  That's we asked of it.  Not difficult to install at all
427,excelente
428,"For the price, it can't be beat.  Works great on my 32 inch LCD TV"
429,Use it in our rv works perfect.
430,"Worked great in weight room,as they said works great for a corner and it does,have been buying from them last couple years,never unhappy!"
431,Very nice wall mount for flat screen televisions small to larges. The swivel mounts are very durable.
432,excellent Item
433,Great product. Works perfectly.
434,It's a great tv mount I love the fact that u can pretty much put your screen in any position u want
435,"I swear by this!  You can put it any place on the wall and you get a swiveling TV with a very strong mount. I have bought 2 of these so far and will be buying more. Very heavy duty parts, easy to put together , easier with 2 people or 1 strong."
436,Great price well built easy install on our Samsung TV.
437,Excellent
438,Fairly easy installation and it works great.
439,Nothing to review here. I ordered it and received it new.
440,Very fast shipping and right one Thanks !
441,"Works great. Supports a Sony 32"" without a problem."
442,"I like VideoSecu products, but for 46'' TV, level adjustment via single nut was not strong enough, when moving TV around.
Would work fine if not touched.
Nice that it can do wide 600x200."
443,"Bought 2 of them for my Vizio and Sony LCD , fit perfectly..it adjust in almost all directions. Super happy with the quality.."
444,Great tv mount! I purchased this to mount my tv outside. It is plenty sturdy and the swivel is really helpful for moving it to the perfect location or getting it out of the way when not using the tv.
445,As expected
446,love the flexbility of my tv viewing angle.
447,This mount installed very nicely and solved my problem.  Cost was much less via Amazon.
448,It works well for my 32'' TV
449,"I was looking for a very long arm to support my 32"" LED screen.  This product is excellently constructed.  The packaging of the mounting screws was the best I have ever seen.  The instructions were clear and the mounting went flawlessly.  The movement was initially very stiff but by adjusting the various bolts I was able to get the freedom of movement I desired.  I would highly recommend this inexpensive wall mount TV arm."
450,difficult to put together but once you get it figured out it is very good and provides great flexibility and movement
451,easy to install- works well
452,excellent
453,"Strong, E A S Y to install, fits any flat screen bolt configuration and they give you at least 15 different screws so no hunting through the hardware section at LOWES!"
454,"Of the many wall mount brackets I researched, this unit met my specific needs. I needed a unit that provided longer than normal extension arm length because some times the TV must face one direction, and other times at 90 to the wall surface. This mount provides perfect length to rotate the television.

Surprisingly, the unit shows up assembled in its box and ready for a quick and easy installation. I did not need the extension arms, and these were not pre-installed for obvious reasons that fewer installations require them. Of the TV wall mounts I have installed in the past (quite a few for myself, friends, family, and neighbors), this one is by far the best and at a fraction of the price of other less-quality units.

The unit is sturdy and easy to adjust, holding up a 50"" 4K television in my home office."
455,Had no issues mounting this and attaching the TV to it.
456,"It is a great stand for the price and works great. The problem for me it don't fit my 25"" Samsung TV with  a 3 inch square mounting holes.  The hole pattern on the stand doesn't accommodate that small  of a pattern.  You will need to do some re-drilling of the stand bracket or get a plate that can be bolted on to the existing mounting to accommodate the smaller hole pattern. Other than that it is a great"
457,Cheap. Well made. Worked well.
458,I have 4 TV's all mounted on these.  They are easy to put up and attach to the TV.  They rotate and swing in every direction.  I recommend them all the time.
459,Was supposed to be delivered two days ago from a location about 1 or 1.25 hours away.
460,for my plasma works great
461,"I bought this on Amazon for 1/4th of the price in the stores. It has been used to mount both a 40 inch and a 32 inch TV with no issues. It is well built, sturdy and I was never worried that the TVs would come crashing to the ground while on this mount. It is easy enough to do with 1 person (and I'm a girl!). One word of caution...DO NOT use the level that comes with it if you actually want it to be level. Oh, and I would recommend buying different bolts that have sturdier heads. I didn't even attempt to use the bolts that came with this unit because of previous experience (with different products) having the bolt heads snap off halfway in the wall; go to the hardware store and spend $2 to get solid bolts...you won't be sorry when the heads don't snap off."
462,"I mounted my 42"" Sony that weighs in around 35 pounds to this and it worked perfectly.  I had to tighten the bolts that swivel the tv up and down as it kept ""slipping"" downward on me - but no big deal: I didn't need it to swivel like that anyhow.  Very well built and secure - I trust my daughter standing under it if I had to."
463,I have bought two of these videos ecru tv mounts and both have worked great. I used one for 42 inch and one for 32 inch. I like the tilt because one is up high and like pulling it in and out to move towards different directions. It feels secure and holds the tv well. One of mine is even a older flat screen and more heavy than newer ones.
464,great
465,perfect
466,Easy install and swivel view is great
467,Easy to install and does the job.
468,"This is a really nice, impressive, mount more versatile and durable than I expected for the cost. And, it came with all necessary hardware. I lag bolted it through the wall into a stud. It works so well for our 19"" HD TV mounted in front of the treadmill, I bought a second one for a garage tv."
469,"Had major surgery, which left me having to spend a lot of time in bed.  Needed something to mount a new flat screen on to help with recovery and this did the trick.  That was almost two years ago and it's still going strong.  No complaints here!  Recommend without hesitation."
470,"You just can't beat the value of this.  Easy installation, works on small and large TVs."
471,Awesome!
472,HEAVY DUTY!! Actually very heavy.
473,"We got this for our 46 inch 3D Samsung TV. It did work but we had to play with it and ended up using only one bolt on the four arms at either end; and also had to buy extra spacers so that the bolts did not sink into the TV. Once we figured that out it was only a matter of mounting. Be sure you mount it on a stud. For the position we wanted it at we actually had to add a stud and while at it we wired all the 115V , HDMI, coax and Audio wires through the wall.

Half instructions are in a tiny print on the box and the other half is on the inserts. That's not good. I like my manuals all stored in one place for future use."
474,Item met or exceeded all expectations.
475,"as described, works great"
476,"Mount 47"" TV with this. Moved and took it with me. Once in standard wall installation, the other time in a non-standard over window position. Easily adapted to both situations. Easy to reposition angle horizontally and vertically. Great value, I would recommend."
477,good
478,"Inexpensive, easy to set up, plenty of versatility regarding size of TV. Highly recommended."
479,"Does a good job holding up a 55"" LCD.  I like the way it swivels and folds forward.  Well constructed."
480,Recieved quickly. Exactly what I needed.
481,Use one of these indoors and outdoors. Works flawlessly.
482,really nice
483,"Used to mount a 47"" LG LCD.  I keep this thing extended fully from the wall almost all of the time with the tv at a perpendicular angle to the wall.  I was skeptical any stand would hold up for this kind of use long term.  Its pretty easy to install even if there weren't instructions (2 bolts).  It's held up perfectly so far, no wobble or anything.  Feels sturdy like it will last forever.  Good buy."
484,It was easy to install for my cousin and it extended very far. This mount provides its user a convenient television experience.
485,returned it
486,"Excellent service, I am very pleased."
487,It took a bit of tweaking to get the arms just right but after that it seems to get the job done. This is my first motion mount so I can't say if there are any better.
488,Returned product.  Did not need it
489,good
490,"While I'm pretty sure I got the wrong item when I ordered this mount that supports larger TV / Monitors, the one I have supports larger than what I needed it for, so I'm not complaining. I have a somewhat heavy Hanspree 28"" TV / Monitor that works very well with the VideoSecu brand. I LOVE being able to swing and swivel it however I want. The only downside to these are that the tilt angle is not great, but with newer TVs, the viewing angles are much better than they were in 2008-2010, so it matters a little less. I mounted mine upside down because of the position over the window, and under a shelf with my routers and it works awesome. Very happy with this swivel style mount. Exactly what I wanted, even if I did get a wrong, smaller version."
491,works fine
492,"worked perfectly to place a tv in the corner and have it angle out to the rest of the room.  good flexibility with tilting the arms, and very easy to install into one stud.  would recommend."
493,"excellent, has solved a need for my personal use in"
494,Great product
495,Love it
496,"Solid. Works as advertised. Comes with all the hardware you'd need... many options for fitting to your setup.

I picked it for the 24"" reach. 32"" Samsung TV. Swing it over the desk, it's a third computer monitor...swing it back to the wall, it's a TV. I couldn't believe the price, but the reviews here gave me the confidence to try it."
497,"I'm using it on my kitchens wall with a 32 inch TV .So far this mount had been working for me , I was hesitating at the beginning just because of the price but this mount is really good . I would recommended."
498,"Love this product! I bought this for a 46"" tv and plan on ordering another for a 27"".

Installation was fairly smooth. Took my husband and I about 20 minutes maybe. We weren't timing it but it didn't take long. Actually, the hardest part of the installation was lifting the tv onto it. The directions are pretty straight forward, at least we didn't get confused. It comes out of the box almost completely put together and you actually have to take it partially take it apart to conduct the install.

NOTE: the tv will swivel 15 degrees to each side. As in if you were to try to rotate the tv in 360 circle. We took the whole thing down thinking that we installed it crooked but the part that attaches to the back of the tv is meant to be adjusted for this and that is what we had to correct."
499,Super easy super strong!
500,"Bought it to hang my 43"" Samsung Plasma. I really like the 24"" reach. Lots of flexibility. very strong. Been using it for over half the year and hasn't shown signs of sag.

Only problem I have was that the mounting plate blocked the power cord from the TV! Therefore I had to plug the cord (with some jigging around and loosening of screws) in first before mounting. One star off for this oddity. Or maybe it's a Samsung thing?"
501,"Great, arrived in good time and is everything that I hoped for! Which was that it would come out from the wall far enough and swivel for a 40 in tv in the bedroom."
502,"Highly recommend.  I liked the ease of installation and the sturdiness I bought a second one for our other tv.....  (hung a 50"" LG LCD)"
503,"I was a little leery trusting mounting my 38"" to such a low priced wall mount but my fears were totally unfounded.  The mount went in with quite a bit of work but I also made sure to attach it to the studs.  That thing isn't going anywhere.  Now the full range of motion allowed me to set up the TV in a corner of the room and I can still swing out the TV should I need to add or change out anything behind the set.  I'm thinking this mount will probably outlast the set at this point.  Luckily, there were plenty different VESA options packed into the box that I'm holding on to just in case."
504,Amazingly great product for so little cost.  Very sturdy
505,works great
506,"As good as the reviews say it is and as easy to mount.  I was able to do it alone by mounting the X frame to the TV after removing it by separating the long center bolt between the dual and single extension arms.  Just be aware, replacing that bolt is MUCH easier with a second person but everything else is a breeze.  Oh and all the extras screws for swapping out different sets is a plus.  I mounted a 32"" ultra thin (15 lbs) Samsung LED."
507,"Easy to mount, perfect fit."
508,Excellent mount for using and hiding TV in cabinet
509,"This is a great buy, compared to a $60 or more a retail store."
510,"My daughter came home from college and arranged her bedroom like her dorm room with a sitting area and a sleeping area. She likes to watch the one TV in both areas and this worked out perfect.  Adjusts easy and fit our 32"" flat screen without a problem."
511,"I am loving this product, it is what I was expecting and more.  I was worried about those extensions on the end and didn't even have to use them, but they are thicker than they look in the picture.  Was worried a bit about getting caught with you get what you pay for and a lot of cases that is true, but I think this will hold up as well as the ones you may spend $100's for.  I also like the range of movement that this has, which is a big reason for this particular model."
512,I like long arm and it work great I recommon get long arm instead of short which I had and long arm was better
513,Have used three of these and they work great.  Fairly compact and real sturdy.  Good price.
514,It is better than spending twice the money on this going into a brick and mortar store. Was very pleased.
515,Nice quality still works great... very happy with this purchase... need to add 10 more words.. so what can I say its a wall mount that I haven't had any problems with
516,"Simple installation. Helpful to have a second set of hands at times, but could be done by yourself. Instructions aren't the greatest.

Holds a Toshiba 46"" LED in a corner perfectly. Feels sturdy.

I don't so much like the look of the plastic cover on the wall side of the arm."
517,"Simple to install. Great price . Fit well to my 47"" TV. The long arms make it easy to move around ."
518,I purchased this to install at my parents' house. The installation took less than half an hour and the TV feels secure. It wasn't a perfect fit for the TV but I was able to mix the included hardware to get it very close.
519,This is one of the better one's out there.  With the adapters I can't imagine any TV this would not work with.  I am actually going to buy another one.
520,"For the price it works fine though i have to admit it worries me.  It says it can fit a 55 inch T.V, i put a 48"" TV on it and it by all means fit, but the thin metal bars which bolt to the TV are obviously bowing under the weight.  I'll give it this though, my TV has hung on it for probably over a year now and it hasn't fallen yet, though i can say each day i am waiting for it too.  The full swing motion is nice works as expected, we occasionally turn it toward the kitchen when we are all in there doing things.  I would give it a 5 star but the thin support bars always worry me so that keeps it at a 4."
521,"I purchased 4 of these for various sized TV's from a 37"" to a 55"".  A couple of things to be cognizant of:  First, make sure you center the mount on the wall in a closed position and look where the TV will actually be when hung and second, make sure you have a helper!

PROS:
Inexpensive
No problem once up

CONS:
Difficult to mount
Instructions are not the best

Now that all the TV's are mounted I'm grateful the task is done and glad I purchased them... but that's not what I was saying when I was mounting them.  It was a challenge to see who would win at times but well worth the savings."
522,I love this mount.  This is the 4th one I've bought and it works great every time.  excellent seller and excellent product
523,"This unit has worked perfectly in holding a 40"" TV in an extended position for months - without sagging or failing.  Very happy with the purchase"
524,"I am using this mount for a 39 inch Vizio TV and it has been great. The installation process was quick and easy and we LOVE the variety of angles that you can get from this mount. We have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to. (We don't usually move it quite perpendicular, but it works to do this.)

My only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side. It takes quite a bit of force to move the TV from one position to another. It's a little hard for my wife to do-- especially with the TV mounted about 6ft up on the wall. It may be possible to loosen these pivot points, but I have not tried. I'm a little nervous about making it less stable if I do.

Overall, it's a great mount. Highly recommended."
525,"Installed easy and in no time at all (finding the stud was the hardest part for me).  Articulates well with the 40"" TV on it. I would not hesitate to look for this brand when it is time for the next TV mount."
526,"This was half the price of the TV mounts at Costco and perfectly fits a Vizio 37"" TV for the spare bedroom. It will work with many different brands so in my book that is great. Strong, sturdy and robust."
527,"The unit is flexible to fit different size flat screens, works great, at a good price.  Installation was very easy, and it very sturdy."
528,"Installed easily, has a nice long reach.  Attached a 32"" TV for the grandkids and it works out great. accomodates many different size TV's and was a very good price."
529,"I have a very early model 42in flatscreen. The specs say the TV weighs in at 52lbs, i also have my soundbar mounted below the tv so thats another 5lbs or so on the mount. I'm pushing the limits of the mount with damn near 60lbs which the mount claims to support and so far it is. The arm does flex a good amount right at the middle connection but doesnt seem to be failing.

I have moved the arm in all positions, straight out, flat against wall and anywhere in between. Does have that ""flex"" to it but nothing has gotten worse over time so im confident that it is a sturdy product... just has me a little on edge because it looks unsafe however feels good.

Make sure to mount this into a stud in the wall... if your relying only on anchors/drywall and you have a heavy tv like me there is no way it will stay.

If it breaks ill let you guys know"
530,"had a couple of guys put this up for me, but they said it was easy to install. I like the fact that I can move it around easily and tilt it anyway I want it to be."
531,Installation was a breeze. Will work with any Vesa mount TV. Tilts and rotates with ease. Can't beat the value!
532,"Its sturdy, holds my tv really good, its adjustable & really really easy to install. An excellent product. I would definitely recommend it.

] I bought this mount on Feb, 2014. Today is 20 Nov, 2016!!! I never thought I would write something for a TV MOUNT again, after 2 & half years!!! Well, here I am! Amazed AGAIN! I was watching a 32"" Samsung LCD. Its a old TV, today I replaced it with a 50"" Samsung 4K LED. I didn't use those 4 extender arms on my 32"" TV, so I kept it on my basement store room. Today, fortunately I found them with all necessary screws!!! Mannn! This thing is amazing. Within this price, they delivered a very sturdy, swivel mount with all necessary screws & washers! My 50"" TV needed a different & bigger screws and I found it in this wall mount's box!!! This is awesome, this THE best ever $30 I've invested. The mount holding my bigger 50"" TV without any problem! & I can adjust it easily. Once again, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this inexpensive yet amazing wall mount to any one."
533,Works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the Big box stores. It is super easy to install yourself too. You just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud (oh yea a stud finder too).
534,"I really like the action on this mount.  I purchased a 27"" monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate.  I would purchase again."
535,"The mount itself seems fine, it just didn't work with the Phillips tv we bought....the 'x' arm things did not line up and if they did then the 'x' parts would have covered the holes for the inputs...........we ended up using one we had had around here.......seems to be built well though and sturdy"
536,"This is not a high cost unit so i didn't expect too much.  It worked well and has given good service now for two years.  It could have a better cable management system on it, but I don't expect such frills at this price.  This is solidly made, no complaints"
537,"No complaints here. If you need an articulating mount for a mid-sized TV, you can't go wrong with this one.
Very solid. Holds in place firmly."
538,It does the job and it wasn't too hard to install so i'm a happy tv viewer. Nothing bad to say about it. Came with a bunch of bolt options for different make and model TV's
539,This worked perfect.  The universal design would fit 99.9% of the TV's as advertised.  Easy to mount and very durable.
540,This was easy to set up and we do enjoy being able to watch TV in the bed room. Then fall asleep.
541,"Worked great. Easy mounting and setup. 2007 Vizio 42"" LCD hung perfectly. It is a heavier TV, around 50lbs and it mounted up great."
542,USED THIS TO PUT MY 26 INCH ON AND IT WAS AN EASY DO IT YOURSELF INSTALL AND IT WORKS AS DESCRIBED. BEEN USING IT FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.
543,"I have purchased a total of 4 HDTV wall mounts from the VideoSecu company
 and they are all quality products at a very reasonable price.
-Tilt TV Mount: for stationary TVs up to 65 inches.
-Articulating:  corner mount for SMALL TVs
-Long Arm:  corner or high mobility mount for LARGER TVs

All of them are excellent products, and very easy to install."
544,"i bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work. I went to best buy and they said to purchase this $350 wall mount they had, I snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box, came home and found this one to be near similar. Needless to say I now have my 47 in LG flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room."
545,"It took about 10 mins to install this TV Wall Mount with a 48 inch Samsung TV.  It does the job, there are much more expensive arms, but this does the trick."
546,"This is the best mount I have ever found, especially for the price.
Home Depot has a nearly identical mount for $90.
This mount comes with every fastener you could need from Lags, Hollow Wall Anchors, Spacers, to varying lengths of Metric Fasteners to most if not all TVs.
They mount easy and are sturdy; I have a 60"" LED TV on one without issue.
I also have 32"", 42"", 46"", and 50"" TVs on them; I have used these to mount every LED/LCD TV I or friends have mounted."
547,This will be awesome if my husband ever puts it up. It is still in the box it came in at this point.
548,"I use this arm to mount my 39 inch Vizio. I'm surprised my TV has a 100x100 mount thingy. It can tilt left and right, up and down. I do wish it swiveled the TV so that it wasn't crooked. When the bolts get loose, my TV looks crooked."
549,"I originally bought this for a Sony 40"" TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42"" instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.

Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.

I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount."
550,"I really wanted to like this mount, but I'm somewhat disappointed.  I have installed many different types of mounts, so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent, but there are some items of which you should be aware:

* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV (as I did for a 37"" LG), then be aware that the extension arms are ""maxed out"" at this size, which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.

* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.

* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.

* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3"" to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.  If you're looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall, keep this in mind."
551,"The TV is still hanging from the wall so that's a good thing. The info for this wall mount says it is good for up to 66 LBS. Our old Phillips 37"" flat screen weighs 58 LBS (including the stand) and after 3 weeks the TV and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical 2 x4"" frame member. The mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts, bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand TVs. I had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old Phillips."
552,"I received the mount, which was well packaged for shipping.  The installation instructions were Moderately clear.  No issues following them, they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on.

My shipment had a mis-cut piece, and was missing 4 screws.  I contacted the Manufacturer, and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day (Shipped out of Texas, so normal mailing times applied)

I like how the Mount fits together, and I easily mounted my 60lbs TV by myself.  The part that attaches to the TV has a hook that will hold the TV on the Arm till you bolt it on.

It's very adjustable, and pushes almost flush with the wall.

I'm very happy, but took one star for the miscut piece."
553,"This was needed to mount a 32"" LCD that weighs 27 lbs in my bedroom. I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.

1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?

2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.

3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)

4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.

5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32"" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already."
554,"I was lucky that I didn't need the extensions, the holes in the square plate the extensions bolt to matched up with the TV mounting holes perfectly.  That saved some installation time.  It is a very sturdy bracket."
555,"We bought this for a 55"" Vizio and it worked perfectly. I would buy it again and recommend it. Good quality."
556,"very secure, we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside.  One of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall.  the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall.  I am really happy with this purchase."
557,I am using this with a 40 inch Samsung smart tv.  The extended bars were not needed.  This is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts.  Many bolts are provided to fit with your television.  It is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways.  Highly recommended.
558,my tv! Couldn't ask for more. Thanks. These reviews require too many words. I could have said what I meant in three.
559,"Works great for a cheap mount. Worked great on a 32"" Emerson LCD tv. Does everything as advertised! Can tighten or loosen joints for easier movement."
560,"My application was to set a 50"" TV right under the ceiling in my sports room. Plus, the location was above the closet's sliding doors leaving only 17"" of vertical space on the wall. This mount allowed for such a tiny foot print with no problems. And it carried another solution of aligning the top of the mount and the top of TV because of the ceiling proximity. I could orient upper brackets horizontally and use a steeper angle for lower brackets. Because of a plethora of holes in the arm plate I could accommodate for any geometry. Amazingly, this kit comes with brackets-extenders if you need for weird TV form factors. The construction is very sturdy and there is no gaps in the joints. The TV can be turned and moved to any direction without skewing or loss of horizontal. Because of the extended arm it has another great potential by attaching your great old speakers to the back of the TV holding brackets. This might save you $500 - $1,000 on a Sound Bar."
561,"My sister and over 10 of my friends have payed over $100.00 for one of the same mount at many of named brand stores I bought 2 of the same wall mounts for way less then what they paid for one ""Great job AMAZON your site is one no the best.."
562,The product works great. I have put 2 different Tv's on the wall mount and it works and adjusts great. Plus plenty of hardware for mounting the product was provided.
563,"Very easy to setup, simple instructions, has all the mounting hardware and fits a huge different variety of TV's with great support."
564,"Mounting a 42 inch LG TV weighing 33 pounds
PRO
Less expensive
Previous purchase of VideoSecu product
Appeared solid and strong
Had tilt and various adjustments
Mount on single stud
CON
Sagging..this is amazing that it sags and does so at different angles based on how far the TV is pulled out from the wall
  Therefore one cannot keep the TV properly aligned because any movement changes the tilt or other angles.
Mounting is a pain because the mounting bracket never comes apart from the articulation arm
Critical bolt attachment for the mount from the TV to the articulation arm does not get tight!  This is amazing. It is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use.  This makes the product unsafe.

  I am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall.  I need to get a different one.  My prior experience was with a VideoSecu MW380B TV wall articulating mount, which is far superior for a larger TV.  I bought this other one because I wanted a tight fit to the wall.
  Can I send a bill for my time and work putting it up and taking it down?????"
565,"It is a good value, but is not top notch quality. If you extend both arms in the same direction, the TV (30 inch) tilts. However if the arm goes right, then left, the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great."
566,"Excellent buy! We are very pleased with this item. It performs very well. The instructions were clear. It was easy to assemble. It holds a 47"" TV very well."
567,This is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a 40 inch TV attached to it.  I can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through.  Perfect for my needs.
568,"is not 400x600 compatible but just disconnect one of the screw from the extension arm and move it forward one more, and it will fit, but you will just have 2 screw on the bottem arms and not 3, but it's okay i mounted it like that and it stable. I like it a lot."
569,"Excellent, very good."
570,"I bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house. I love all three of them. All mounts have different tv's on them, One is a 50"", 40"" and a 32"". Product comes with multiple screw for different tvs. Outstanding product for the price. All tv's have been mount for a little over a year. This product is a full motion mount for $29.99!! and it is Prime!"
571,"I have used 4  Wall  mount mechanism already and and help friends to install one, this is the best I've seen."
572,This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.
573,"Great Mount, so many areas of articulation. This was a great gift idea my mother loves it. I have purchased two of them and they are sturdy and give a touch of class to every room you put them in. A must have any video file or those who want to save space in a bedroom or office."
574,"Very sturdy. The arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose.  However, the mount works great, just make sure you get that stud just right. I was impressed with the quality and happy with the price."
575,"Easy to attach. Easy to adjust. Very Solid and secure. Used on a clients 29"" LED with built in DVD."
576,Why pay the $$$$ at Best Buy when you can get the same products for a fraction of the prices here.  The VideoSecu Long Arm TV Wall Mount Low Profile Full Motion works great.
577,"Good wall mount. Sturdy and does what it is supposed to do. In fact, it even held a larger TV than what it was listed as capable of holding. I believe I mounted a 42"" television with this one. Not a flat-flat one either. I mounted an older heavy thick one."
578,Works Great. Holds my 40 inch TV effortlessly. Very well built. Definitely worth the price. Easy to install TV to the mount. Has cord clips. TV can be tilted up or down and sideways. Extends from the wall 24 inches. I highly recommend this brand..
579,"The product is good and as described.

I have a 32"" Vizio TV and somehow, this wall mount seems to be a little too weak for my TV. I still managed to mount my TV just fine, but gets a little paranoid that it will give in within the next few months because the mount won't be able to carry it.

But the full motion swing feature is amazing! Especially if you are in a larger room."
580,"This wall mount for my flat screen is just what I was looking for.  If you follow the instructions, it is pretty easy to install.  We installed it into a stud.  If feels very secure and the TV looks great in it's new spot on the wall.  I don't know why you would ever spend more for those overpriced ones, this works great and is a fantastic value!"
581,"Good, strong mount and quality hardware. Includes all the different size screws required to attach to TV if yours doesn't have them (or if you lost them).  There is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around.  I mounted a shelf above the TV to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long HDMI cable through the wall.
I took a star only because I received a different unit than the one pictured, It has 2 thick arms, rather than the 2-1 that is shown.  Honestly I think what I got is more attractive, but I believe that Amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization.  My unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture, it has a mounting plate with all of the VESA mounting holes in the correct configuration.  My TV is 26"" so it fit perfectly.  I am sure my 55"" would fit on it too, but I have a different mounting configuration for that one."
582,"Great value for a wall mount arm,  lots of options and works well,  comes with a wide variety of hardware to mount in any situation"
583,"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it."
584,"Amazing how easy it is to move my 46"" around on this mount and able to hang off one stud. Nice quality feel to metal it is made of."
585,"I bought this depending on the reviews I saw, got to say it was worth it, it holds my 40"" TV up perfectly and there has been no issues or problems!!"
586,"Totally love this product!! I bought two - one for living room, one for bedroom.  I decided to try my hand in the bedroom first (in case I got frustrated and didn't finish the project).
I've gotten items needing to be assembled before with all the hardware in one bag -- not so with this product!!  I'm impressed! Every nut, bolt, screw, washer, etc. is clearly packaged (individually by size and labeled!)
The Arm also comes assembled -- which I disassembled for easier handling (the wall plate is attached to the Arm with two Carriage Bolts / easy to remove and makes holding in place while bolting to the wall a breeze).

Took me 1-1/2 hours from start (gathering my tools) to finish (hanging the TV)  Oh, and I'm a 56 yr old disabled female.  I do have a  lot of construction/tool knowledge however."
587,We needed something to Extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick. It went up with no a problems. It worked out very well!
588,"I have a full 42"" HD flat screen mounted on this. Not only does everything look better than strapped to a table, but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have.  It was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint, being a single stud wall mount.  The other major point of this mount is how many sized TV or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept.  My TV mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid, yet adjusts with little effort.  This is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the money."
589,"Easy to install, with extra hardware for installing your TV. However, my TV had a curved back, so I used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the TV. I was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall, so I added two 5/16"" lags, under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets.

After installing the Swing Arm wall mount, I grabbed the end of the bracket, fully extended. The bracket didn't sag a bit. I concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient.

I've swung my TV out and exercised the various angles available, and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter.

I fully recommend this wall mount. I've a few other VideoSecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an 80-inch Sharp TV. All are quality products."
590,"Haven't yet set it up, but like that it can be moved from side to side. definitely worth the price!!!"
591,"If you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get.  My 42"" Samsung 3D tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required.  I mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure.  I am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problem."
592,"its a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together, for the price it works.  But for the quality i'd go with Cheetah."
593,"The arm is built steady and has a ton of possible holes to fit your TV.  I had to go through many options before finding a combination that my Sony Bravia needed.  I bought a pair of 5/16"" screws that were a little longer (3"") than the lag screws included since I have 1/2"" sheetrock over plaster and furring strips.  I also put some felt on the bracket being fastened to the wall so not to damage the wall.  The arm moves in every direction other than up & down.  Well worth the price paid."
594,"Could not be happier, absolutely perfect.
Clean looking solid build, beat the shat out of  my bedroom unit (payed twice as much)"
595,"seems like a bit flimsy for the larger models

Pros:
easy to install
articulating arm
will work with the smaller size perfectly

Cons
larger TV's could have an issue being heavier

overall if you have a smaller TV under 45"" it is a 5 star, otherwise 4 stars"
596,I am currently using this for a 46in LCD CRT RCA tv. It mounted easily and also attached to the tv easily. Motion is nice and is very sturdy. Feel perfectly comfortable trusting this on the wall
597,We needed a wall mount for a 32 TV that was going to be in the screened in porch.  This was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount.  I cant speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle.  It's also pretty sleek so it doesn't butt out too much.  It arrived quickly and it didn't take the installer long but of course he was a professional.  Looks great!
598,"We got this one recently and its a great wall mount. The unit is pretty heavy, so you will need a helper. It also includes a variety of screws to mount also. Our TV documentation stated it was a 400x400 pattern. But after putting hte plate over the back, seems we didn't need the extra extenders as its 200x200. This is on a Samsung 40"" 5000 series LEDTV.

The arm is hard to push and pull, but that is more due to being new and stiff. Make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten them.

I initially was scared to mount it (what if it falls if I screw up!!!) but its pretty easy. Not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud, but i also used nails to get the actual edges (those basic studfinders are never ""exact""). make sure you do the same.

not bad for $30-ish"
599,"Too Heavy and Poor weld quality .Lot of blow holes in welding, though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder. I think this is is not well designed by experts. Hope no calculations are involved in making it. Just copied the shape forms some other manufacturer."
600,"Great bargain for what you get. I wish it could adjust with having to turn bolts.

I would recommend this to a friend."
601,I got the product in good shape. Installation easy except it requires two person to connect the TV to the bracket.
602,"I have purchased this mount twice now - one for my bedroom TV, and one for my living room TV.  The bedroom TV is a 35"" LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55"" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)

I will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.

A tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.  You can usually find your compatible VESA patterns in your user's manual.  (Or a quick online search, perhaps.)  As I often say - when buying online, it pays to do your homework."
603,"I got this wall mount for my 39"""" LED HDTV. The mount  fits well and is sturdy. Good price too."
604,"I was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen (47"" LG) onto the wall - what happens if it falls off!  After looking at mounts at Target and Best Buy that were $100+, would this possibly work?

Fast forward...  The mount took about 20 minutes to install (too longer to locate the studs than mount it).  The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully.  Very solid mount and good articulation.

My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.  Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen (tilt) by about 1/4"" since there is only a screw on the bottom.

Overall, I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20"" extension.  Definitely would recommend for a TV that is 47""."
605,"I bought this for a 22"" TV for my son. I mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great! I love the angles it can achieve. Fees Very sturdy and well built. It works perfect for my application. Very happy with this purchase!"
606,"I have a 42"" Hannspree LCD TV. It weighs 42.5 lbs. Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV. Overall, very happy with this mount."
607,"used it for vizio 42"" tv. easy to install. fit perfectly. what is there else to say? strongly recommend for everyone."
608,"I used this to hang my 40"" LCD that I bought back in 07, so it's a heavy TV that outweighs my new 50"".  Everything seems to be made well, it was easy to install myself, and the TV has been hanging for 2 months now from a brick wall at it's full reach.  I can't imagine paying $100 for other TV wall mounts, as well as this one performs."
609,I like the fact that it was at a resonable price and very easy to assemble.  TV looks great on the wall.
610,"For the price it can't be beat.  The mount is strong and sturdy.  Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games."
611,"Very good materials, very lightweight,  cheaper than others brands. I have a 47"" LG Led tv and it fit at 100%, and I'm capable of sell my tv, buy an 55"" and use the same mount without problems."
612,"It needs improment. I wish it has one more hole to put a screw on the wall.
It looks shaky for 55 inch TV. However, it still holds it."
613,this holds up my 55inch sony with ease. make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the 2x4 ur mounting to and u won't have any problem--u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out-- it'll be there till the house falls!!!3inch lag screws is the way to go don't be cheap go buy em.---how much did u pay for the tv????
614,"Easy to install, and works great. Television moves with ease and always feels secure. Doesn't loosen over time like other television mounts."
615,"Compared to many of the other mounts, this one was a great value! Comes with a bunch of different parts to fit different sized tvs. Range of motion is exactly what I was looking for and I have no qualms about fully extending the arm forward with full weight of the tv. A bit difficult to install by yourself if you have a larger tv and if you have to keep in mind how much area you need if you were to fully extend it left and right (arm length plus tv width)."
616,"For the amount that you pay, this mount is amazing. I have 2 and they both hold up a 42 Inch LCD TV."
617,"My students and I used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects. Now I have a 47"" TV for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen. Really stable, no wiggling"
618,"This was well priced, sturdy, easy to install.  You have to mount it on a stud in the wall. The mount joints are stiff.  Even though there is a generous pack of screws of various lengths and washers, I still had to improvise to mount the television. Good value"
619,"Only gave this four stars because it's only supporting a 32"" TV. I think I would be scared to mount a 55"" TV on it. If you sprang for a 50"" or bigger TV, spend a little more on a properly rated mount. As with any TV mount, make sure you're hitting wall studs with the main screws, don't just use anchors in drywall or you're asking for trouble. LOTS of hardware included in the kit, so mounting any style or brand of TV shouldn't be a problem."
620,"Great functionality, really incredible price, and a snap to install.  Honestly, ridiculously good product - wish they were all so easy."
621,I no longer have this unit.  When it was used in the past it also afforded a plave to store my transformer and cable bok
622,"I love everything about this mount. It's versatile, holds our 30"" LCD TV no problem and is discreet. My only complaint at all is that the instructions for mounting lacked a little detail but we looked up some videos and everything was fine. Most of the other mounts I found were twice the price so this is certainly a good deal!"
623,Just to know that the TV will sit off center of where the base is placed. Other than that it has held up and worked.
624,"Took a bit of work, but used this to fit an older vizio 32"" monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor. Stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles. The vizio was older and did not have the standard holes, this product fit and holds the tv very stable."
625,for the price you just cant beat this item. I bought it for a house I was selling so I could hang some tv and it worked great. Good quality for the price.
626,This is a very sturdy product and fairly easy to install.  This item is a fraction of the cost of most store products and much better quality!
627,This mount is just what I needed.  It is strong and sturdy.  It folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  A perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television.
628,"This is a great wall mount.  I have installed three others and I like this the best.  It extends enough with the second arm so that you can mount a large TV so that it fits in the corner of a room.  The TV will hide the actual wall mount and arms mounting to the back of the TV.  This one was installed thru a plaster drywall into cinder block wall.  I used  the 2 wall anchors and bolts provided in the mounting accessory pack.  The 42"" TV bolt pattern fit the mounting plate so I did not have to use the adjustable arms provided in the package.  Total installation time was less than 20 minutes.  I like the fact that you can tilt it, rotate it (makes it easy to get the TV level)  and move it in and out a great distance and it will go back pretty flush to the wall.  The instructions are easy to follow.  Overall, I think this is a sturdy mount that will confidently hold a large screen TV and it does not look like a massive mount like some do."
629,Got my TV mounted with this above my PC and its been on the wall for a year now. No problems with it holds the TV well and its study. Way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what I got i got a 37 inch HDTV
630,"Could offer a little more in flexibility of installation, but once in place the set can be placed in just the right position repeatedly."
631,This mount is easy to install and very sturdy and is very functional and very affordable for the price. A+
632,"Sturdy and durable craftsmanship. Bought for my grandma in Mexico, had it installed and works great. Has awesome mobility to enjoy your television from countless angles in your room."
633,"This is a really well made and engineered product which should be twice the price. It has every kind of leveling and tilting adjustment you could want, and a nice finishing piece that goes over the wall plate and lag bolts.  The mounting process can't be rushed and planning everything out before you start makes all the difference. Just make sure you find the middle of a wall stud for the lag bolts.

It easily managed a 47"" led lcd which weighs 35lbs, and it might take the extra 10-12 lbs of a 55"" led lcd if it's not pulled too far from the wall. Since it can swing out over 20"" I'd be carefull about going bigger than the 35lb 47"" tv that I mounted

The only thing which was dissappointing were the two plastic wire holders which are junk (very flimsy, one was broken in the package) and shouldn't be included when simple black wire ties work far better."
634,I have my 32 inch Tv on the wall and it works great. Easy to install and came with all the parts. The screws that it comes with for the TV will not fit but you can buy some for 2 dollars.
635,"Works great... kind of a pain to install it took two guys and some power tools... and a lot of measuring... make sure you follow directions... also I didn't need all the hardware it came with, come one guys... not trying to make my walls swiss cheese. sheesh."
636,Holds the TV fine and the articulation is great.  We use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill.  Has cable mgmt as well.
637,Got this for my parents so they could watch tv from the bedroom and free up some space on top of their dresser. I put it up on the wall from the side of their bed. This thing extends out so nicely and doesnt feel cheap one bit. My parents love it and thank me constantly for it! Highly recommend
638,Item rec'd very quickly and was just as described. This same item is sold at the big boxes for three or four times the price. Included was enough hardware to fill a store and additional brackets to hang most any flat screen TV..
639,"Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen. This did the job well, easy to install. I had to mount in a metal stud, so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly. Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors."
640,I received the proper item. not the one pictured here. it fit almost perfect. minor adjustment. works as stated. I am completely happy with this purchase. rated 4 star because of minor adjustment. would recommend to a friend/.price was very low. compared to other stores.  pat. 2378
641,"This is exactly what I needed.  It was easy to mount and supports my 40 inch TV (26 lbs) without any issue.  I haven't tested the extension brackets, but the rest of the device is very solid.  I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.  Speaking of which, I've mounted two TVs on this, and the box included screws which fit both (in addition to many more).  However, you may need a few more washers."
642,"Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!

Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).

I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?

Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.

Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.

Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...

The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.

I hope this review is useful. :-)"
643,"If I need to order another, this will be the one.  I used this to mount a TV to the wall in my basement and it allows me to pull the tv out from the wall and turn it towards my desk so I can watch TV while working on the PC, nearly a 90 degree angle.  My TV is only a 32"" and I could see that this would work up to a 40"" or so, but if you don't need to turn the TV 90 degrees, you could get by with a larger TV."
644,"My flat screem computer monitor is very light and didn't need such a heavy duty mount.  The product is fine and would work for monitors much larger and heavier than my 20"" LED"
645,"Good quality.  Must mount on a stud.  I mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall, adding a 2 ft 2x4 in the metal stud track, patched the hole and then put up the mount.  Holds a 37"" TV without a problem,even added a DVD player to the bottom of the TV and it is still on the wall after about 8 months.  Price on this item was great and it was sent with FREE FREIGHT!"
646,it was so easy to install.  the instructions were simple and so was the process.  i was putting off the project for fear.  i should have hung the TV long ago.
647,"We have a 26"" TV in our bedroom and no real table-top space for it, so we mounted it above our dresser with this.  The arm tilts and moves smoothly so it's easy to set this however we want, as often as we like.  Great purchase."
648,"This product is user friendly and versatile.
It is easy to install and comes with everything needed for installation.
Adding bidding could drill and bit"
649,"It works as indicated, but the quality of the hardware leaves a lot to be desired.  The bolts and screws are not made of a good grade steel and strip easily.  Also there's only one screw that controls the tilt of the tv, and because it's hard to reach and hard to use since it strips so easily, you're kind of left with a cock-eyed installation."
650,"I used this for my 47"" Samsung. Its fit/feel is great. Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.

I am very pleased with my purchase."
651,"When we first bought our bedroom tv, we looked at the mounts in the store and almost fell over from shock at the prices.  This is one of the best prices I have found on mounts.  This mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle.  it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv!  You won't be disappointed with this brand."
652,"This is possibly one of the best mounting kits I've ever purchased. I like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of TV. (Whether they have a rounded or flat back). Mine had a flat back so I didn't need the extra piece, but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall.  The adjustable arm is nice, as it is setup in our bedroom. At night the TV is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall, and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk - also making the ability to view the TV while working.

The material is very strong, hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didn't even budge.  This thing seems as though it will last quite a long time.  It's already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom, I'll be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model TVs."
653,"I used this mount for putting a 42"" LCD screen on a wall.  It is a solid and sturdy mount.  I was extremely pleased by the quality.  Hex head lag screws that are included which are a breeze to drive into the stud.  I purchased a mount previously that had a phillips head on the lag screws and that really made them a job to drive into the stud.  Since the TV was rather large (400x400 vesa mounting pattern) I had to use the extension arms off of the main plate as shown in the picture.  They were surprisingly very easy to attach.  A nice plastic cover is included which slides back over the wall mounting plate to conceal the mounting screws - I thought that was a nice touch.

Overall an excellent product and I would easily purchase another if I had another TV to wall mount."
654,"This mount is very sturdy, assembled easily, and had all the parts to attach to the wall securely. While the monitor turns easily from side to side, I wish the adjustment for tilting the monitor up and down did not require a nut be loosened first."
655,"Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!

The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!"
656,The directions stink. Just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok.
657,"Easy to install, works perfectly on a 40"" Westinghouse LCD!  Includes all hardware required for almost any application.  Highly recommended!"
658,The kids more it all around. For game playing . And its holding up .The price what good .  Very happy with .
659,"I have a 47"" TV and had no place to put it in my bed room. With this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging. Very easy to install, came with all hard ware."
660,"I consider myself to be a good DIYer. I've installed mounts for my 2 Samsung 46"" and 55"" LED TVs with no problems for 5 years. So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.
This to me is a major product defect. Luckily with Amazon I was able to return this mount but had to pay return S&H."
661,"5 stars because it was an excellent purchase. It came with all the required parts, the assembly had clear instructions and was easy to install. I am using it for a Sony Bravia 32""... I've had it for 4 months so far and it works great."
662,have not had the opportunity to install the tv mount as of yet - will follow up once mounted in place. great price and quick shipping
663,This is a rather good tv mount. This tv mount works exactly as expected and described. I would buy again.
664,"Was a perfect fit for my 32"" flat screen TV.  I would recommend this wall mount for that size tv"
665,"I hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my 8 year old son because I wasn't going to put the 55"" flat screen on it to find out that it failed. Fully extends out 2 feet. This was worth the money."
666,This mount worked very well. Assembly was quick and fit perfectly on my 42.inch display. The price is impossible to beat.
667,"Pro's: Easy to setup.  Supports many different VESA formats. Has some articulation.  Sturdy construction.  Can be installed by one person w/o too much effort.

Con's: Cable guides fall off easily.  The joints are a bit too stiff; you really have to man-handle it to get it fully extended, and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again.  So far I have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing, but I worry because it is only attached to the studs buy 2 bolts."
668,"This mount was a bargain and quality at the same time!  Easy to install and easy to hang the tv. The only thing I would recommend is to buy separate drywall mounts. I didn't feel comfortable using the ones that came with it, instead I bought 75lb mounts from my local hardware store and used them. Other than that, I love the mount!"
669,works great was pretty easy to put up and does the trick. it is my sons room and really works great.
670,This is perfect for what I needed it for. I can move the screen from side to side if I need to and I don't have the TV sitting on my desk.....
671,This is my first Tv wall mount and I couldn't ask for any thing better. You can watch your Tv from any direction. Comes all different types of screws to hold your Tv to the mount. Also comes with2.5 inch long bolts to hold mount on the wall.
672,"I had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my 24"" LED TV in my bedroom. Other than that, seems to work fine."
673,"I bought the uint for a 32 "" Tando.  I couldn't get the parts to line up so I bought another fixed type."
674,"Mounted 42"" Samsung LED in home office with this mount.  The arm that leaves the wall is longer than the others I've used and pivots in the middle, so it's easy to get the TV in whatever position you want it.  I was concerned it may not be as stable when it is fully extended, but that wasn't the case.  Very stable when fully extended."
675,This device is somewhat weak even for the 46 inch TV weighing only 31lbs that I'm using it with. after some adjusting it's working ok.
676,mounted correctly the first time - very easy - good support - would recommend to all - lots of features
677,"JUST IN STALL ANOTHER SAMSUNG 55"" LED FLAT SCREEN. OUTSIDE A  PATIO DECK AREA WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS UNIT MADE.THE MOUNTING KIT WAS VERY EASY TO USE. AGAIN I DID UPGRADED TO  USING LONGER HEAVIER MOUNTING BOLTS. THAT WAS ONLY $1.00 MORE BUT IT'S WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN. HERE IN EARTHQUAKE COUNTRY YOU NEES THAT SUPPORT. YOUR FLATSCREEN TV RETRACTS A FEW INCHES OFF THE WALL PLUS IT WILL LOOK SWEET FROM 2"" TO 24"" FROM WALL AREA"
678,"The mount works, but it is unrefined compared to other brands out there. Purchased because it was on sale. just ok."
679,"Purchased for my sister to hang her TV on a wall and she and her boyfriend reported back to me that mount works great with the 42"" Vizio TV she got for Christmas and was up securely in no time.  I looked around in the retail stores and found that this mount was of similar quality at a much lower price.  What can I say, it does what it is supposed to do, was easy to setup, and is of good value."
680,"you can spend a ton of money on one of these, or you can buy this one.  hung a 32 inch tv with it with no problems."
681,"Like the various Adustablity, as I had an older model in my living room and it was hard to get it away from the wall when I wanted to angle it.

This one is very light and I can get it to adjust with very little effort, I have some arthritis in my knuckles, so this is a very nice asset.  also I am 5'2"" and I struggled with the older wall mount, this one is in the Identical Location and moves in and out so easily.

You might have to  tighten it up a little more than I have it as it tilts about 2 inches Forward the was I have it, but it is up High and I don't even notice it from my recliner chair."
682,"Great for the money. No problems with installation, everything included. I like that all the screws were with this product. I would buy another"
683,"I have mounted a 42 inch old LCD. Easy to install. Easy to swivel, there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nuts(it can not be changed without loosing the nuts)."
684,Very inexpensive compared to other sites and stores.  It was easy to install and works great with my Samsung 32in tv.

It mounts with a VESA 400 x 200 pattern, which is in the product description for this mount, but was not clear from the 3 options given in the documentation. To mount 400 x 200 you need to attach the extensions horizontally. For some reason this possibility isn't mentioned as one of the three options A, B, C which all have the extensions going out diagonally. The mount itself is 200 mm high, so you just need to extend it out to the sides. Another reviewer mistakenly thought it was not possible to mount a 400x200 TV (understandably given the documentation), so I wanted to leave this info here for anybody who needs it.

My basement room is wood paneled with 3/4"" knotty pine, but there was no stud close to the location I needed the TV. So I attached another 3/4"" wood mounting plate to the panelling with 6 construction screws, then attached the mount to that with the included lag bolts. The total thickness is now 1 1/2"" and feels very solid. I even was able to attach a Roku box to the mount with a couple of rubber bands which keeps it out of the way, but the IR remote still works.

As far as cons: the only one is that it's a bit stiff to move around. However, if like me you're just going to set it and leave it, that should be no big deal. All in all highly recommended for a solid, but inexpensive mount."
686,I am very glad for buying it.  It is heavy duty and good quality for the price.  It was very easy to install.
687,"I have had this unit about a year and it works great in the bedroom with a 22"" flat screen TV.  Very good function and can't beat the price!  You will need two people to set this up, but it goes easy with four hands and simple directions."
688,"I purchased this mount for use in our Motorhome.  It installed easily, and holds our new LCD TV securely while on the road.  My wife is very pleased!"
689,"It is up know and should work fine, but it was hard to get it to fit my TV due to the bulge on the bottom, but I made it work and it is on the wall."
690,What I received is more of a butterfly looking plate And therefore doesn't fit my tv without covering my inputs.  I am going to have to return it unless my dad can't use at his house.  Really bummed as I measured and thought I covered all my bases.  The item pictured looks like is would fit fine :(
691,I searched around for a TV Wall Mount for my bedroom TV and didn't want to pay the outrageous price I had seen at my local stores. This was a steal compared to what was on the market. Easy instructions and quick installation. I purchased this 6 months ago and it is still holding up and doing fine for my 32 inch Panel TV
692,"We had to ""shave"" a little off the wall mount plate to get this product to work for us, but after doing so it has served it's purpose on our 24"" tv."
693,"Didn't think it would work as well as it has,
because the metal was a lighter guage than
we expected, but it hardly deflected from the
weight of the TV, even extended straight out."
694,"This was a present for myself, my son installed it, in about 25 minutes, and I couldn't be happier.  I wasn't sure this was for me as it for my bedroom, but my husband and I love it.  So easy to move the TV no matter where you are in the room.  A great buy."
695,"The mount I purchased is great. It is designed for TV's 32"" and under. The link here, and image are not correct. But, I really thought the mount was build well, was easy to install, and the price was fantastic."
696,"I put this on my outdoor deck using a 32' Vizio LCD. It is strong and tilts in all directions so it is easy to turn to the right angle that you need to view it, left to right and up and down. Highly recommend."
697,Tv has been on wall for a long time.  Hasn't fallen off.  It's metal and considerably cheaper than kits available in stores.
698,"The mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate. The holes don't align so I couldn't put two screws in. I just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment. Then I used zip ties to secure the arm better. I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also, the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again, I did a quick fix. I gave this 2 stars and not 1 because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv, albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount. I should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this."
699,"I have this wall mount installed outside. I have a 32"" hanging on it in my backyard. Easy to install and have had no problems what so ever.."
700,Another gem hidden amoungst the Amazon halls. This works well for my LED tv's. I used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch. I hung on the sucker and it's not coming down. And I'm 190lbs!
701,"I got this for mounting a tv on the wall in my home office. Price was good and it worked. The adjustments on it work well, and it has a gizmo to hold the cables in place. Don't hesitate to buy. I think I am using this with a 38"" tv."
702,I liked it for the week we had it lol. Husband didn't tell me he was buying a 55 inch a week after we got this installed! Worked well and great price!
703,I have purchased 3 of these wall mounts and they hold my 37 and 32 inch flat screens perfectly. I love these and highly recommend them.
704,"Wanted the monitor off of the desk, so we mounted on the wall.  I would have rather had a vertical adjustment as well, but for the price, this unit does the job."
705,you can't beat the price and the installation was simple as can be. We installed it in our office and it is perfect! no problems and was completed in a matter of minutes
706,"This is a great quality mount, very strong and very good price! Diffenately plan on buying another mount for my other flat screen."
707,"I was impressed with the construction, very sturdy and easily mounted. Great price! I would reccomend this product to friends."
708,"This is a great product, well-designed, easy to mount, easy to adjust. I bought this to put a new Samsung 28 flatscreen in my wife's office. With her help, we got everything done in about a half hour or so. The mount is excellent. It adjusts in every way, adjustments are easy to make and everything stays in place once adjusted. The great thing about this unit is that everything is included in the box--screws for the back of the TV, lag bolts to screw into a stud wall, even a small wrench to make the tilt and leveling adjustments. Very high quality product. Buyers should note that an electric drill, drill bit, Phillips screwdriver, and ideally a 1/2 inch rachet socket (a 1/2 inch box-end or open-end wrench would do) are needed, things that some households might not have in their toolbox. I recommend the product...but one must have the appropriate tools."
709,"Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.  I made mine work for my 32"" set and it serves it's purpose. Just wish the seller was upfront on the condition, I could have bought a used one for $5 less."
710,I bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the TV based on our viewing angle.  In order to move it I had to loosed the screws each and every time.  I had it connected to a 27in vizio LCD which is pretty light.  Could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it.  Had to return
711,Sturdy and easy to install. It's a little stiff in its movement but it is nicely adjustable and gets the TV out of the way and up against the wall when desired.
712,"Bought this mount for a 32inch Panasonic LED TV. The mount may look cheap, but I found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price. I strongly recommend it to everyone."
713,"very heavy duty construction, extends, tilts perfectly
a steal at this price
will be happy to buy another 1 or 2 if needed"
714,"Purchased this for a small 22 in TV for bedroom. The mount weighs more than the TV ! That's not a complaint though. I actually took down the 22 inch set today and mounted a 37in Sharp Aquos. Much heavier set than 22 in, no issues at all. It supports the 37 in just fine. The set probably weighs 35-40 lbs. For the price, $25,it was a great bargain. Installed it myself into wall studs,very secure."
715,Awesome price and quality. Simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation. If you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one I'd recommend.
716,The VideoSecu line of articulating wall mounts has become our standard of choice for high quality articulating wall mounts within our home.  The value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our HDTVs conveniently to the wall.  Highly recommend this great quality product. This wall mount will secure any of the HDTVs using the VESA 100 or VESA 200 mount pattern. We like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the HDTV with a larger size there's a much better chance we won't need to replace the articulating mount.
717,"**UPDATE: Had this over 5 years. No problems!

Great wall mount at a great price.  Already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last.  I really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom.  Easy instructions (I'm not a carpenter).  I used this on a 32"" Samsung LED TV."
718,Excellent buy. Mounted my 36 inch samsung LED without a problem. Very easy to install. And came with all different screws to fit any kind of tv. A++
719,"The product is very nice as described, and i am very happy with the purchase. recommend this to anyone who is looking for sword holder."
720,"Cannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web!  All other retailers are over-priced for what you are getting - a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a TV that articulates! This mount is reasonably priced.

Pros:  Easy to install (helps to have a cordless driver to drill 6 pilot holes, and to drive in 6 lag screws. You also need to have a stud finder).
  - Well fabricated
  - Mount does everything advertised (i.e. articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts)

Con's: Really stretching here since this is a good deal: Instructions could use some help for the ""novice"" DIY'ers

Install tip:  It really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the TV mount

Installed a 15.5 lbs, 26 Inch Flat Panel LCD (VESA 200mm X 100mm) to this mount. Mount works beautifully! I originally had the TV sitting a little high on a stand, but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen (inherent problem with cheaper LCD's - not being directly in front of a LCD screen) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to ""tilt down"" the screen.  I would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the market."
721,"I have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio.  It holds a 27"" LCD monitor (about 20-25lbs).  It's been up for a week and I don't expect that it will fall down anytime soon."
722,This was for a 32 inch LCD.  Easy to install and works great.  I am very satisfied with this wall mount.
723,"Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.
Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.
Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.  Make sure you get help when installing."
724,"pros: heavy, solid & stable,
cons: the faceplate is large.
so large I had to cut off an area 3x1 inches just to have access to my tvs HDMI ports
my tv has a VESA 100x100 layout
so, installation was a bummer"
725,I mounted this t.v. in about 30 minutes.  The instructions were simple.  Came with its own little wrench to loosen and tighten the swivels.  I can say I am very pleased.  Money well spent.
726,"Used this for a Panasonic 32"" LCD TV.  Mount works fine, instructions were minimal.  I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall.  I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier."
727,"Works well, used it outside for a 32"" flatscreen. Everything I needed to mount it came in the kit with extra parts for different mounting options. Would purchased another."
728,"I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me."
729,"Compared to mounts I have used on other display panels, this is very poor quality. Motion joints have unpredictable friction. Loosening or tightening joints is good for one or two motions, then they loosen more or become sticky. I would not mount a $600 display on such a poorly made mount. I have returned it to Amazon. Return process was very easy. High marks for that!"
730,"After we located the stud and predrilled all the holes for the screws, this installed very securely and provides a good range of motion.

The one hiccup was the plate that attaches to the monitor - while it had all the screw holes in the right place for our monitor (Viewsonic 22""), one of its ""wings"" extended over and blocked the cord and DVI sockets on the back of the monitor. I had to do some judicious hacksaw work to provide access. This had no effect on the strength of the mount, since it was all past the screw holes. But be aware a little additional work may be necessary on your install."
731,"For a good wall mount of a smaller TV, this is perfect. Much cheaper than similar in various stores, and actually is more flush/compact than I have seen on others with all the adjustments you could want.

Only gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately, but it'll work to get it on at least. All hardware needed is included, I had to use a few adapter pieces on my first TV. Getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall, both are 32"" screens. I feel confident they will be there until I decide to remove em.

Wall stud mounting required, but depending on the stud size, you may only get two of the three wall bolts into the stud. Should be enough though."
732,"This TV mount is easy to install.  Just follow the directions included.  I installed this near the ceiling and I'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt.  Properly installed, the product is rock solid.  I installed a 32"" tv on it.  I know it can hold much more.  The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that, too."
733,"I purchased 2 mounts a few days apart. They were both VideoSecure and were the same price.  I purchased this one 2nd thinking it was the same as the 1st, but it wasn't.  This isn't a bad mount and was easy to attach to the wall.  However, most Wall Mounts let you detach the plate that screws into the back of the TV.  This one doesn't; so once you attach to the wall you have to hold up the TV and have a 2nd person screw it on from the back. Not a  big deal, but most others including the 1st one I bought let you do this. Here's the other model.  Buy it instead!!
VideoSecu LCD LED TV Wall Mount Full Motion with Swivel Articulating Arm for 23-37, up to 42 in TV Flat Panel Screen With VESA 200 100, 20 in extension and Post-installation Leveling System A35
by VideoSecu"
734,"This tv wall mount is an example of you get what you pay for.  It does the job and is sturdy when tightened down so the TV isn't going any where.  The problem is that the TV level is different when the wall mounts arm is extended or retracted.  If you level the TV with the arm retracted so the the TV is against the wall the TV will be slanted when you pull the arm out to full extension, and vise versa.  I ended up purchasing a Wall mount for twice the money but with non of the problems."
735,"Great bracket for small TVs.  I used it on a 19"" LCD and it worked well.  The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up."
736,"Very good item; I am happy wit it, and delivery time was excellent!!  I recomended; is a good support for your LED TV. It is easy to install, and it have extra screws for different sizes TV."
737,Mounting the TV after mounting on wall can be a handful.  It would have been nice to have some type of slide in mount for the TV so you did not have to hold it while putting in 4 screws.  That would make DIY one person installation easier.
738,"Quick and easy installation - very solid product. Very pleased with this purchase.
When in need of this type mount again I will certainly purchase this brand/model again.
Great price on Amazon makes it very easy."
739,"I now have TWO of these fantastic Articulating Arms. One for my computer monitor(24"") and one for a monitor I use as bot a TV and spare monitor(21"") for my laptop.

This is a stable, solid, very well constructed device. Highly adaptible to the many VESA as well as some non-standard mounting holes out there. I was worried that since I was using the VESA 100 holes the mounting plate might stick out to far, but even on the 21"" it doesnt stick out at all.

The instructions are very well written and provide good graphical representations. The arm is easy to mount to the wall, and to the monitor/T.V.. Compacts well to the wall when pushed all the way in, and extends easily when I want to move the Monitor out and around.

Very stable, no vibrations, appears very solid, you won't be worried your monitor is going to fall off.

The only piece missing is the ability to adjust it up and down. You can adjust the Arm left, right, in and out, and so on, you can even adjust the tilt of the monitor, but if you need to be able to move the monitor up and down, this is not the arm for you.

For the money, you cannot beat the quality or functionality of this Articulating Arm."
740,"Made in china, but this time , its well made. nice and sturdy and lots of options to mount differenct type of LCD. It has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want. the value for cost here is big, since most of these sale for over 75.00, or over 100.00 at wm. im pleased with it."
741,"I'm using this with my 32"" tv and I love it. The price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores (walmart, best buy).

I found this to be an easy install and very secure. The swivel is smooth and I can orient my television perfectly. It also has plenty of VESA mount patterns so it will hold just about any TV."
742,"I am very happy with this affordable wall mount for my Sony 32"" Internet TV. One nice feature ist that you can swivel the mounted TV depending on where you are seated."
743,"VERY HAPPY, it looks great, I'm so happy we got it. Holds good, it is a lil hard to get it to the wall. Other then that its fine I love how we have more room in our room. My husband is so happy I ordered this, it only cost us $28 free shipping and FAST(: VERY THANKFUL TO THE SELLER."
744,"Ordered this for a 32 inch TV. Was easy to install, all parts are included and about $100 less that at department store. Great product."
745,"This item serves its purpose as well as any other mount.  Its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion.  I am using this to corner-mount a 32"" TV and it works perfectly to hide the mount, receptacles, and cables behind the TV.  Very easy installation as well."
746,This is one of my best purchases so far. It was easy to install and position. Makes watch TV in bed enjoyable. Now my wife can read while I watch TV without disturbing each other.
747,the arm does  not hold that well when extended. the tv is a little crooked when extended. sticks out at the top of the tv. if you have a samsung this is probably not the best choice.
748,"For such a cheap mount, it works well. I installed in in about 20 minuets and use it to hole a 32"" Vizio LED."
749,"This was installed by two handy men - the first they had every done.  Went very well.  This mount was chosen because of the 20  inch extension.  The wall is recessed so the TV needs to come out of that hole.  The mounting plate sets above the 23"" LED TV an inch but the length of the extension makes that O.K.  I would have done this myself (68 yo female) except the handy stud finder declared the whole 3' wall was a stud!!  With much chatting the handy men were finished in 45 minutes."
750,"For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money."
751,Well worth the money would buy again and suggest item built as good as the ones in the stores for double the money
752,"This mount is heavy, strong and already in one piece. Almost no directions were needed. The only issue I would have: After the mount is installed I had to lift the TV to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the TV up with one hand. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn't being stupid. The directions confirmed to lift the TV and screw in the screws. Other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and TV, then I just lift the TV and click it right in. The sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion."
753,"This mount is excellent. It is very well built and sturdy. I used it to mount a 32"" TV and it fit the need perfectly. The price was also very good and much, much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store. I would definitely recommend."
754,"I gave this mount 3 stars.

5 to start because out of the box, and mounted on the wall, I really liked it for my daughter's room. The ability to move her 26"" TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition.

I subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum, about 2 feet away from the wall.

1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted, the mount seems to sag, even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it. That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to ""fall"" in that direction on its hinges. SO it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves.

Otherwise, it works I guess. But for $50 I'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about. I would not set a tv larger than a 30"" or so on this. I just don't trust it."
755,"The wall mount installed easily and works smoothly.  The only downside is adjusting the up and down tilt, you must loosen a bolt most of the way before you can muscle the TV into a different position."
756,"Easy install, but tv went crooked when it was extended towards limit of extension. It was very noticeable when arm was to the right, but not when it was repositioned towards the left. Too much play in the extension joints. Installed this for my dad and next day he said plastic piece had broken off (Turned out to be the cheap plastic wire-run that never quite fit on right anyways). Went out and bought one from Sams club knowing I could return it if it also had extension/tilt problems. Well the one from Sams Club (Omni Basic Series) was just fantastic and it came with two STEEL wire-run holders even though it is a bit shorter on the extension than this wall mount.

My dad had a brand new sharp 32 inch LCD which weighed in around 24 lbs or so. Couldn't even imagine a bigger tv being extended with this. If you're going to keep the tv flat agaibst the wall this should be ok, but I wouldn't cheap out again. Spend another $18 and get an excellent mount from Sams Club, as this one just isn't up to the task."
757,"This was exactly what I was looking for, a economical way to mount a 32 inch tv in our bedroom high on wall under tray ceiling.  It is heavy and I had a little trouble marking the holes to drill.  My mistake was not following advice to plum both holes, so after I bolted to wall it looked plum but after I mounted tv to bracket it was slightly off balance, not a big dealto correct except 6 toggle bolts are very hard to screw in with socket.  Overall, I am very happy with this, a lot of options to move tv.  HDMI cable big bonus.  Looks great too, esp with cover.  The only negative was to tilt it up or down you need to loosen 3 bolts and the supplied hex wrench too big to adjust one of the bolts so I actually had to purchase new wrench since I did not have any and adjustable wrench will not fit inside very small space for adjustment.  It takes two people to properly install this and tv.  I recommend this if you have a 32 inch Dynex."
758,I have 3 swivel mounts and this one is not the best. If you don't use the swivel feature frequently or don't place it where it may be bumped it will do the job. I prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have TWO arms extending from a longer wall bracket. These more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices. Also look for a feature which allows the TV Bracket (and TV) to be lifted off the swivel arm more conveniently.
759,"Easey to put together and install. Used to mount a 37"" LED flat screen. Instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the TV to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job. Well built product for being made in China.wish you could buy American made, better luck next time."
760,"when i first bought this didn't think it was really gonna work.  I have a 32 inch tv though and this has been holding it for over two months and its still steady and equipped.  When you move the tv from side to side it shakes a little bit, but this is a good product for the price.  I am very pleased"
761,I purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance. The problem with wall mounting flat screen TV's is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the TV you buy. I'm using this mount with a VIZIO E320ME 32-inch and it works perfect.
762,"Very simple set up and ease of installation. I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top hex-screw of one of the center connections (thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the TV)so that I could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the TV as separate processes. Both simple and quite easy. Then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and re-installing the hex-screw. I was able to install a 32"" RCA TV, without any help in less than 20 minutes.

Manufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware, as well as a hex wrench, a small open wrench and a level."
763,Another great buy from Amazon. The local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made. this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it
764,"Don't have anything to really complain about.  EXCEPT there doesn't seem to be a way, or i'm missing it to tilt the TV up or down (ie. mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair).  and i am quite savvy with tools/assembly/etc. And it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the TV to adjust the angle.  No reason to not buy it though."
765,"Great deal, easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy. I mounted a 32 in tv on it and it works great."
766,"This TV mount I bought for just $25 easily outdoes similar ones that cost over $100! It comes preassembled, is easy to mount on the wall, and has clear instructions. It also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall. The joints are a little bit stiff, but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn't be a problem. Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!"
767,"I must admit, I'm very cautious of what I buy especially when I've seen this identical bracket in the electronic stores priced three to four times than this one.  Bracket arrived much faster then what Amazon estimated and was well packaged.  The directions were adequate but I'm very mechanically inclined so used them as a quick guide and had this bracket installed with my Sony 37"" LCD in under a half hour.  My hats off to the marketing folks with this manufacturer as they did their homework and included additional hardware and brackets to meet any possible configuration out there.  Including mounting tools and level were also an exceptional idea.  And tossing in a 7' HDMI cable was the icing on the cake."
768,"This is the second VideoSecu product I have ordered. They are rock-solid, and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package, it's hard to imagine any speaker or TV that these systems won't fit."
769,"Shipped promptly; exactly as advertised; well-made; perfect fit for our 32"" LED HDTV; REASONABLY PRICED!  Anyone who can locate a wall-stud, read a level (included, no less!), run a drill, and turn a wrench clockwise should consider this wall-mount solution."
770,"Perfect... This works great.  I went to Costco to see how much the wall mounts were there, I found it for around $180. I figured why not check on amazon, I found it there for $25.  It came on time, Exactly what I ordered it is not plastic its metal strong. Even though I only put a 24 inch TV on it I would be perfectly confident putting any size TV on it. I love it!!!

771,"This is wonderful. came on time in great shape, went up with in a few minutes. Love the way it mounts and how it looks on the wall. thanks"
772,"I was shooting blindly when I purchased this along with my tv just hoping it'd work. I'm a firm believer in 'you get what you pay for' and i was thinking '25$, compared to the 120$ at Best Buy... this won't work'. However I figured what the hell, with amazons amazing return policy I figured I couldn't lose. This mount works like a dream. I have it holding my 32"" tv in the corner of the room. It supports the weight even though the arm on the wall, is about 10"" from the attached tv. It doesn't sag at all.

You can't go wrong. I'm contemplating picking up some more for my computer monitors. This mount is perfect."
773,"Very well made, strong mount the only problem I have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed. Pictures do not distinguish between Stud mount and concrete. Also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included bolts

For those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1.5 inches wide so this mount only requires 2 lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a 23 lb TV. The four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1.3"" apart so don't try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1.5"" wide.

Helpful hint: I have help install at least 6 other wall mounts because of family or friends so I cannot say that I am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do.
After comparing the instructions on this unit to others I have installed I still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail. Some complain that the back plate was too big for the TV they used but it's fits perfect on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-32LK450-32-Inch-1080p-60Hz-LCD-HDTV/dp/B004OVEUQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG 32LK450 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTV</a>&nbsp;I am using it on.
Works perfectly for the area of the room I am using it in which allows me to rearrange the room without the need to move the TV."
774,"This is a great TV wall mount. After reading the reviews decided to purchase for a new Samsung 32"" for bedroom.  The mount was easy to assemble and mount to wall. Although instructions call for finding a wall stud to mount, the hardware package includes large dry wall anchors and screws.  I opted to purchase ""Toggler"" high performance drywall anchors/toggle bolts.  These cost a couple bucks for a package of two at any big box store and they hold up to 240 lbs each.  There was no stud near where I needed to mount the bracket for the TV mount, so I used four toggler bolts, which was probably overkill.  The TV itself easily mounted to the wall bracket with hardware provided.  TV was on the wall and in use in less than 30 minutes.  Really like the 15 degree angle, which works great in a bedroom.  For the price you can't beat this mount.  Although I will probably never use the articulating arm, it is great for adding/moving cables from behind the TV by simply pulling it away from the wall.  Would highly recommend."
775,"This TV mount works great.  It's easy to use (position-wise)but I can't be sure how easy to install it was, as my son put it up for me (I'm nearly 80) and he didn't seem to have any trouble.  He did seem to have equipment that I wouldn't have had around the house, like a laser beam for getting it centered and level at the same time, a drill, etc. but the bolt holes were matched evenly with the bolt holes on the TV.  I really like it a lot.  Get one and if your under 70, you probably will be able to install it yourself!"
776,"I am impressed with the solid design of this TV Wall Mount.  I think this weights more than the 26"" TV it is supporting.  It also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the TV isn't too difficult.  The one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the TV.  This does assure the TV stays put but if you plan to move the TV on the stand a lot this may be a negative.  Overall I am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value."
777,"For the price, you can't beat it. Mine didn't come with any of the screws for the TV, but luckily I had some leftover from another mount so I didn't want to bother returning it. Also, not sure what they mean by tilt, but mine doesn't. The arm extends in and out as said, tv swivels left to right, but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation. Otherwise, can't beat it for the price as in Target/Best Buy etc., these are going for $60+."
778,"Heavy duty construction, easy to install, could have easer adjustment knobs as I use this on an RV and constantly make mount adjustments. Other than that this is a great product for the price and I would recommend it to anyone."
779,"This was perfect for my 24"" LED monitor, I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems.  It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6' HDMI cable which I was not expecting."
780,"If less money had been spent on packaging and more on quality, it might be a good product.
The product was double-boxed.  The included level was broken. I would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts.  One of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system.  Despite 6 huge lag screws and strong arms, the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates.  Each time I moved it it had to be re-adjusted to be level.  The hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling, it made moving it very difficult.  I used a 26"" tv.

The whole thing went back in the box for a refund."
781,"In the process of turning our master bedroom into a fortress of solitude for my wife, we decided to mount our&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-TC-L32X2-32-Inch-720p-LCD-HDTV/dp/B0039213XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV</a>&nbsp;on the wall, above the dresser, to save some space. (You can never have enough dresser space for displaying tchotchkes, amirite, fellas?) My wife wanted a fixed wall mount but I thought the viewing angle required some articulation. (In hindsight, fixed would have worked, too.) This unit was highly rated and the price was right. Sold.

The installation was straightforward and fairly simple. The only point at which I needed some help was in balancing the TV while I attached it to the arm; otherwise it was all me. I think it looks great; my wife says it reminds her of being in the hospital. (Sorry, Honey.) When we mount the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-VIERA-TC-P42S30-42-Inch-1080p-Plasma-HDTV/dp/B004M8SBOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic VIERA TC-P42S30 42-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV</a>&nbsp;in the living room, I'll definitely use a flat mount.

You could spend four times this much on an articulating TV mount, but I don't see why you would."
782,"I used it to mount a 32"" LCD TV to the wall... about 28LBS.  I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.

PROS:
-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need
-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)
-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!
-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.

CONS:
-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my <30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.
-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.
-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.

CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the <$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier."
783,"As long as you know how to use a level, a stud finder, a drill, and a wrench you can easily install this mount.  After shopping around at a whole bunch of stores I realized that you couldn't find one for this cheap, so I picked it up and was amazed with how well it was constructed.  Just a note, having 2 people help a lot just to making lining up parts easier."
784,"Very solid...we mounted our flat panel in the bedroom. Like the tipping feature and love the articulating feature.
We checked prices at stores, big boxes, etc. best price of all including Costco..."
785,"Received this item quickly and well packaged (But not so well that I was infuriated trying to open it)
Everything was in perfct order. Strong, handsome appearance. Installation Kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios.  Couldn't possibly be happier with this product."
786,quickly shipped to my house and mounted myself. i ordered this for my 32 inch Phillips LCD tv and for the price i paid its a great value. does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do. would recommand
787,"It is a solid mount and I doubt that it will ever fail to hold the 22"" LED TV that is mounted on it.  My only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the TV is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans (up to 1.25"" from one side of the TV to the other ~16"") but for the price I can live with that."
788,Easy to install and the TV is still on the wall after three weeks! I consider this a good value for the money
789,"I wasn't willing to pay $100 for simply mounting a TV, so I bought this item to give it a shot. I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up, which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points, so if you're planning on moving it around a lot, don't use this one, but if it's going to stay in a static area, this is your mount."
790,"I'd never bought one of these, mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores.  I hadn't looked online much, and hadn't really needed a monitor mounting device until recently.

This thing is well built, and it does the job.  It's not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor (TV or PC) on the wall this will do the job.  It comes with a nice bag of heavy-duty hardware.  It is primarily designed for mounting TV sets, but you can get it to work with a PC monitor, as long as it has the VESA mounting.

It mainly articulates side-to-side and in-and-out.  It'll pivot a bit up and down, but that's limited."
791,"I installed this for my sister who had a 22"" Philips LCD. Nice sturdy mount, with all of the nuts, bolts, screws included. Only problem was that since my tv was so small, and I was using the most inner mounting hols on the mount, the outside edges of the mount covered both the cable connection, and the power cable connection. Instead of returning, (then paying $70 from a local store) I simply went to a hardware store, got a 1 & 1/2 inch boring tool that attaches to a hand drill, and drilled holes into the mount. It was pretty easy, but a bit messy. It is not visible after mounting the TV, so who cares?? It is one thing to consider before buying this, there may be another mount that does not cover your TV connections. Otherwise swivels well, does not sag, good value."
792,"Ordered this for a 26"" Flat Screen used in the bedroom...Overall it is a decent mount...It is a bit difficult to adjust and does not move as freely I would have thought...but it does work and it does cost less than many of the brackets...overall a good value..."
793,I wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it. This does that well.  I don't move it often it seems strong and well built. If you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an Allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot. The articulation is sketchy. For my uses and the cheap price this was perfect.
794,"UPDATE: I have now have purchased 3 of these for work and home and with the lighter LED TV's this is a perfect mount for most sizes - this is a great mount - easy to install - easy to use - easy to expand - easy to mount TVs. I haven't found another one that is so useful - even if you don't need it to extend this is still a great mount

--- I guess for the price I was expecting something cheaper but I was quite surprised. It was easy to install and works for what I need it for - it may be over kill for a 22 inch LED LCD TV but I like the way it can be moved around."
795,"Perhaps I misunderstood how to install the mount, but I:
1) Installed the mount to the wall (easy enough)
2) Attach TV the mount with some screws (difficult for one person)

With one arm I held the TV (heavy!). The other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the TV to the mount. It took quite an effort to hold the TV for that long. Certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier :-)

I have another similar mount where the TV back plate and the mount are separate parts. So once the back plate is installed, you slide the connecting parts together. Much easier! :-)"
796,"Mount went up easily and seems sturdy enough.  However, adjusting the TV sometimes leaves the TV crooked.  Also, it is almost impossible to adjust tilt without using the provided tools.  Even after using the tools, we couldn't really adjust the tilt to the full amount."
797,"I have a 26"" LCD monitor mounted on unit.

Seems sturdy enough, would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools.  As it is I keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustable.

For the price I certanily can't complain and would recommend this unit."
798,"I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV.  Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.

The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.

Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most."
799,"I bought this mount to use in an RV with a 32"" Vizio LCD.  It seems to handle the weight fine and was a snap to install.  I especially like the mount cover that hides the bolt heads.  Before I bought this item, I read most of the reviews here.  I thought I would address some of the negatives I read and have now experienced.  One review talked about how tight the mount was to move.  There is a simple answer to that...loosen the bolts on those joints!  Others mentioned how it was a two person job to mount.  While it might take two people to figure out where to mount it, I mounted this in an RV six feet high by myself.  Just take the bolts off of the bracket with the included wrench, mount it, then put the bracket back on.  I also read that the TV was hard to put on once the mount was on the wall.  There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don't travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.  It even includes a small loop to help with cable management.  For the money, I can't believe there is something out there better.  Make sure the bolt pattern fits your TV."
800,"I checked around Amazon as well as some other sites, and decided these were what I needed.  I read the reviews, looked at the pictures and bought two of these.  I received them today.  I unpacked one of them, read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for Amazon.  These mounts are very, very heavy and require 6, yes SIX, screws to mount to the wall.  Are you kidding me?  The TVs are only 22 lbs!  Two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary.  What a joke!  And Lag bolts?  Ever heard of screws?  The other issue is that these are very hard to move.  I bought an articulating wall mount for a reason, and I expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my hand."
801,"I have three of these mounts on one wall with 32"" tvs on them.  Very easy to install. Prevented thieves from taking my tvs when they broke in last year."
802,Well constructed wall mount for TV sets up to 37 inches. The mounting  plate has numerous holes for varius sets. Plenty of extra hardware provided. Price was about 1/8th of what it would cost on the open market. I recommend it highly.
803,"This item didn't disappoint. It's sturdy, has all the screws included for different flat screen models and yes, it works well."
804,"This mount is sturdy, easy to install, and easy to mount the TV to.  The included hardware was heavy duty also.  The action is good, and tension is adjustable.  The tilt can be adjusted by using the knob in lieu of one of the bolts, or locked in place (which makes it more difficult for someone to remove the TV unless they have a wrench with).  I mounted the 27"" TV on our lanai, so a little theft-proofing is a good thing.  The TV is now visible either on the lanai, or from the patio.

I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SECOND ONE, AND THEY HAVE CHANGED.  STILL STURDY, BUT LACKING THE QUICK MOUNT FEATURE! NOW YOU MUST HOLD THE TV IN PLACE WHILE INSERTING THE TINY SCREWS THROUGH THE BACK."
805,"I am awarding this mount 4 stars. I used the Video Secure mount for my 23 inch TV which weighed only 13lb. The hardware supplied was excellent for mounting it on a wood wall stud. The arm of the mount detaches so that it is easy to mount the wall plate to the stud. The mount was more than adequate for my light weight TV. It can be adjusted to swivel and tilt. The only negative was that while the plate mounted to the back of the TV with the screws provided, the lower left corner interfered with the power plug. Video Secure can provide a mount with a smaller plate. Rather than return my mount for the smaller plate, I chose to use a hacksaw and removed an approximately one by two inch corner in order to permit the plug to enter the TV. So with that caution in mind, I would recommend this product very highly. If I had ordered the smaller plate originally I would have rated it 5 Stars. I was able to do the job without any help. With a heavier TV, an extra pair of hands would be useful."
806,"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need."
807,"I was hesitant because of the price but after looking at the reviews I decided to go ahead and purchase one. This is the first time I mounted a TV on the wall so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I put a 32"" Toshiba LCD on it. Mount is strudy and has good adjustments. Installed it in about 20 minutes. Works great and I would definately recommend this for a low cost alternative for mounting a tv."
808,"Quality was excellent. Instructions were clear. It was not clear about a tilt feature, but there was enough to level it when I finished. Be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical. (I was using it for a 23 inch computer screen so I really need it to be level for reading.) Everything I needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situations."
809,"The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it, so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall, or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.

to it's benefit though, it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install."
810,"I mounted this in my RV and it holds a 26"" LCD TV / DVD combo.  Installation was very easy and the mount works GREAT!  I was prepared to pay 5 times the price for a mount that would work as I wanted.  I couldn't be happier."
811,"I love this mount! All the adjustments for tilt and extension are awesome! Holds a Sony 32in Ex-3000 just fine even fully extended. Even bought another. A++

Mike"
812,"I'm using this to mount an older SyncMaster 191T above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price.  Installation was simple, though I used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment, as none of those included would work with my monitor.  The tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle.  I would have preferred another 10-15 degrees of vertical tilting capability, but what is available will be fine for most applications.  I posted a couple of photos that shows it mounted.

Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and would buy again should I need to mount another small display."
813,"What is with all the 4 and 5 star reviews? This mount is atrocious!

Installation isn't too bad. But you do need 2 people for this.

As for quality... there is none. It's the epitome of ""Made in China"". It's extremely flimsy and I was so afraid to keep my TV mounted on this thing that I returned it to Amazon.

Rotating the TV on this is also VERY hard. I think you have a good chance of breaking your TV if you rotate it too many times on this thing. You have to use a LOT of force to get it to move.

DO NOT GET THIS. For $18 I should have known better. You're paying for spray painted metal and some screws.

However, if you don't need to rotate your TV, this will do the job I suppose"
814,"Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.

Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.

I purchased it to mount a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-26LE5300-26-Inch-720p-60Hz-LED-LCD-HDTV/dp/B0039S7L1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTV</a>&nbsp;in our kitchen.

The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.

Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.

I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.

The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.

The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.

The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.

I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VideoSecu-Swing-LCD-Wall-Mount-20-inch-Extension-55-lb-loading-capacity-for-LCD-TV-Monitor-Flat-Screen-VESA-75mm-100-mm-1US/dp/B000R0FG5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1US</a>&nbsp;gets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.

I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have."
815,"This wall mount does everything it's supposed to do.  The piece that attaches to the wall isn't overly long, which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space I needed to mount it in.  The only issues I saw was that the joints were VERY tight initially and as we moved the arm around to install it, the joints loosened up to the point where I had to take the included allen wrench and tighten them up again."
816,"Having played with this for a couple of days I have to admit I'm impressed. I previously owed the 1950's DVD box set using the Bondi software as well, and this feels more refined and faster. I've been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.

The quality of the scans aren't great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. It's possible that was the best they had, since let's face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazine's run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said, on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.

As others have mentioned, the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. You'd think with all that space they'd scan these documents in a higher resolution, or at least offer some extras like separate folders with high-rez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960's DVD box set they immediately offered me a [...] off coupon for this set, which would indicate it isn't selling as well as they had hoped.

Which is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles, pictures, even advertisements are great to read. Sure I'd like higher quality scans, but I own both the Rolling Stone and National Geographic box sets and poor quality scans are an issue for all digitized magazines. So grab it while you can, because I have a feeling this won't be on the market for that long."
817,"UPDATE June 2011: My original review is based on have the first two volumes in this collection. This was a combined Birthday & Father's Day gift, allowing me to comment on the full item.
This installs with no problem, I chose to uninstall the version I had first.
They improved the search engine; I am finding articles that I could not find with the original engine.
Quality of each page is very good to excellent. However, two-page items have alignment problems. The two sides are not meeting smoothly. This seems to be a production problem and is NOT in the electronic ZENO copy of the magazines.
Other than the above items, my review is still valid.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
I have Playboy Cover to Cover for the 50s and the 60s. This item is on my wish list and will be a 2011 gift. While not being able to comment on this item, I can comment on the quality of the oldest magazines and BONDI support.
Cover to Cover is just that! Think of an electronic copy complete with inserts, as it existed when published. The quality is never less than a VERY GOOD quality print edition and most are EXCELLENT quality. I have never been unable to read something or found a bad picture.
Bondi is the software system that allows you to ""read"" the magazines. Searching is not a major problem. Simple searches produce very good results. Do a search for Grahan Wilson or a playmate and the returned information is excellent. Try looking for a dimly remembered story and returns may not be very good. I have no more problems using the Bondi reader than I have with the reader for the New Yorker or National Geographic and the search results are compatible. I have had the Playboy 50s through two PCs and the change from Windows to VISTA. Bondi supported their reader with a download that installed with no problems. The Playboy 60s had an updated version that installed over the old one without problems. Bondi has more than Playboy under their system. If that is your reason for not buying, you cannot buy any product like this.
Playboy is an American icon and a record of the good life for 60 years. The magazines are a trip down memory lane, the fiction is still great, the cartoons are still funny and the women are beautiful."
818,It works!
819,Works great but need a good file management app
820,Works like it's supposed to thanks
821,"Sweet little device enables you to use USB flash drives and hard drives with your Galaxy devices.  Be advised it does not send very much power over the connection, so some external hard drives may not function."
822,"Nice tablet, great price"
823,"This item works perfectly for what I need it to do. It allows me to connect a Bluetooth mouse to my galaxy tab 4 as well as my external hard drive without any problems.

I would recommend this product for any micro usb to usb connections"
824,Works great fast shipping  recomend to others
825,"This one is the real deal for the Nexus 5.  Works perfectly and picture quality is amazing.  It should work perfectly for your device as long as you have slimport (Nexus 4/5/6, LG G2/G3, Nexus 7 2013, others) and use a good quality HDMI 1.4 cable.  To my knowledge, Samsung phones DO NOT support slimport.  If your phone supports slimport, you are much better off buying this adapter compared to MHL adapters which require power input.

I was looking to buy a HTPC or setup a small itx box for running XBMC/TVMC/Kodi on my non-smart Plasma TV, but realized I had a Nexus 5 with a broken screen that was still functional.  Instead of spending a lot of money on an HTPC box, I decided to try out this slimport adapter with my Nexus phone paired with the TVMC Kodi app to stream movies.  I'm happy to say I've found the perfect solution for my needs.

I previously tried using a chromecast for mirroring my Nexus phone, but the input lag and reduction in quality didn't cut it.  Audio was a little off sync with chromecast also.  I haven't noticed any input lag, display problems or artifacts with this slimport adapter at all. Audio over hdmi works through the slimport adapter just fine.

There are many generic style and older slimport adapters for sale on amazon that are problematic, but after reading the reviews of this particular one and using it myself, I can vouch for it.

One little tip I'd like to add if you plan to use this slimport adapter with a smartphone for TVMC/Kodi is to download the Yatse remote app.  You can use your OTHER phone as a remote over wifi to control the device attached to the slimport adapter.  Perfect!"
826,didnt work
827,"Ordered this to use the THX Tune-Up app on my LG G3 phone for our new 4K tv.  Plugged it in, set HDMI input and followed the directions.  Cable worked great!  That is the only time I have used it so far, so cannot comment on longevity.  But for this purpose, it worked perfectly."
828,Doesn't work!
829,Good product but it didn't work on my phone.
830,"I got this item a while ago and at first it worked great. Sound and video come through very well and it was just plug and go for my LG G3. Lately though, it does not work too well. I believe it is not getting a very good connection and will cut out. Then I have to go over to my phone and wiggle the wire until it comes back on. This gets it to work but I have to not move the wire while I set my phone back down or it'll cut out again. Sometimes it does it so much and I can not find the sweet spot that I just stop trying to watch anything. It could be great but mine just isn't working. I have no problems with anything else that I plug into my phone so it is definitely the wire and not my phone."
831,This product is just poor quality. It didn't work most of the time and it seemed that the connection was loose. There's too many things that have to be done to set this thing up. Skip this product.
832,"Purchased this adapter a few months ago, I noticed a flicker after 1 month but now it does not work at all. A wise person said ""Cheap thing no good...good thing no cheap"""
833,works
834,Did not work at all. Seems like they may be tryinig to offload non working electronics on people and hope most don't bother to request a refund. Took an inordinately long amount of time to receive the product as well.
835,"Works great- you don't even need the power source. And yes, it works for my phone swimmingly. I just wish it worked with my tablet as well."
836,It works well but cut out often.
837,Trivial to use. No setup required. Just plug it in and your device screen is mirrored to a display over HDMI.
838,It kind of worked for a little while. Typical Chinese electronics junk
839,"It has been great to utilize my unlimited data plan by directly connecting to my TV.  Need to remember to shut off all notification sounds since you have to turn up the volume on the TV and when a notification comes in it is crazy loud.  Youtube and other low resolution feeds don't work that great, but Netflix HD and Hulu look good on an 80"" TV from the LG G3."
840,"GREAT product!!!!!!!! Fits my LG pad
Also lgg3 phone"
841,Worked on my galaxy player 5. Expensive but worth it if you need the space. It appears to work in many gadgets not listed for this new format.
842,"Great addition to our new Galaxy S9's which, by the way, do not come with any SD media.  Was able to transfer data from my old phone's SD card quickly and easily."
843,Perfect !
844,As described.
845,Great little card made my device better
846,Item as described.  Fast shipping.  A++
847,Great little card. Great storage and fast shipping
848,Whatever i put on this memory it stayed unlike in my own memory.....
849,Sandisk is my favorite because of the company having Israeli origins.
850,Great brand name. I have never had a problem with any sandisk products.
851,Good value
852,"was awesome untill it caught on fire,... probably cuz the raspberry pi caught on fire, .. there was a lot on fire.. always check the power supply before connecting devices,,.on a side note, raspberry pis will NOT handle 120v AC at either the input or USB.. trust me"
853,constantly needed more space until I bought this. great size and quality no issues yet.
854,it really slow..can't save 4K on it..
855,Works well - quality product - Using it in my cell phone for pic/video
856,Perfect
857,I am very happy with my item Thanks for fast shipment
858,As advertised.
859,Haven't needed any more memory since getting this
860,Took a ton of pictures and videos on vacation with a GoPro - nice price
861,Works well in car cameras
862,"Bought this for my Raspberry Pi. No issues with filesystem corruption in a device that can and will be disconnected from power abruptly, but I have a system image prepared just in case."
863,"exactly as shown, works properly"
864,Great  Works very well.
865,Works Awesome in my GoPro Hero Session.
866,worked great in my go pro 4 black
867,Another great card.  I really notice no difference between any of them so I buy the one on sale.  This one was.  Great videos Great stills.
868,Very durable.
869,"exactly as advertised, I can watch things from my cell on the TV."
870,"First the LG G3 is an amazing phone.  This is why I took the next step and bought this adapter.  Connected phone to 55"" HDTV, turned phone sideways, and was watching high def streaming TV via phone apps in full HD resolution (e.g. no black bars on top/bottom).

One thing to note about the packaging.  On Amazon it says for LG G3, but when I received it the box does not explicitly state support for LG G3.  My assumption is LG uses the same connection setup as prior LG phones - thank goodness LG stayed with their standard connection port."
871,"Worked perfectly. One side goes into the LG G3 (mine is from T-Mobile) the other will connect to your HDMI Cable (in my case, I connected it to the Asus S1 travel projector) and you even have a plug on the side so you can charge it while it's working. It transfers audio and video in great quality.

Once connected, your monitor/projector/display will basically mimic exactly what you see on the phone. With NO lag. It's like working on a giant phone. I was especially happy to find out that if you use the built in Video playing app on the LG G3, it knows you have connected an external device when playing videos and will let you turn the screen off to save battery while playing a video. The projector is even smart enough to change the orientation based on how the phone is held.

I got my phone connected to a couple of Philips ShoqBox bluetooth speakers and now it's officially MOVIE TIME!"
872,great value
873,"good stuff, as always"
874,good
875,Complete trash. You will spend more time trying to get it to work than actually enjoying the product. Once you finally get it to work the slightest movement will mess everything up
876,"Quality and build are excellent.  I bought it to try it on my LG Stylo but this phone will not recognize the device, it's the phone's fault, not the Slimport.  The Stylo just does not have video out through the USB."
877,"Doesn't work too well with my lg v10, and the sad thing is that it's specifically for my phone, just a bad product, a waste of money"
878,Exactly as expected .. good card.
879,Delivered in good condition and is working well.
880,Works well.
881,"I bought this to use on my Android phone to cast to a monitor.  It is a little slow on the refresh to the monitor but not enough to keep me from working. or casting videos.  I am an IT person so I use to on external monitor with my phone when I connect remotely to my work.
The build quality could be better, if you move the HDMI cable it tends to drop the signal for a second, but if the phone is not moving around then you are good."
882,Did not work for LG g3 at all
883,Didn't work!
884,Excellent
885,works great.
886,"It works well, using it for a Raspberry pi build. Very impressed by the transfer speeds for what I am using it for."
887,"SanDisk brands are my favorite, never had any problems. They're guanteed. I am a power user, in photography, on my cellphone and to me ""external storage"" is important. I need a product that will not fail on me. The SanDisk Ultra lets you transfer large files at great speed. It does make a big difference, and to top it all, the price is phenomenally great. 5 stars in my book. Thank you."
888,Works as expected.
889,"No issues. Works with GoPro, GoPro knock-offs, and with the adapter to standard SD cards, with Canon 60D, Canon C100, BMPCC, and Panasonic GH4 cameras."
890,Keeps cutting out... phone screen image on TV connects then goes blank after 10 or 15 seconds. Does not work at all when connected to USB power to prevent phone battery discharge. .  Tried to order 2 more from different seller in China.  Never received order and seller (yanzzshop) is slow in responding to inquiry for items never received
891,"Its works on and off, the main cable has a sweet spot and I highly recommend an higher amp micro usb brick to power this as its needed"
892,Excellent ! Excellent ! Excellent !
893,It does connect to my tv and gives me images and audio but it does not charge my phone so I have to watch with a fully charged phone and only for as long as the charge lasts...
894,"I had given this item a 1 star and bad review because I wasn't giving any instructions of how it worked.  Now that I know how to properly use it I changed it to 5 stars.  The proper way to use it is #1 you need your phone charger to plug it in the small port of the slim port to give it power to display it on your TV.  This does not mean it will charge your phone at the same time too.  On some phone it will charge your device (G4). Now #2 this one is important, you have to put your phone on airplane mode in order not to lose connection from your device to your TV.  If you don't do this video from your phone to the TV will be cutting in and out all the time or won't display it at all.  On some phones it might work without using airplane mode.  But I know that on mine (G4) it won't work unless I put it on airplane mode. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy your product!!.. I was pretty close to throwing mine away in frustration. Glad I did not!"
895,Works great in my GoPro Hero 5 Black
896,Great!
897,A top-notched 64GB microSDXC chip for my LUMIX 4K Panasonic camera that worked perfectly.
898,Great
899,"I bought this for my Raspberry Pi 3 and it does work. So if you are wondering about compatibility, it is compatible. Nice to finally have 64 gigs of storage."
900,"Works just fine for LG G4.
I think it should work well for other Androids too, don't know why not.
USB Connection is standard Android.  I don't know if LG puts out a unique signal that requires this.
If I get a chance to learn how it is with others, I may come back to this.
Of course you need a standard HDMI cable to plug into it."
901,As described
902,No complaints here. Five stars.
903,Works excellent in my GoPro!
904,Worked like a charm
905,"Not the one we ordered exactly but ill still take it because its still the correct gb. Not sure if it'll be better or not but ill be giving it a try.

Update: I have to return the item because it doesn't work for go pro. I get SD Err. I tried multiple times and it's pretty easy inserting a ad card into a go pro so it's definitely the cards fault.  I took it with me on a 4 day trip and wasn't able to get any videos with my go pro of all the hikes I went on. There was no electronic stores near where I traveled, so I wasted my time ordering this card. I recommend you don't waste yours."
906,Good price.
907,good price & product
908,works great so far in Go pro Hero 4
909,Stopped working after a week. I didn't return it because Amazon put me on warning for returning 2 of a hundred items.
910,"We've been using this for about six months now without any problems. It's REALLY handy for when your vacation plans get a last-minute change due to weather! Just connect an HDMI cable to the hotel's TV, fire up your Netflix / Prime Video app, and away you go!"
911,"I waited over a month for the delivery of this product, and it does not work with my LG G3 Stylo"
912,Excellent
913,Works perfect
914,It does what it is supposed to do! not much to write about a micro disk
915,Perfect! Exactly as described. The picture is misleading because I ordered and received a 64gb and the picture shows 32gb. I am happy with my purchase.
916,Will work for a week and quit i have three and they just don't work well with the crappie micro  usb charging port. My phone is a LG g3
917,good price
918,Excellent product!
919,Works very well!
920,"I trust and recommend SanDisk, they are usually the brand I look for first. I use this for my GoPro and have had no issues with it at all."
921,"unfortunately, only a 32GB Go Pro"
922,It didn't work with my phone.  Be sure to check the list of supported devices on the Slimport website before you buy this.
923,nice
924,"It works, but you have to be careful to insert it completely into the phone.  Took a bit more pressure than the charging cord, and I still had to rock it back and forth to make a complete connection. So far, it is still working."
925,Worked for the 1st to times i used it then it started blinking on and off as if the connection was bad now it dosent work at all on my LG G3 smh
926,Works with LG G3
927,POS. keeps losing signal to whatever I attach it to
928,Works great
929,Good card
930,"Nice new , works well ."
931,Functional.
932,Tons of video drop out. Don't buy it.  You can be in the middle of a video and it starts to flicker on your screen!!!
933,"This fit perfectly in my Motorola Droid Maxx2. I'm able to save data to it without any problems (you will need to set your phone to store data on the SD card  instead of the internal storage on the phone itself). So far, no problems or issues - it just worked OK right from the start. Will post an update if I have any issues with it.  Just remember that what you can store on the card will be determined by the app you're trying to download,  your phone's OS and the phone itself."
934,Exactly as I expected
935,Still working to this day some two years later.  No complaints.
936,would highly recmmend it..
937,"I've been using this for over 6 months now, without a single issue to report.  SanDisk is one of the staple brands that offers these memory cards, and has for many years, because although they might not offer the top 1% in quality, they offer more per dollar spent on their products than the products that might outperform them.

These are simply a good staple for memory cards, with a long average product lifespan."
938,Works as designed
939,Stopped working after a few uses. I will be returning this product. I have also read similar reviews so this is not a fluke
940,Its in my phone and storing all kinds of digital chit. No problems of any sort. Happily buy another if ever needed.
941,Great
942,Great value
943,Does what it promises to do.  Very easy and straight forward to use.  Need an HDMI cord and a charge cord...
944,Like as described. Perfect conditions and work well
945,It works as advertised.
946,it was worth it
947,"works great, cheap way to add more storage for my tablet - more movies when I travel"
948,"I have several of these and they have never failed me. I shoot In Turkey and the UAE (Dubai), and need a lot of memory. A 64 GB memory micro disk will hold 2600 photos, and a lot of video."
949,"Great size, we use in in our go pro.!"
950,"no issues, fast shipping"
951,Excellent deal and it arrived quickly!!
952,Did not work in my ELPH camera as first purchased.  But works just fine in my new Windows phone for added memory.
953,"A+++, will buy again from he seller"
954,works
955,did the job
956,I use this for my Group Pro Hero 4 Silver. It can hold over 2 hours of video on a high setting. This is way cheaper than any retail store so don't get fooled into paying triple the cost! At this price get two especially if you have more than one battery.
957,"this memory card works fine in my nook hd plus.  it works fine, i've had no problems so far."
958,Use on my sony camera. Works great no problems.
959,Great memory card for the price. Product came on time fully satisfied.
960,Worked as expected; inexpensive.
961,"I was skeptical, but this thing worked exaclty as it was advertied.  Great to be able to watch videos or even Netflix from my phone to the television."
962,"Seller replaced the first one which the connection would cut out periodically, the replacement they sent is also not working, the sound and picture cuts out every couple of minutes, this happens with most slimport adapters I've used for my LG g3. If you need to transmit picture from phone to tv and your phone has slimport, try looking into streaming like dlna or Google chromecast etc."
963,"All of the slimport adapters I have used with my LG g3 have connection problems, this one is no exception. The seller replaced for free and the replacement is also not working correctly. Like others, the picture and sound cuts out frequently. Steer clear of slimport adaptors, try using DLNA or other ways to stream."
964,Works well!
965,"I just wanted this for my Samsung Galaxy S5.  Works fine.  If you're like me and didn't care to research speed vs price vs cost per GB, just get it."
966,Yes.
967,Works good
968,"Geeze, how much smaller are they going to get with these. This is crazy. Bought for my GoPro and works great. Now I have to be disciplined in not loosing it!"
969,good item
970,Works perfectly in my new DROIDE TURBO II...Great price!
971,Works great for my go pro
972,it was a gift.
973,San Disk always has good products.  This one is no exception and the price was right.  Highly recommend them
974,"what is there to say, you are buying price here and SanDisk is good stuff"
975,As promised!
976,It did the job
977,"Good value, good company"
978,Great item and great customer service with great delivery service. thank you
979,Works fantastic with my gopro. So far no problems with the micro card or the adapter and I have been using it for about four months.
980,It is what it is
981,"Stopped working shortly after purchasing and using in my phone. Had to buy another to replace. Unfortunate, given the high price."
982,Works how an sd card should.
983,"Loads of storage space for my GoPro camera. Haven't maxed it out yet, but I've put a ton of content on it already."
984,fake sd card!
985,Works well for GoPro Hero4 black. Can record 4k video with seemingly no issues.
986,Does not work on my GoPro 3+ at high speed!
987,Works well & good price.
988,works perfectly
989,Insert to phone and start using right away. An extra 64gb.... WOW!
990,thank you
991,"Used in a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 since May 2014. Card went into a ""read-only"" state with no way to reverse sometime in August 2015; noticed issues after photos started getting erratically corrupted and would seemingly disappear after several days (power cycle).

Phone wouldn't write to card, computer wasn't able to format, and no device other than the phone was able to read the filesystem. This is apparently a common problem with SanDisk's earlier batches of this card, but this is the third SanDisk storage solution I've had fail on me in the past two years and I won't be coming back."
992,Great!  Much more memory in my phone now!
993,It has been working like it should for about a month now. It performs as expected however I would look for the most current model for this product before you complete the purchase.
994,great
995,"I own a few of these.  They are good solid microsd cards, and work in most devices, even ones that say they only support up to 32GB cards.

Sadly, one I bought ended up having an issue, where it was stuck in read only mode.  I could access and copy the data off it no problem, but could make no changes at all.  For example, no deleting of data (the files/directories would appear to be deleted, and then revert back), no new data (would disappear), and the drive could not be formatted (would error out).  Trying to run repair utilities on it would also fail.  The great thing about Sandisk, and why I use their cards almost exclusively, is that I was able to go online and fill out a warranty claim, and in less than 48 hours they sent me a postage paid mailing label to return the faulty card to them for a replacement.

While the prices for sandisk microsd cards are often among the cheapest anyway, it's worth paying a bit more to buy from a company that stands by their products 100% and makes things so easy and quick for their customers who do happen to experience a rare problem.

I'm a loyal sandisk customer, and Sandisk is loyal to their customers who trust them with their data storage needs."
996,works like a charm. Price was great
997,Very fast sd memory! works great with the GoPro
998,"I have purchased and used two with the Hero Black 4 and so far they have worked fine. The video quality seemed to transfer nicely and the transfer speed seems quick enough. Their build is about average for an SD card as far as I can tell. I wouldn't recommend playing finger football with them but to each his own.

Unfortunately, the camera itself is a bit shaky when I record, but I highly doubt that has anything to do with the memory card. Regardless, figured it might be useful information to someone."
999,I can't ask for a better memory card...
